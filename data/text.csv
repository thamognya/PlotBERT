My	Story

O

N	THE	FINAL	day	of	my	sophomore	year	of	high	school,	I	was	hit	in
the	face	with	a	baseball	bat.	As	my	classmate	took	a	full	swing,	the
bat	slipped	out	of	his	hands	and	came	flying	toward	me	before	striking
me	directly	between	the	eyes.	I	have	no	memory	of	the	moment	of
impact.

The	bat	smashed	into	my	face	with	such	force	that	it	crushed	my
nose	into	a	distorted	U-shape.	The	collision	sent	the	soft	tissue	of	my
brain	slamming	into	the	inside	of	my	skull.	Immediately,	a	wave	of
swelling	surged	throughout	my	head.	In	a	fraction	of	a	second,	I	had	a
broken	nose,	multiple	skull	fractures,	and	two	shattered	eye	sockets.

When	I	opened	my	eyes,	I	saw	people	staring	at	me	and	running
over	to	help.	I	looked	down	and	noticed	spots	of	red	on	my	clothes.
One	of	my	classmates	took	the	shirt	off	his	back	and	handed	it	to	me.	I
used	it	to	plug	the	stream	of	blood	rushing	from	my	broken	nose.
Shocked	and	confused,	I	was	unaware	of	how	seriously	I	had	been
injured.

My	teacher	looped	his	arm	around	my	shoulder	and	we	began	the
long	walk	to	the	nurse’s	office:	across	the	field,	down	the	hill,	and	back
into	school.	Random	hands	touched	my	sides,	holding	me	upright.	We
took	our	time	and	walked	slowly.	Nobody	realized	that	every	minute
mattered.

When	we	arrived	at	the	nurse’s	office,	she	asked	me	a	series	of

questions.

“What	year	is	it?”

“1998,”	I	answered.	It	was	actually	2002.

“Who	is	the	president	of	the	United	States?”

“Bill	Clinton,”	I	said.	The	correct	answer	was	George	W.	Bush.

“What	is	your	mom’s	name?”

“Uh.	Um.”	I	stalled.	Ten	seconds	passed.

“Patti,”	I	said	casually,	ignoring	the	fact	that	it	had	taken	me	ten

seconds	to	remember	my	own	mother’s	name.

That	is	the	last	question	I	remember.	My	body	was	unable	to	handle

the	rapid	swelling	in	my	brain	and	I	lost	consciousness	before	the
ambulance	arrived.	Minutes	later,	I	was	carried	out	of	school	and	taken
to	the	local	hospital.

Shortly	after	arriving,	my	body	began	shutting	down.	I	struggled

with	basic	functions	like	swallowing	and	breathing.	I	had	my	first
seizure	of	the	day.	Then	I	stopped	breathing	entirely.	As	the	doctors
hurried	to	supply	me	with	oxygen,	they	also	decided	the	local	hospital
was	unequipped	to	handle	the	situation	and	ordered	a	helicopter	to	fly
me	to	a	larger	hospital	in	Cincinnati.

I	was	rolled	out	of	the	emergency	room	doors	and	toward	the

helipad	across	the	street.	The	stretcher	rattled	on	a	bumpy	sidewalk	as
one	nurse	pushed	me	along	while	another	pumped	each	breath	into	me
by	hand.	My	mother,	who	had	arrived	at	the	hospital	a	few	moments
before,	climbed	into	the	helicopter	beside	me.	I	remained	unconscious
and	unable	to	breathe	on	my	own	as	she	held	my	hand	during	the
flight.

While	my	mother	rode	with	me	in	the	helicopter,	my	father	went
home	to	check	on	my	brother	and	sister	and	break	the	news	to	them.
He	choked	back	tears	as	he	explained	to	my	sister	that	he	would	miss
her	eighth-grade	graduation	ceremony	that	night.	After	passing	my
siblings	off	to	family	and	friends,	he	drove	to	Cincinnati	to	meet	my
mother.

When	my	mom	and	I	landed	on	the	roof	of	the	hospital,	a	team	of

nearly	twenty	doctors	and	nurses	sprinted	onto	the	helipad	and
wheeled	me	into	the	trauma	unit.	By	this	time,	the	swelling	in	my	brain
had	become	so	severe	that	I	was	having	repeated	post-traumatic
seizures.	My	broken	bones	needed	to	be	fixed,	but	I	was	in	no
condition	to	undergo	surgery.	After	yet	another	seizure—my	third	of
the	day—I	was	put	into	a	medically	induced	coma	and	placed	on	a
ventilator.

My	parents	were	no	strangers	to	this	hospital.	Ten	years	earlier,
they	had	entered	the	same	building	on	the	ground	floor	after	my	sister

was	diagnosed	with	leukemia	at	age	three.	I	was	five	at	the	time.	My
brother	was	just	six	months	old.	After	two	and	a	half	years	of
chemotherapy	treatments,	spinal	taps,	and	bone	marrow	biopsies,	my
little	sister	finally	walked	out	of	the	hospital	happy,	healthy,	and
cancer	free.	And	now,	after	ten	years	of	normal	life,	my	parents	found
themselves	back	in	the	same	place	with	a	different	child.

While	I	slipped	into	a	coma,	the	hospital	sent	a	priest	and	a	social

worker	to	comfort	my	parents.	It	was	the	same	priest	who	had	met
with	them	a	decade	earlier	on	the	evening	they	found	out	my	sister	had
cancer.

As	day	faded	into	night,	a	series	of	machines	kept	me	alive.	My
parents	slept	restlessly	on	a	hospital	mattress—one	moment	they
would	collapse	from	fatigue,	the	next	they	would	be	wide	awake	with
worry.	My	mother	would	tell	me	later,	“It	was	one	of	the	worst	nights
I’ve	ever	had.”

MY	RECOVERY

Mercifully,	by	the	next	morning	my	breathing	had	rebounded	to	the
point	where	the	doctors	felt	comfortable	releasing	me	from	the	coma.
When	I	finally	regained	consciousness,	I	discovered	that	I	had	lost	my
ability	to	smell.	As	a	test,	a	nurse	asked	me	to	blow	my	nose	and	sniff
an	apple	juice	box.	My	sense	of	smell	returned,	but—to	everyone’s
surprise—the	act	of	blowing	my	nose	forced	air	through	the	fractures
in	my	eye	socket	and	pushed	my	left	eye	outward.	My	eyeball	bulged
out	of	the	socket,	held	precariously	in	place	by	my	eyelid	and	the	optic
nerve	attaching	my	eye	to	my	brain.

The	ophthalmologist	said	my	eye	would	gradually	slide	back	into
place	as	the	air	seeped	out,	but	it	was	hard	to	tell	how	long	this	would
take.	I	was	scheduled	for	surgery	one	week	later,	which	would	allow	me
some	additional	time	to	heal.	I	looked	like	I	had	been	on	the	wrong	end
of	a	boxing	match,	but	I	was	cleared	to	leave	the	hospital.	I	returned
home	with	a	broken	nose,	half	a	dozen	facial	fractures,	and	a	bulging
left	eye.

The	following	months	were	hard.	It	felt	like	everything	in	my	life
was	on	pause.	I	had	double	vision	for	weeks;	I	literally	couldn’t	see
straight.	It	took	more	than	a	month,	but	my	eyeball	did	eventually
return	to	its	normal	location.	Between	the	seizures	and	my	vision

problems,	it	was	eight	months	before	I	could	drive	a	car	again.	At
physical	therapy,	I	practiced	basic	motor	patterns	like	walking	in	a
straight	line.	I	was	determined	not	to	let	my	injury	get	me	down,	but
there	were	more	than	a	few	moments	when	I	felt	depressed	and
overwhelmed.

I	became	painfully	aware	of	how	far	I	had	to	go	when	I	returned	to
the	baseball	field	one	year	later.	Baseball	had	always	been	a	major	part
of	my	life.	My	dad	had	played	minor	league	baseball	for	the	St.	Louis
Cardinals,	and	I	had	a	dream	of	playing	professionally,	too.	After
months	of	rehabilitation,	what	I	wanted	more	than	anything	was	to	get
back	on	the	field.

But	my	return	to	baseball	was	not	smooth.	When	the	season	rolled
around,	I	was	the	only	junior	to	be	cut	from	the	varsity	baseball	team.	I
was	sent	down	to	play	with	the	sophomores	on	junior	varsity.	I	had
been	playing	since	age	four,	and	for	someone	who	had	spent	so	much
time	and	effort	on	the	sport,	getting	cut	was	humiliating.	I	vividly
remember	the	day	it	happened.	I	sat	in	my	car	and	cried	as	I	flipped
through	the	radio,	desperately	searching	for	a	song	that	would	make
me	feel	better.

After	a	year	of	self-doubt,	I	managed	to	make	the	varsity	team	as	a

senior,	but	I	rarely	made	it	on	the	field.	In	total,	I	played	eleven
innings	of	high	school	varsity	baseball,	barely	more	than	a	single	game.

Despite	my	lackluster	high	school	career,	I	still	believed	I	could

become	a	great	player.	And	I	knew	that	if	things	were	going	to
improve,	I	was	the	one	responsible	for	making	it	happen.	The	turning
point	came	two	years	after	my	injury,	when	I	began	college	at	Denison
University.	It	was	a	new	beginning,	and	it	was	the	place	where	I	would
discover	the	surprising	power	of	small	habits	for	the	first	time.

HOW	I	LEARNED	ABOUT	HABITS

Attending	Denison	was	one	of	the	best	decisions	of	my	life.	I	earned	a
spot	on	the	baseball	team	and,	although	I	was	at	the	bottom	of	the
roster	as	a	freshman,	I	was	thrilled.	Despite	the	chaos	of	my	high
school	years,	I	had	managed	to	become	a	college	athlete.

I	wasn’t	going	to	be	starting	on	the	baseball	team	anytime	soon,	so	I
focused	on	getting	my	life	in	order.	While	my	peers	stayed	up	late	and

played	video	games,	I	built	good	sleep	habits	and	went	to	bed	early
each	night.	In	the	messy	world	of	a	college	dorm,	I	made	a	point	to
keep	my	room	neat	and	tidy.	These	improvements	were	minor,	but
they	gave	me	a	sense	of	control	over	my	life.	I	started	to	feel	confident
again.	And	this	growing	belief	in	myself	rippled	into	the	classroom	as	I
improved	my	study	habits	and	managed	to	earn	straight	A’s	during	my
first	year.

A	habit	is	a	routine	or	behavior	that	is	performed	regularly—and,	in

many	cases,	automatically.	As	each	semester	passed,	I	accumulated
small	but	consistent	habits	that	ultimately	led	to	results	that	were
unimaginable	to	me	when	I	started.	For	example,	for	the	first	time	in
my	life,	I	made	it	a	habit	to	lift	weights	multiple	times	per	week,	and	in
the	years	that	followed,	my	six-foot-four-inch	frame	bulked	up	from	a
featherweight	170	to	a	lean	200	pounds.

When	my	sophomore	season	arrived,	I	earned	a	starting	role	on	the

pitching	staff.	By	my	junior	year,	I	was	voted	team	captain	and	at	the
end	of	the	season,	I	was	selected	for	the	all-conference	team.	But	it	was
not	until	my	senior	season	that	my	sleep	habits,	study	habits,	and
strength-training	habits	really	began	to	pay	off.

Six	years	after	I	had	been	hit	in	the	face	with	a	baseball	bat,	flown	to

the	hospital,	and	placed	into	a	coma,	I	was	selected	as	the	top	male
athlete	at	Denison	University	and	named	to	the	ESPN	Academic	All-
America	Team—an	honor	given	to	just	thirty-three	players	across	the
country.	By	the	time	I	graduated,	I	was	listed	in	the	school	record
books	in	eight	different	categories.	That	same	year,	I	was	awarded	the
university’s	highest	academic	honor,	the	President’s	Medal.

I	hope	you’ll	forgive	me	if	this	sounds	boastful.	To	be	honest,	there

was	nothing	legendary	or	historic	about	my	athletic	career.	I	never
ended	up	playing	professionally.	However,	looking	back	on	those
years,	I	believe	I	accomplished	something	just	as	rare:	I	fulfilled	my
potential.	And	I	believe	the	concepts	in	this	book	can	help	you	fulfill
your	potential	as	well.

We	all	face	challenges	in	life.	This	injury	was	one	of	mine,	and	the
experience	taught	me	a	critical	lesson:	changes	that	seem	small	and
unimportant	at	first	will	compound	into	remarkable	results	if	you’re
willing	to	stick	with	them	for	years.	We	all	deal	with	setbacks	but	in	the
long	run,	the	quality	of	our	lives	often	depends	on	the	quality	of	our

habits.	With	the	same	habits,	you’ll	end	up	with	the	same	results.	But
with	better	habits,	anything	is	possible.

Maybe	there	are	people	who	can	achieve	incredible	success

overnight.	I	don’t	know	any	of	them,	and	I’m	certainly	not	one	of	them.
There	wasn’t	one	defining	moment	on	my	journey	from	medically
induced	coma	to	Academic	All-American;	there	were	many.	It	was	a
gradual	evolution,	a	long	series	of	small	wins	and	tiny	breakthroughs.
The	only	way	I	made	progress—the	only	choice	I	had—was	to	start
small.	And	I	employed	this	same	strategy	a	few	years	later	when	I
started	my	own	business	and	began	working	on	this	book.

HOW	AND	WHY	I	WROTE	THIS	BOOK

In	November	2012,	I	began	publishing	articles	at	jamesclear.com.	For
years,	I	had	been	keeping	notes	about	my	personal	experiments	with
habits	and	I	was	finally	ready	to	share	some	of	them	publicly.	I	began
by	publishing	a	new	article	every	Monday	and	Thursday.	Within	a	few
months,	this	simple	writing	habit	led	to	my	first	one	thousand	email
subscribers,	and	by	the	end	of	2013	that	number	had	grown	to	more
than	thirty	thousand	people.

In	2014,	my	email	list	expanded	to	over	one	hundred	thousand
subscribers,	which	made	it	one	of	the	fastest-growing	newsletters	on
the	internet.	I	had	felt	like	an	impostor	when	I	began	writing	two	years
earlier,	but	now	I	was	becoming	known	as	an	expert	on	habits—a	new
label	that	excited	me	but	also	felt	uncomfortable.	I	had	never
considered	myself	a	master	of	the	topic,	but	rather	someone	who	was
experimenting	alongside	my	readers.

In	2015,	I	reached	two	hundred	thousand	email	subscribers	and
signed	a	book	deal	with	Penguin	Random	House	to	begin	writing	the
book	you	are	reading	now.	As	my	audience	grew,	so	did	my	business
opportunities.	I	was	increasingly	asked	to	speak	at	top	companies
about	the	science	of	habit	formation,	behavior	change,	and	continuous
improvement.	I	found	myself	delivering	keynote	speeches	at
conferences	in	the	United	States	and	Europe.

In	2016,	my	articles	began	to	appear	regularly	in	major	publications
like	Time,	Entrepreneur,	and	Forbes.	Incredibly,	my	writing	was	read
by	over	eight	million	people	that	year.	Coaches	in	the	NFL,	NBA,	and
MLB	began	reading	my	work	and	sharing	it	with	their	teams.

At	the	start	of	2017,	I	launched	the	Habits	Academy,	which	became

the	premier	training	platform	for	organizations	and	individuals
interested	in	building	better	habits	in	life	and	work.*	Fortune	500
companies	and	growing	start-ups	began	to	enroll	their	leaders	and
train	their	staff.	In	total,	over	ten	thousand	leaders,	managers,
coaches,	and	teachers	have	graduated	from	the	Habits	Academy,	and
my	work	with	them	has	taught	me	an	incredible	amount	about	what	it
takes	to	make	habits	work	in	the	real	world.

As	I	put	the	finishing	touches	on	this	book	in	2018,	jamesclear.com

is	receiving	millions	of	visitors	per	month	and	nearly	five	hundred
thousand	people	subscribe	to	my	weekly	email	newsletter—a	number
that	is	so	far	beyond	my	expectations	when	I	began	that	I’m	not	even
sure	what	to	think	of	it.

HOW	THIS	BOOK	WILL	BENEFIT	YOU

The	entrepreneur	and	investor	Naval	Ravikant	has	said,	“To	write	a
great	book,	you	must	first	become	the	book.”	I	originally	learned	about
the	ideas	mentioned	here	because	I	had	to	live	them.	I	had	to	rely	on
small	habits	to	rebound	from	my	injury,	to	get	stronger	in	the	gym,	to
perform	at	a	high	level	on	the	field,	to	become	a	writer,	to	build	a
successful	business,	and	simply	to	develop	into	a	responsible	adult.
Small	habits	helped	me	fulfill	my	potential,	and	since	you	picked	up
this	book,	I’m	guessing	you’d	like	to	fulfill	yours	as	well.

In	the	pages	that	follow,	I	will	share	a	step-by-step	plan	for	building

better	habits—not	for	days	or	weeks,	but	for	a	lifetime.	While	science
supports	everything	I’ve	written,	this	book	is	not	an	academic	research
paper;	it’s	an	operating	manual.	You’ll	find	wisdom	and	practical
advice	front	and	center	as	I	explain	the	science	of	how	to	create	and
change	your	habits	in	a	way	that	is	easy	to	understand	and	apply.

The	fields	I	draw	on—biology,	neuroscience,	philosophy,

psychology,	and	more—have	been	around	for	many	years.	What	I	offer
you	is	a	synthesis	of	the	best	ideas	smart	people	figured	out	a	long	time
ago	as	well	as	the	most	compelling	discoveries	scientists	have	made
recently.	My	contribution,	I	hope,	is	to	find	the	ideas	that	matter	most
and	connect	them	in	a	way	that	is	highly	actionable.	Anything	wise	in
these	pages	you	should	credit	to	the	many	experts	who	preceded	me.
Anything	foolish,	assume	it	is	my	error.

The	backbone	of	this	book	is	my	four-step	model	of	habits—cue,
craving,	response,	and	reward—and	the	four	laws	of	behavior	change
that	evolve	out	of	these	steps.	Readers	with	a	psychology	background
may	recognize	some	of	these	terms	from	operant	conditioning,	which
was	first	proposed	as	“stimulus,	response,	reward”	by	B.	F.	Skinner	in
the	1930s	and	has	been	popularized	more	recently	as	“cue,	routine,
reward”	in	The	Power	of	Habit	by	Charles	Duhigg.

Behavioral	scientists	like	Skinner	realized	that	if	you	offered	the
right	reward	or	punishment,	you	could	get	people	to	act	in	a	certain
way.	But	while	Skinner’s	model	did	an	excellent	job	of	explaining	how
external	stimuli	influenced	our	habits,	it	lacked	a	good	explanation	for
how	our	thoughts,	feelings,	and	beliefs	impact	our	behavior.	Internal
states—our	moods	and	emotions—matter,	too.	In	recent	decades,
scientists	have	begun	to	determine	the	connection	between	our
thoughts,	feelings,	and	behavior.	This	research	will	also	be	covered	in
these	pages.

In	total,	the	framework	I	offer	is	an	integrated	model	of	the

cognitive	and	behavioral	sciences.	I	believe	it	is	one	of	the	first	models
of	human	behavior	to	accurately	account	for	both	the	influence	of
external	stimuli	and	internal	emotions	on	our	habits.	While	some	of
the	language	may	be	familiar,	I	am	confident	that	the	details—and	the
applications	of	the	Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change—will	offer	a	new
way	to	think	about	your	habits.

Human	behavior	is	always	changing:	situation	to	situation,	moment

to	moment,	second	to	second.	But	this	book	is	about	what	doesn’t

THE	
FUNDAMENTALS

Why	Tiny	Changes	Make	a	Big	Difference

1

The	Surprising	Power	of	Atomic	Habits

T

HE	FATE	OF	British	Cycling	changed	one	day	in	2003.	The
organization,	which	was	the	governing	body	for	professional
cycling	in	Great	Britain,	had	recently	hired	Dave	Brailsford	as	its	new
performance	director.	At	the	time,	professional	cyclists	in	Great	Britain
had	endured	nearly	one	hundred	years	of	mediocrity.	Since	1908,
British	riders	had	won	just	a	single	gold	medal	at	the	Olympic	Games,
and	they	had	fared	even	worse	in	cycling’s	biggest	race,	the	Tour	de
France.	In	110	years,	no	British	cyclist	had	ever	won	the	event.

In	fact,	the	performance	of	British	riders	had	been	so

underwhelming	that	one	of	the	top	bike	manufacturers	in	Europe
refused	to	sell	bikes	to	the	team	because	they	were	afraid	that	it	would
hurt	sales	if	other	professionals	saw	the	Brits	using	their	gear.

Brailsford	had	been	hired	to	put	British	Cycling	on	a	new	trajectory.

What	made	him	different	from	previous	coaches	was	his	relentless
commitment	to	a	strategy	that	he	referred	to	as	“the	aggregation	of
marginal	gains,”	which	was	the	philosophy	of	searching	for	a	tiny
margin	of	improvement	in	everything	you	do.	Brailsford	said,	“The
whole	principle	came	from	the	idea	that	if	you	broke	down	everything
you	could	think	of	that	goes	into	riding	a	bike,	and	then	improve	it	by	1
percent,	you	will	get	a	significant	increase	when	you	put	them	all
together.”

Brailsford	and	his	coaches	began	by	making	small	adjustments	you

might	expect	from	a	professional	cycling	team.	They	redesigned	the
bike	seats	to	make	them	more	comfortable	and	rubbed	alcohol	on	the
tires	for	a	better	grip.	They	asked	riders	to	wear	electrically	heated
overshorts	to	maintain	ideal	muscle	temperature	while	riding	and	used

biofeedback	sensors	to	monitor	how	each	athlete	responded	to	a
particular	workout.	The	team	tested	various	fabrics	in	a	wind	tunnel
and	had	their	outdoor	riders	switch	to	indoor	racing	suits,	which
proved	to	be	lighter	and	more	aerodynamic.

But	they	didn’t	stop	there.	Brailsford	and	his	team	continued	to	find

1	percent	improvements	in	overlooked	and	unexpected	areas.	They
tested	different	types	of	massage	gels	to	see	which	one	led	to	the	fastest
muscle	recovery.	They	hired	a	surgeon	to	teach	each	rider	the	best	way
to	wash	their	hands	to	reduce	the	chances	of	catching	a	cold.	They
determined	the	type	of	pillow	and	mattress	that	led	to	the	best	night’s
sleep	for	each	rider.	They	even	painted	the	inside	of	the	team	truck
white,	which	helped	them	spot	little	bits	of	dust	that	would	normally
slip	by	unnoticed	but	could	degrade	the	performance	of	the	finely
tuned	bikes.

As	these	and	hundreds	of	other	small	improvements	accumulated,

the	results	came	faster	than	anyone	could	have	imagined.

Just	five	years	after	Brailsford	took	over,	the	British	Cycling	team

dominated	the	road	and	track	cycling	events	at	the	2008	Olympic
Games	in	Beijing,	where	they	won	an	astounding	60	percent	of	the
gold	medals	available.	Four	years	later,	when	the	Olympic	Games	came
to	London,	the	Brits	raised	the	bar	as	they	set	nine	Olympic	records
and	seven	world	records.

That	same	year,	Bradley	Wiggins	became	the	first	British	cyclist	to

win	the	Tour	de	France.	The	next	year,	his	teammate	Chris	Froome
won	the	race,	and	he	would	go	on	to	win	again	in	2015,	2016,	and	2017,
giving	the	British	team	five	Tour	de	France	victories	in	six	years.

During	the	ten-year	span	from	2007	to	2017,	British	cyclists	won
178	world	championships	and	sixty-six	Olympic	or	Paralympic	gold
medals	and	captured	five	Tour	de	France	victories	in	what	is	widely
regarded	as	the	most	successful	run	in	cycling	history.*

How	does	this	happen?	How	does	a	team	of	previously	ordinary
athletes	transform	into	world	champions	with	tiny	changes	that,	at
first	glance,	would	seem	to	make	a	modest	difference	at	best?	Why	do
small	improvements	accumulate	into	such	remarkable	results,	and
how	can	you	replicate	this	approach	in	your	own	life?

WHY	SMALL	HABITS	MAKE	A	BIG	DIFFERENCE

It	is	so	easy	to	overestimate	the	importance	of	one	defining	moment
and	underestimate	the	value	of	making	small	improvements	on	a	daily
basis.	Too	often,	we	convince	ourselves	that	massive	success	requires
massive	action.	Whether	it	is	losing	weight,	building	a	business,
writing	a	book,	winning	a	championship,	or	achieving	any	other	goal,
we	put	pressure	on	ourselves	to	make	some	earth-shattering
improvement	that	everyone	will	talk	about.

Meanwhile,	improving	by	1	percent	isn’t	particularly	notable—
sometimes	it	isn’t	even	noticeable—but	it	can	be	far	more	meaningful,
especially	in	the	long	run.	The	difference	a	tiny	improvement	can	make
over	time	is	astounding.	Here’s	how	the	math	works	out:	if	you	can	get
1	percent	better	each	day	for	one	year,	you’ll	end	up	thirty-seven	times
better	by	the	time	you’re	done.	Conversely,	if	you	get	1	percent	worse
each	day	for	one	year,	you’ll	decline	nearly	down	to	zero.	What	starts
as	a	small	win	or	a	minor	setback	accumulates	into	something	much
more.

1%	BETTER	EVERY	DAY

1%	worse	every	day	for	one	year.	0.99365	=	00.03

1%	better	every	day	for	one	year.	1.01365	=	37.78

FIGURE	1:	The	effects	of	small	habits	compound	over	time.	For	example,	if
you	can	get	just	1	percent	better	each	day,	you’ll	end	up	with	results	that	are
nearly	37	times	better	after	one	year.

Habits	are	the	compound	interest	of	self-improvement.	The	same
way	that	money	multiplies	through	compound	interest,	the	effects	of
your	habits	multiply	as	you	repeat	them.	They	seem	to	make	little
difference	on	any	given	day	and	yet	the	impact	they	deliver	over	the
months	and	years	can	be	enormous.	It	is	only	when	looking	back	two,
five,	or	perhaps	ten	years	later	that	the	value	of	good	habits	and	the
cost	of	bad	ones	becomes	strikingly	apparent.

This	can	be	a	difficult	concept	to	appreciate	in	daily	life.	We	often
dismiss	small	changes	because	they	don’t	seem	to	matter	very	much	in
the	moment.	If	you	save	a	little	money	now,	you’re	still	not	a
millionaire.	If	you	go	to	the	gym	three	days	in	a	row,	you’re	still	out	of
shape.	If	you	study	Mandarin	for	an	hour	tonight,	you	still	haven’t
learned	the	language.	We	make	a	few	changes,	but	the	results	never
seem	to	come	quickly	and	so	we	slide	back	into	our	previous	routines.

Unfortunately,	the	slow	pace	of	transformation	also	makes	it	easy	to

let	a	bad	habit	slide.	If	you	eat	an	unhealthy	meal	today,	the	scale
doesn’t	move	much.	If	you	work	late	tonight	and	ignore	your	family,

they	will	forgive	you.	If	you	procrastinate	and	put	your	project	off	until
tomorrow,	there	will	usually	be	time	to	finish	it	later.	A	single	decision
is	easy	to	dismiss.

But	when	we	repeat	1	percent	errors,	day	after	day,	by	replicating

poor	decisions,	duplicating	tiny	mistakes,	and	rationalizing	little
excuses,	our	small	choices	compound	into	toxic	results.	It’s	the
accumulation	of	many	missteps—a	1	percent	decline	here	and	there—
that	eventually	leads	to	a	problem.

The	impact	created	by	a	change	in	your	habits	is	similar	to	the	effect

of	shifting	the	route	of	an	airplane	by	just	a	few	degrees.	Imagine	you
are	flying	from	Los	Angeles	to	New	York	City.	If	a	pilot	leaving	from
LAX	adjusts	the	heading	just	3.5	degrees	south,	you	will	land	in
Washington,	D.C.,	instead	of	New	York.	Such	a	small	change	is	barely
noticeable	at	takeoff—the	nose	of	the	airplane	moves	just	a	few	feet—
but	when	magnified	across	the	entire	United	States,	you	end	up
hundreds	of	miles	apart.*

Similarly,	a	slight	change	in	your	daily	habits	can	guide	your	life	to	a
very	different	destination.	Making	a	choice	that	is	1	percent	better	or	1
percent	worse	seems	insignificant	in	the	moment,	but	over	the	span	of
moments	that	make	up	a	lifetime	these	choices	determine	the
difference	between	who	you	are	and	who	you	could	be.	Success	is	the
product	of	daily	habits—not	once-in-a-lifetime	transformations.

That	said,	it	doesn’t	matter	how	successful	or	unsuccessful	you	are
right	now.	What	matters	is	whether	your	habits	are	putting	you	on	the
path	toward	success.	You	should	be	far	more	concerned	with	your
current	trajectory	than	with	your	current	results.	If	you’re	a	millionaire
but	you	spend	more	than	you	earn	each	month,	then	you’re	on	a	bad
trajectory.	If	your	spending	habits	don’t	change,	it’s	not	going	to	end
well.	Conversely,	if	you’re	broke,	but	you	save	a	little	bit	every	month,
then	you’re	on	the	path	toward	financial	freedom—even	if	you’re
moving	slower	than	you’d	like.

Your	outcomes	are	a	lagging	measure	of	your	habits.	Your	net	worth

is	a	lagging	measure	of	your	financial	habits.	Your	weight	is	a	lagging
measure	of	your	eating	habits.	Your	knowledge	is	a	lagging	measure	of
your	learning	habits.	Your	clutter	is	a	lagging	measure	of	your	cleaning
habits.	You	get	what	you	repeat.

If	you	want	to	predict	where	you’ll	end	up	in	life,	all	you	have	to	do
is	follow	the	curve	of	tiny	gains	or	tiny	losses,	and	see	how	your	daily
choices	will	compound	ten	or	twenty	years	down	the	line.	Are	you
spending	less	than	you	earn	each	month?	Are	you	making	it	into	the
gym	each	week?	Are	you	reading	books	and	learning	something	new
each	day?	Tiny	battles	like	these	are	the	ones	that	will	define	your
future	self.

Time	magnifies	the	margin	between	success	and	failure.	It	will
multiply	whatever	you	feed	it.	Good	habits	make	time	your	ally.	Bad
habits	make	time	your	enemy.

Habits	are	a	double-edged	sword.	Bad	habits	can	cut	you	down	just
as	easily	as	good	habits	can	build	you	up,	which	is	why	understanding
the	details	is	crucial.	You	need	to	know	how	habits	work	and	how	to
design	them	to	your	liking,	so	you	can	avoid	the	dangerous	half	of	the
blade.

YOUR	HABITS	CAN	COMPOUND	FOR	YOU	OR	AGAINST	YOU

Positive	Compounding

Productivity	compounds.	Accomplishing	one	extra	task	is	a	small	feat	on	any	given	day,
but	it	counts	for	a	lot	over	an	entire	career.	The	effect	of	automating	an	old	task	or	mastering
a	new	skill	can	be	even	greater.	The	more	tasks	you	can	handle	without	thinking,	the	more
your	brain	is	free	to	focus	on	other	areas.

Knowledge	compounds.	Learning	one	new	idea	won’t	make	you	a	genius,	but	a
commitment	to	lifelong	learning	can	be	transformative.	Furthermore,	each	book	you	read	not
only	teaches	you	something	new	but	also	opens	up	different	ways	of	thinking	about	old
ideas.	As	Warren	Buffett	says,	“That’s	how	knowledge	works.	It	builds	up,	like	compound
interest.”

Relationships	compound.	People	reflect	your	behavior	back	to	you.	The	more	you	help
others,	the	more	others	want	to	help	you.	Being	a	little	bit	nicer	in	each	interaction	can	result
in	a	network	of	broad	and	strong	connections	over	time.

Negative	Compounding

Stress	compounds.	The	frustration	of	a	traffic	jam.	The	weight	of	parenting	responsibilities.
The	worry	of	making	ends	meet.	The	strain	of	slightly	high	blood	pressure.	By	themselves,
these	common	causes	of	stress	are	manageable.	But	when	they	persist	for	years,	little
stresses	compound	into	serious	health	issues.

Negative	thoughts	compound.	The	more	you	think	of	yourself	as	worthless,	stupid,	or	ugly,
the	more	you	condition	yourself	to	interpret	life	that	way.	You	get	trapped	in	a	thought	loop.
The	same	is	true	for	how	you	think	about	others.	Once	you	fall	into	the	habit	of	seeing	people
as	angry,	unjust,	or	selfish,	you	see	those	kind	of	people	everywhere.

Outrage	compounds.	Riots,	protests,	and	mass	movements	are	rarely	the	result	of	a	single
event.	Instead,	a	long	series	of	microaggressions	and	daily	aggravations	slowly	multiply	until
one	event	tips	the	scales	and	outrage	spreads	like	wildfire.

WHAT	PROGRESS	IS	REALLY	LIKE

Imagine	that	you	have	an	ice	cube	sitting	on	the	table	in	front	of	you.
The	room	is	cold	and	you	can	see	your	breath.	It	is	currently	twenty-
five	degrees.	Ever	so	slowly,	the	room	begins	to	heat	up.

Twenty-six	degrees.

Twenty-seven.

Twenty-eight.

The	ice	cube	is	still	sitting	on	the	table	in	front	of	you.

Twenty-nine	degrees.

Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Still,	nothing	has	happened.

Then,	thirty-two	degrees.	The	ice	begins	to	melt.	A	one-degree	shift,

seemingly	no	different	from	the	temperature	increases	before	it,	has
unlocked	a	huge	change.

Breakthrough	moments	are	often	the	result	of	many	previous
actions,	which	build	up	the	potential	required	to	unleash	a	major
change.	This	pattern	shows	up	everywhere.	Cancer	spends	80	percent
of	its	life	undetectable,	then	takes	over	the	body	in	months.	Bamboo
can	barely	be	seen	for	the	first	five	years	as	it	builds	extensive	root
systems	underground	before	exploding	ninety	feet	into	the	air	within
six	weeks.

Similarly,	habits	often	appear	to	make	no	difference	until	you	cross
a	critical	threshold	and	unlock	a	new	level	of	performance.	In	the	early
and	middle	stages	of	any	quest,	there	is	often	a	Valley	of
Disappointment.	You	expect	to	make	progress	in	a	linear	fashion	and
it’s	frustrating	how	ineffective	changes	can	seem	during	the	first	days,
weeks,	and	even	months.	It	doesn’t	feel	like	you	are	going	anywhere.
It’s	a	hallmark	of	any	compounding	process:	the	most	powerful
outcomes	are	delayed.

This	is	one	of	the	core	reasons	why	it	is	so	hard	to	build	habits	that
last.	People	make	a	few	small	changes,	fail	to	see	a	tangible	result,	and
decide	to	stop.	You	think,	“I’ve	been	running	every	day	for	a	month,	so
why	can’t	I	see	any	change	in	my	body?”	Once	this	kind	of	thinking

takes	over,	it’s	easy	to	let	good	habits	fall	by	the	wayside.	But	in	order
to	make	a	meaningful	difference,	habits	need	to	persist	long	enough	to
break	through	this	plateau—what	I	call	the	Plateau	of	Latent	Potential.

If	you	find	yourself	struggling	to	build	a	good	habit	or	break	a	bad
one,	it	is	not	because	you	have	lost	your	ability	to	improve.	It	is	often
because	you	have	not	yet	crossed	the	Plateau	of	Latent	Potential.
Complaining	about	not	achieving	success	despite	working	hard	is	like
complaining	about	an	ice	cube	not	melting	when	you	heated	it	from
twenty-five	to	thirty-one	degrees.	Your	work	was	not	wasted;	it	is	just
being	stored.	All	the	action	happens	at	thirty-two	degrees.

When	you	finally	break	through	the	Plateau	of	Latent	Potential,
people	will	call	it	an	overnight	success.	The	outside	world	only	sees	the
most	dramatic	event	rather	than	all	that	preceded	it.	But	you	know	that
it’s	the	work	you	did	long	ago—when	it	seemed	that	you	weren’t
making	any	progress—that	makes	the	jump	today	possible.

It	is	the	human	equivalent	of	geological	pressure.	Two	tectonic
plates	can	grind	against	one	another	for	millions	of	years,	the	tension
slowly	building	all	the	while.	Then,	one	day,	they	rub	each	other	once
again,	in	the	same	fashion	they	have	for	ages,	but	this	time	the	tension
is	too	great.	An	earthquake	erupts.	Change	can	take	years—before	it
happens	all	at	once.

Mastery	requires	patience.	The	San	Antonio	Spurs,	one	of	the	most

successful	teams	in	NBA	history,	have	a	quote	from	social	reformer
Jacob	Riis	hanging	in	their	locker	room:	“When	nothing	seems	to	help,
I	go	and	look	at	a	stonecutter	hammering	away	at	his	rock,	perhaps	a
hundred	times	without	as	much	as	a	crack	showing	in	it.	Yet	at	the
hundred	and	first	blow	it	will	split	in	two,	and	I	know	it	was	not	that
last	blow	that	did	it—but	all	that	had	gone	before.”

THE	PLATEAU	OF	LATENT	POTENTIAL

FIGURE	2:	We	often	expect	progress	to	be	linear.	At	the	very	least,	we	hope
it	will	come	quickly.	In	reality,	the	results	of	our	efforts	are	often	delayed.	It	is
not	until	months	or	years	later	that	we	realize	the	true	value	of	the	previous
work	we	have	done.	This	can	result	in	a	“valley	of	disappointment”	where
people	feel	discouraged	after	putting	in	weeks	or	months	of	hard	work
without	experiencing	any	results.	However,	this	work	was	not	wasted.	It	was
simply	being	stored.	It	is	not	until	much	later	that	the	full	value	of	previous
efforts	is	revealed.

All	big	things	come	from	small	beginnings.	The	seed	of	every	habit

is	a	single,	tiny	decision.	But	as	that	decision	is	repeated,	a	habit
sprouts	and	grows	stronger.	Roots	entrench	themselves	and	branches
grow.	The	task	of	breaking	a	bad	habit	is	like	uprooting	a	powerful	oak
within	us.	And	the	task	of	building	a	good	habit	is	like	cultivating	a
delicate	flower	one	day	at	a	time.

But	what	determines	whether	we	stick	with	a	habit	long	enough	to
survive	the	Plateau	of	Latent	Potential	and	break	through	to	the	other
side?	What	is	it	that	causes	some	people	to	slide	into	unwanted	habits
and	enables	others	to	enjoy	the	compounding	effects	of	good	ones?

FORGET	ABOUT	GOALS,	FOCUS	ON	SYSTEMS	INSTEAD

Prevailing	wisdom	claims	that	the	best	way	to	achieve	what	we	want	in
life—getting	into	better	shape,	building	a	successful	business,	relaxing
more	and	worrying	less,	spending	more	time	with	friends	and	family—
is	to	set	specific,	actionable	goals.

For	many	years,	this	was	how	I	approached	my	habits,	too.	Each	one

was	a	goal	to	be	reached.	I	set	goals	for	the	grades	I	wanted	to	get	in
school,	for	the	weights	I	wanted	to	lift	in	the	gym,	for	the	profits	I
wanted	to	earn	in	business.	I	succeeded	at	a	few,	but	I	failed	at	a	lot	of
them.	Eventually,	I	began	to	realize	that	my	results	had	very	little	to	do
with	the	goals	I	set	and	nearly	everything	to	do	with	the	systems	I
followed.

What’s	the	difference	between	systems	and	goals?	It’s	a	distinction	I

first	learned	from	Scott	Adams,	the	cartoonist	behind	the	Dilbert
comic.	Goals	are	about	the	results	you	want	to	achieve.	Systems	are
about	the	processes	that	lead	to	those	results.

If	you’re	a	coach,	your	goal	might	be	to	win	a	championship.	Your
system	is	the	way	you	recruit	players,	manage	your	assistant
coaches,	and	conduct	practice.

If	you’re	an	entrepreneur,	your	goal	might	be	to	build	a	million-
dollar	business.	Your	system	is	how	you	test	product	ideas,	hire
employees,	and	run	marketing	campaigns.

If	you’re	a	musician,	your	goal	might	be	to	play	a	new	piece.	Your
system	is	how	often	you	practice,	how	you	break	down	and	tackle
difficult	measures,	and	your	method	for	receiving	feedback	from
your	instructor.

Now	for	the	interesting	question:	If	you	completely	ignored	your
goals	and	focused	only	on	your	system,	would	you	still	succeed?	For
example,	if	you	were	a	basketball	coach	and	you	ignored	your	goal	to
win	a	championship	and	focused	only	on	what	your	team	does	at
practice	each	day,	would	you	still	get	results?

I	think	you	would.

The	goal	in	any	sport	is	to	finish	with	the	best	score,	but	it	would	be
ridiculous	to	spend	the	whole	game	staring	at	the	scoreboard.	The	only
way	to	actually	win	is	to	get	better	each	day.	In	the	words	of	three-time
Super	Bowl	winner	Bill	Walsh,	“The	score	takes	care	of	itself.”	The
same	is	true	for	other	areas	of	life.	If	you	want	better	results,	then
forget	about	setting	goals.	Focus	on	your	system	instead.

What	do	I	mean	by	this?	Are	goals	completely	useless?	Of	course
not.	Goals	are	good	for	setting	a	direction,	but	systems	are	best	for

making	progress.	A	handful	of	problems	arise	when	you	spend	too
much	time	thinking	about	your	goals	and	not	enough	time	designing
your	systems.

Problem	#1:	Winners	and	losers	have	the	same	goals.

Goal	setting	suffers	from	a	serious	case	of	survivorship	bias.	We
concentrate	on	the	people	who	end	up	winning—the	survivors—and
mistakenly	assume	that	ambitious	goals	led	to	their	success	while
overlooking	all	of	the	people	who	had	the	same	objective	but	didn’t
succeed.

Every	Olympian	wants	to	win	a	gold	medal.	Every	candidate	wants

to	get	the	job.	And	if	successful	and	unsuccessful	people	share	the
same	goals,	then	the	goal	cannot	be	what	differentiates	the	winners
from	the	losers.	It	wasn’t	the	goal	of	winning	the	Tour	de	France	that
propelled	the	British	cyclists	to	the	top	of	the	sport.	Presumably,	they
had	wanted	to	win	the	race	every	year	before—just	like	every	other
professional	team.	The	goal	had	always	been	there.	It	was	only	when
they	implemented	a	system	of	continuous	small	improvements	that
they	achieved	a	different	outcome.

Problem	#2:	Achieving	a	goal	is	only	a	momentary	change.

Imagine	you	have	a	messy	room	and	you	set	a	goal	to	clean	it.	If	you
summon	the	energy	to	tidy	up,	then	you	will	have	a	clean	room—for
now.	But	if	you	maintain	the	same	sloppy,	pack-rat	habits	that	led	to	a
messy	room	in	the	first	place,	soon	you’ll	be	looking	at	a	new	pile	of
clutter	and	hoping	for	another	burst	of	motivation.	You’re	left	chasing
the	same	outcome	because	you	never	changed	the	system	behind	it.
You	treated	a	symptom	without	addressing	the	cause.

Achieving	a	goal	only	changes	your	life	for	the	moment.	That’s	the

counterintuitive	thing	about	improvement.	We	think	we	need	to
change	our	results,	but	the	results	are	not	the	problem.	What	we	really
need	to	change	are	the	systems	that	cause	those	results.	When	you
solve	problems	at	the	results	level,	you	only	solve	them	temporarily.	In
order	to	improve	for	good,	you	need	to	solve	problems	at	the	systems
level.	Fix	the	inputs	and	the	outputs	will	fix	themselves.

Problem	#3:	Goals	restrict	your	happiness.

The	implicit	assumption	behind	any	goal	is	this:	“Once	I	reach	my	goal,
then	I’ll	be	happy.”	The	problem	with	a	goals-first	mentality	is	that
you’re	continually	putting	happiness	off	until	the	next	milestone.	I’ve
slipped	into	this	trap	so	many	times	I’ve	lost	count.	For	years,
happiness	was	always	something	for	my	future	self	to	enjoy.	I
promised	myself	that	once	I	gained	twenty	pounds	of	muscle	or	after
my	business	was	featured	in	the	New	York	Times,	then	I	could	finally
relax.

Furthermore,	goals	create	an	“either-or”	conflict:	either	you	achieve
your	goal	and	are	successful	or	you	fail	and	you	are	a	disappointment.
You	mentally	box	yourself	into	a	narrow	version	of	happiness.	This	is
misguided.	It	is	unlikely	that	your	actual	path	through	life	will	match
the	exact	journey	you	had	in	mind	when	you	set	out.	It	makes	no	sense
to	restrict	your	satisfaction	to	one	scenario	when	there	are	many	paths
to	success.

A	systems-first	mentality	provides	the	antidote.	When	you	fall	in
love	with	the	process	rather	than	the	product,	you	don’t	have	to	wait	to
give	yourself	permission	to	be	happy.	You	can	be	satisfied	anytime
your	system	is	running.	And	a	system	can	be	successful	in	many
different	forms,	not	just	the	one	you	first	envision.

Problem	#4:	Goals	are	at	odds	with	long-term	progress.

Finally,	a	goal-oriented	mind-set	can	create	a	“yo-yo”	effect.	Many
runners	work	hard	for	months,	but	as	soon	as	they	cross	the	finish	line,
they	stop	training.	The	race	is	no	longer	there	to	motivate	them.	When
all	of	your	hard	work	is	focused	on	a	particular	goal,	what	is	left	to
push	you	forward	after	you	achieve	it?	This	is	why	many	people	find
themselves	reverting	to	their	old	habits	after	accomplishing	a	goal.

The	purpose	of	setting	goals	is	to	win	the	game.	The	purpose	of
building	systems	is	to	continue	playing	the	game.	True	long-term
thinking	is	goal-less	thinking.	It’s	not	about	any	single
accomplishment.	It	is	about	the	cycle	of	endless	refinement	and
continuous	improvement.	Ultimately,	it	is	your	commitment	to	the
process	that	will	determine	your	progress.

A	SYSTEM	OF	ATOMIC	HABITS

If	you’re	having	trouble	changing	your	habits,	the	problem	isn’t	you.
The	problem	is	your	system.	Bad	habits	repeat	themselves	again	and
again	not	because	you	don’t	want	to	change,	but	because	you	have	the
wrong	system	for	change.

You	do	not	rise	to	the	level	of	your	goals.	You	fall	to	the	level	of	your

systems.

Focusing	on	the	overall	system,	rather	than	a	single	goal,	is	one	of

the	core	themes	of	this	book.	It	is	also	one	of	the	deeper	meanings
behind	the	word	atomic.	By	now,	you’ve	probably	realized	that	an
atomic	habit	refers	to	a	tiny	change,	a	marginal	gain,	a	1	percent
improvement.	But	atomic	habits	are	not	just	any	old	habits,	however
small.	They	are	little	habits	that	are	part	of	a	larger	system.	Just	as
atoms	are	the	building	blocks	of	molecules,	atomic	habits	are	the
building	blocks	of	remarkable	results.

Habits	are	like	the	atoms	of	our	lives.	Each	one	is	a	fundamental
unit	that	contributes	to	your	overall	improvement.	At	first,	these	tiny
routines	seem	insignificant,	but	soon	they	build	on	each	other	and	fuel
bigger	wins	that	multiply	to	a	degree	that	far	outweighs	the	cost	of
their	initial	investment.	They	are	both	small	and	mighty.	This	is	the
meaning	of	the	phrase	atomic	habits—a	regular	practice	or	routine
that	is	not	only	small	and	easy	to	do,	but	also	the	source	of	incredible
power;	a	component	of	the	system	of	compound	growth.

Chapter	Summary

Habits	are	the	compound	interest	of	self-improvement.	Getting	1
percent	better	every	day	counts	for	a	lot	in	the	long-run.

Habits	are	a	double-edged	sword.	They	can	work	for	you	or
against	you,	which	is	why	understanding	the	details	is	essential.

Small	changes	often	appear	to	make	no	difference	until	you	cross
a	critical	threshold.	The	most	powerful	outcomes	of	any
compounding	process	are	delayed.	You	need	to	be	patient.

An	atomic	habit	is	a	little	habit	that	is	part	of	a	larger	system.	Just
as	atoms	are	the	building	blocks	of	molecules,	atomic	habits	are
the	building	blocks	of	remarkable	results.

If	you	want	better	results,	then	forget	about	setting	goals.	Focus
on	your	system	instead.

You	do	not	rise	to	the	level	of	your	goals.	You	fall	to	the	level	of
your	systems.

2

How	Your	Habits	Shape	Your	Identity	(and
Vice	Versa)

W

HY	IS	IT	so	easy	to	repeat	bad	habits	and	so	hard	to	form	good
ones?	Few	things	can	have	a	more	powerful	impact	on	your	life

than	improving	your	daily	habits.	And	yet	it	is	likely	that	this	time	next
year	you’ll	be	doing	the	same	thing	rather	than	something	better.

It	often	feels	difficult	to	keep	good	habits	going	for	more	than	a	few

days,	even	with	sincere	effort	and	the	occasional	burst	of	motivation.
Habits	like	exercise,	meditation,	journaling,	and	cooking	are
reasonable	for	a	day	or	two	and	then	become	a	hassle.

However,	once	your	habits	are	established,	they	seem	to	stick
around	forever—especially	the	unwanted	ones.	Despite	our	best
intentions,	unhealthy	habits	like	eating	junk	food,	watching	too	much
television,	procrastinating,	and	smoking	can	feel	impossible	to	break.

Changing	our	habits	is	challenging	for	two	reasons:	(1)	we	try	to

change	the	wrong	thing	and	(2)	we	try	to	change	our	habits	in	the
wrong	way.	In	this	chapter,	I’ll	address	the	first	point.	In	the	chapters
that	follow,	I’ll	answer	the	second.

Our	first	mistake	is	that	we	try	to	change	the	wrong	thing.	To

understand	what	I	mean,	consider	that	there	are	three	levels	at	which
change	can	occur.	You	can	imagine	them	like	the	layers	of	an	onion.

THREE	LAYERS	OF	BEHAVIOR	CHANGE

FIGURE	3:	There	are	three	layers	of	behavior	change:	a	change	in	your
outcomes,	a	change	in	your	processes,	or	a	change	in	your	identity.

The	first	layer	is	changing	your	outcomes.	This	level	is
concerned	with	changing	your	results:	losing	weight,	publishing	a
book,	winning	a	championship.	Most	of	the	goals	you	set	are
associated	with	this	level	of	change.

The	second	layer	is	changing	your	process.	This	level	is
concerned	with	changing	your	habits	and	systems:	implementing	a
new	routine	at	the	gym,	decluttering	your	desk	for	better	workflow,
developing	a	meditation	practice.	Most	of	the	habits	you	build	are
associated	with	this	level.

The	third	and	deepest	layer	is	changing	your	identity.	This

level	is	concerned	with	changing	your	beliefs:	your	worldview,	your
self-image,	your	judgments	about	yourself	and	others.	Most	of	the
beliefs,	assumptions,	and	biases	you	hold	are	associated	with	this	level.

Outcomes	are	about	what	you	get.	Processes	are	about	what	you	do.

Identity	is	about	what	you	believe.	When	it	comes	to	building	habits
that	last—when	it	comes	to	building	a	system	of	1	percent
improvements—the	problem	is	not	that	one	level	is	“better”	or	“worse”
than	another.	All	levels	of	change	are	useful	in	their	own	way.	The
problem	is	the	direction	of	change.

Many	people	begin	the	process	of	changing	their	habits	by	focusing
on	what	they	want	to	achieve.	This	leads	us	to	outcome-based	habits.
The	alternative	is	to	build	identity-based	habits.	With	this	approach,
we	start	by	focusing	on	who	we	wish	to	become.

OUTCOME-BASED	HABITS

IDENTITY-BASED	HABITS

FIGURE	4:	With	outcome-based	habits,	the	focus	is	on	what	you	want	to
achieve.	With	identity-based	habits,	the	focus	is	on	who	you	wish	to
become.

Imagine	two	people	resisting	a	cigarette.	When	offered	a	smoke,	the

first	person	says,	“No	thanks.	I’m	trying	to	quit.”	It	sounds	like	a
reasonable	response,	but	this	person	still	believes	they	are	a	smoker
who	is	trying	to	be	something	else.	They	are	hoping	their	behavior	will
change	while	carrying	around	the	same	beliefs.

The	second	person	declines	by	saying,	“No	thanks.	I’m	not	a
smoker.”	It’s	a	small	difference,	but	this	statement	signals	a	shift	in
identity.	Smoking	was	part	of	their	former	life,	not	their	current	one.
They	no	longer	identify	as	someone	who	smokes.

Most	people	don’t	even	consider	identity	change	when	they	set	out

to	improve.	They	just	think,	“I	want	to	be	skinny	(outcome)	and	if	I
stick	to	this	diet,	then	I’ll	be	skinny	(process).”	They	set	goals	and
determine	the	actions	they	should	take	to	achieve	those	goals	without
considering	the	beliefs	that	drive	their	actions.	They	never	shift	the

way	they	look	at	themselves,	and	they	don’t	realize	that	their	old
identity	can	sabotage	their	new	plans	for	change.

Behind	every	system	of	actions	are	a	system	of	beliefs.	The	system	of

a	democracy	is	founded	on	beliefs	like	freedom,	majority	rule,	and
social	equality.	The	system	of	a	dictatorship	has	a	very	different	set	of
beliefs	like	absolute	authority	and	strict	obedience.	You	can	imagine
many	ways	to	try	to	get	more	people	to	vote	in	a	democracy,	but	such
behavior	change	would	never	get	off	the	ground	in	a	dictatorship.
That’s	not	the	identity	of	the	system.	Voting	is	a	behavior	that	is
impossible	under	a	certain	set	of	beliefs.

A	similar	pattern	exists	whether	we	are	discussing	individuals,
organizations,	or	societies.	There	are	a	set	of	beliefs	and	assumptions
that	shape	the	system,	an	identity	behind	the	habits.

Behavior	that	is	incongruent	with	the	self	will	not	last.	You	may

want	more	money,	but	if	your	identity	is	someone	who	consumes
rather	than	creates,	then	you’ll	continue	to	be	pulled	toward	spending
rather	than	earning.	You	may	want	better	health,	but	if	you	continue	to
prioritize	comfort	over	accomplishment,	you’ll	be	drawn	to	relaxing
rather	than	training.	It’s	hard	to	change	your	habits	if	you	never
change	the	underlying	beliefs	that	led	to	your	past	behavior.	You	have
a	new	goal	and	a	new	plan,	but	you	haven’t	changed	who	you	are.

The	story	of	Brian	Clark,	an	entrepreneur	from	Boulder,	Colorado,
provides	a	good	example.	“For	as	long	as	I	can	remember,	I’ve	chewed
my	fingernails,”	Clark	told	me.	“It	started	as	a	nervous	habit	when	I
was	young,	and	then	morphed	into	an	undesirable	grooming	ritual.
One	day,	I	resolved	to	stop	chewing	my	nails	until	they	grew	out	a	bit.
Through	mindful	willpower	alone,	I	managed	to	do	it.”

Then,	Clark	did	something	surprising.

“I	asked	my	wife	to	schedule	my	first-ever	manicure,”	he	said.	“My

thought	was	that	if	I	started	paying	to	maintain	my	nails,	I	wouldn’t
chew	them.	And	it	worked,	but	not	for	the	monetary	reason.	What
happened	was	the	manicure	made	my	fingers	look	really	nice	for	the
first	time.	The	manicurist	even	said	that—other	than	the	chewing—I
had	really	healthy,	attractive	nails.	Suddenly,	I	was	proud	of	my
fingernails.	And	even	though	that’s	something	I	had	never	aspired	to,	it
made	all	the	difference.	I’ve	never	chewed	my	nails	since;	not	even	a

single	close	call.	And	it’s	because	I	now	take	pride	in	properly	caring
for	them.”

The	ultimate	form	of	intrinsic	motivation	is	when	a	habit	becomes
part	of	your	identity.	It’s	one	thing	to	say	I’m	the	type	of	person	who
wants	this.	It’s	something	very	different	to	say	I’m	the	type	of	person
who	is	this.

The	more	pride	you	have	in	a	particular	aspect	of	your	identity,	the
more	motivated	you	will	be	to	maintain	the	habits	associated	with	it.	If
you’re	proud	of	how	your	hair	looks,	you’ll	develop	all	sorts	of	habits	to
care	for	and	maintain	it.	If	you’re	proud	of	the	size	of	your	biceps,
you’ll	make	sure	you	never	skip	an	upper-body	workout.	If	you’re
proud	of	the	scarves	you	knit,	you’ll	be	more	likely	to	spend	hours
knitting	each	week.	Once	your	pride	gets	involved,	you’ll	fight	tooth
and	nail	to	maintain	your	habits.

True	behavior	change	is	identity	change.	You	might	start	a	habit
because	of	motivation,	but	the	only	reason	you’ll	stick	with	one	is	that
it	becomes	part	of	your	identity.	Anyone	can	convince	themselves	to
visit	the	gym	or	eat	healthy	once	or	twice,	but	if	you	don’t	shift	the
belief	behind	the	behavior,	then	it	is	hard	to	stick	with	long-term
changes.	Improvements	are	only	temporary	until	they	become	part	of
who	you	are.

The	goal	is	not	to	read	a	book,	the	goal	is	to	become	a	reader.

The	goal	is	not	to	run	a	marathon,	the	goal	is	to	become	a	runner.

The	goal	is	not	to	learn	an	instrument,	the	goal	is	to	become	a
musician.

Your	behaviors	are	usually	a	reflection	of	your	identity.	What	you	do

is	an	indication	of	the	type	of	person	you	believe	that	you	are—either
consciously	or	nonconsciously.*	Research	has	shown	that	once	a
person	believes	in	a	particular	aspect	of	their	identity,	they	are	more
likely	to	act	in	alignment	with	that	belief.	For	example,	people	who
identified	as	“being	a	voter”	were	more	likely	to	vote	than	those	who
simply	claimed	“voting”	was	an	action	they	wanted	to	perform.
Similarly,	the	person	who	incorporates	exercise	into	their	identity
doesn’t	have	to	convince	themselves	to	train.	Doing	the	right	thing	is
easy.	After	all,	when	your	behavior	and	your	identity	are	fully	aligned,

you	are	no	longer	pursuing	behavior	change.	You	are	simply	acting	like
the	type	of	person	you	already	believe	yourself	to	be.

Like	all	aspects	of	habit	formation,	this,	too,	is	a	double-edged
sword.	When	working	for	you,	identity	change	can	be	a	powerful	force
for	self-improvement.	When	working	against	you,	though,	identity
change	can	be	a	curse.	Once	you	have	adopted	an	identity,	it	can	be
easy	to	let	your	allegiance	to	it	impact	your	ability	to	change.	Many
people	walk	through	life	in	a	cognitive	slumber,	blindly	following	the
norms	attached	to	their	identity.

“I’m	terrible	with	directions.”

“I’m	not	a	morning	person.”

“I’m	bad	at	remembering	people’s	names.”

“I’m	always	late.”

“I’m	not	good	with	technology.”

“I’m	horrible	at	math.”

.	.	.	and	a	thousand	other	variations.

When	you	have	repeated	a	story	to	yourself	for	years,	it	is	easy	to
slide	into	these	mental	grooves	and	accept	them	as	a	fact.	In	time,	you
begin	to	resist	certain	actions	because	“that’s	not	who	I	am.”	There	is
internal	pressure	to	maintain	your	self-image	and	behave	in	a	way	that
is	consistent	with	your	beliefs.	You	find	whatever	way	you	can	to	avoid
contradicting	yourself.

The	more	deeply	a	thought	or	action	is	tied	to	your	identity,	the
more	difficult	it	is	to	change	it.	It	can	feel	comfortable	to	believe	what
your	culture	believes	(group	identity)	or	to	do	what	upholds	your	self-
image	(personal	identity),	even	if	it’s	wrong.	The	biggest	barrier	to
positive	change	at	any	level—individual,	team,	society—is	identity
conflict.	Good	habits	can	make	rational	sense,	but	if	they	conflict	with
your	identity,	you	will	fail	to	put	them	into	action.

On	any	given	day,	you	may	struggle	with	your	habits	because	you’re
too	busy	or	too	tired	or	too	overwhelmed	or	hundreds	of	other	reasons.
Over	the	long	run,	however,	the	real	reason	you	fail	to	stick	with	habits
is	that	your	self-image	gets	in	the	way.	This	is	why	you	can’t	get	too
attached	to	one	version	of	your	identity.	Progress	requires	unlearning.

Becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself	requires	you	to	continuously	edit
your	beliefs,	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your	identity.

This	brings	us	to	an	important	question:	If	your	beliefs	and

worldview	play	such	an	important	role	in	your	behavior,	where	do	they
come	from	in	the	first	place?	How,	exactly,	is	your	identity	formed?
And	how	can	you	emphasize	new	aspects	of	your	identity	that	serve
you	and	gradually	erase	the	pieces	that	hinder	you?

THE	TWO-STEP	PROCESS	TO	CHANGING	YOUR	IDENTITY

Your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits.	You	are	not	born	with	preset
beliefs.	Every	belief,	including	those	about	yourself,	is	learned	and
conditioned	through	experience.*

More	precisely,	your	habits	are	how	you	embody	your	identity.
When	you	make	your	bed	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity	of	an
organized	person.	When	you	write	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity
of	a	creative	person.	When	you	train	each	day,	you	embody	the	identity
of	an	athletic	person.

The	more	you	repeat	a	behavior,	the	more	you	reinforce	the	identity
associated	with	that	behavior.	In	fact,	the	word	identity	was	originally
derived	from	the	Latin	words	essentitas,	which	means	being,	and
identidem,	which	means	repeatedly.	Your	identity	is	literally	your
“repeated	beingness.”

Whatever	your	identity	is	right	now,	you	only	believe	it	because	you
have	proof	of	it.	If	you	go	to	church	every	Sunday	for	twenty	years,	you
have	evidence	that	you	are	religious.	If	you	study	biology	for	one	hour
every	night,	you	have	evidence	that	you	are	studious.	If	you	go	to	the
gym	even	when	it’s	snowing,	you	have	evidence	that	you	are	committed
to	fitness.	The	more	evidence	you	have	for	a	belief,	the	more	strongly
you	will	believe	it.

For	most	of	my	early	life,	I	didn’t	consider	myself	a	writer.	If	you
were	to	ask	any	of	my	high	school	teachers	or	college	professors,	they
would	tell	you	I	was	an	average	writer	at	best:	certainly	not	a	standout.
When	I	began	my	writing	career,	I	published	a	new	article	every
Monday	and	Thursday	for	the	first	few	years.	As	the	evidence	grew,	so
did	my	identity	as	a	writer.	I	didn’t	start	out	as	a	writer.	I	became	one
through	my	habits.

Of	course,	your	habits	are	not	the	only	actions	that	influence	your

identity,	but	by	virtue	of	their	frequency	they	are	usually	the	most
important	ones.	Each	experience	in	life	modifies	your	self-image,	but
it’s	unlikely	you	would	consider	yourself	a	soccer	player	because	you
kicked	a	ball	once	or	an	artist	because	you	scribbled	a	picture.	As	you
repeat	these	actions,	however,	the	evidence	accumulates	and	your	self-
image	begins	to	change.	The	effect	of	one-off	experiences	tends	to	fade
away	while	the	effect	of	habits	gets	reinforced	with	time,	which	means
your	habits	contribute	most	of	the	evidence	that	shapes	your	identity.
In	this	way,	the	process	of	building	habits	is	actually	the	process	of
becoming	yourself.

This	is	a	gradual	evolution.	We	do	not	change	by	snapping	our

fingers	and	deciding	to	be	someone	entirely	new.	We	change	bit	by	bit,
day	by	day,	habit	by	habit.	We	are	continually	undergoing
microevolutions	of	the	self.

Each	habit	is	like	a	suggestion:	“Hey,	maybe	this	is	who	I	am.”	If	you

finish	a	book,	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person	who	likes
reading.	If	you	go	to	the	gym,	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person
who	likes	exercise.	If	you	practice	playing	the	guitar,	perhaps	you	are
the	type	of	person	who	likes	music.

Every	action	you	take	is	a	vote	for	the	type	of	person	you	wish	to
become.	No	single	instance	will	transform	your	beliefs,	but	as	the	votes
build	up,	so	does	the	evidence	of	your	new	identity.	This	is	one	reason
why	meaningful	change	does	not	require	radical	change.	Small	habits
can	make	a	meaningful	difference	by	providing	evidence	of	a	new
identity.	And	if	a	change	is	meaningful,	it	actually	is	big.	That’s	the
paradox	of	making	small	improvements.

Putting	this	all	together,	you	can	see	that	habits	are	the	path	to
changing	your	identity.	The	most	practical	way	to	change	who	you	are
is	to	change	what	you	do.

Each	time	you	write	a	page,	you	are	a	writer.

Each	time	you	practice	the	violin,	you	are	a	musician.

Each	time	you	start	a	workout,	you	are	an	athlete.

Each	time	you	encourage	your	employees,	you	are	a	leader.

Each	habit	not	only	gets	results	but	also	teaches	you	something	far
more	important:	to	trust	yourself.	You	start	to	believe	you	can	actually
accomplish	these	things.	When	the	votes	mount	up	and	the	evidence
begins	to	change,	the	story	you	tell	yourself	begins	to	change	as	well.

Of	course,	it	works	the	opposite	way,	too.	Every	time	you	choose	to
perform	a	bad	habit,	it’s	a	vote	for	that	identity.	The	good	news	is	that
you	don’t	need	to	be	perfect.	In	any	election,	there	are	going	to	be	votes
for	both	sides.	You	don’t	need	a	unanimous	vote	to	win	an	election;
you	just	need	a	majority.	It	doesn’t	matter	if	you	cast	a	few	votes	for	a
bad	behavior	or	an	unproductive	habit.	Your	goal	is	simply	to	win	the
majority	of	the	time.

New	identities	require	new	evidence.	If	you	keep	casting	the	same

votes	you’ve	always	cast,	you’re	going	to	get	the	same	results	you’ve
always	had.	If	nothing	changes,	nothing	is	going	to	change.

It	is	a	simple	two-step	process:

1.	 Decide	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be.

2.	 Prove	it	to	yourself	with	small	wins.

First,	decide	who	you	want	to	be.	This	holds	at	any	level—as	an
individual,	as	a	team,	as	a	community,	as	a	nation.	What	do	you	want
to	stand	for?	What	are	your	principles	and	values?	Who	do	you	wish	to
become?

These	are	big	questions,	and	many	people	aren’t	sure	where	to	begin

—but	they	do	know	what	kind	of	results	they	want:	to	get	six-pack	abs
or	to	feel	less	anxious	or	to	double	their	salary.	That’s	fine.	Start	there
and	work	backward	from	the	results	you	want	to	the	type	of	person
who	could	get	those	results.	Ask	yourself,	“Who	is	the	type	of	person
that	could	get	the	outcome	I	want?”	Who	is	the	type	of	person	that
could	lose	forty	pounds?	Who	is	the	type	of	person	that	could	learn	a
new	language?	Who	is	the	type	of	person	that	could	run	a	successful
start-up?

For	example,	“Who	is	the	type	of	person	who	could	write	a	book?”
It’s	probably	someone	who	is	consistent	and	reliable.	Now	your	focus
shifts	from	writing	a	book	(outcome-based)	to	being	the	type	of	person
who	is	consistent	and	reliable	(identity-based).

This	process	can	lead	to	beliefs	like:

“I’m	the	kind	of	teacher	who	stands	up	for	her	students.”

“I’m	the	kind	of	doctor	who	gives	each	patient	the	time	and
empathy	they	need.”

“I’m	the	kind	of	manager	who	advocates	for	her	employees.”

Once	you	have	a	handle	on	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be,	you
can	begin	taking	small	steps	to	reinforce	your	desired	identity.	I	have	a
friend	who	lost	over	100	pounds	by	asking	herself,	“What	would	a
healthy	person	do?”	All	day	long,	she	would	use	this	question	as	a
guide.	Would	a	healthy	person	walk	or	take	a	cab?	Would	a	healthy
person	order	a	burrito	or	a	salad?	She	figured	if	she	acted	like	a	healthy
person	long	enough,	eventually	she	would	become	that	person.	She
was	right.

The	concept	of	identity-based	habits	is	our	first	introduction	to
another	key	theme	in	this	book:	feedback	loops.	Your	habits	shape
your	identity,	and	your	identity	shapes	your	habits.	It’s	a	two-way
street.	The	formation	of	all	habits	is	a	feedback	loop	(a	concept	we	will
explore	in	depth	in	the	next	chapter),	but	it’s	important	to	let	your
values,	principles,	and	identity	drive	the	loop	rather	than	your	results.
The	focus	should	always	be	on	becoming	that	type	of	person,	not
getting	a	particular	outcome.

THE	REAL	REASON	HABITS	MATTER

Identity	change	is	the	North	Star	of	habit	change.	The	remainder	of
this	book	will	provide	you	with	step-by-step	instructions	on	how	to
build	better	habits	in	yourself,	your	family,	your	team,	your	company,
and	anywhere	else	you	wish.	But	the	true	question	is:	“Are	you
becoming	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	become?”	The	first	step	is	not
what	or	how,	but	who.	You	need	to	know	who	you	want	to	be.
Otherwise,	your	quest	for	change	is	like	a	boat	without	a	rudder.	And
that’s	why	we	are	starting	here.

You	have	the	power	to	change	your	beliefs	about	yourself.	Your
identity	is	not	set	in	stone.	You	have	a	choice	in	every	moment.	You
can	choose	the	identity	you	want	to	reinforce	today	with	the	habits	you
choose	today.	And	this	brings	us	to	the	deeper	purpose	of	this	book
and	the	real	reason	habits	matter.

Building	better	habits	isn’t	about	littering	your	day	with	life	hacks.

It’s	not	about	flossing	one	tooth	each	night	or	taking	a	cold	shower
each	morning	or	wearing	the	same	outfit	each	day.	It’s	not	about
achieving	external	measures	of	success	like	earning	more	money,
losing	weight,	or	reducing	stress.	Habits	can	help	you	achieve	all	of
these	things,	but	fundamentally	they	are	not	about	having	something.
They	are	about	becoming	someone.

Ultimately,	your	habits	matter	because	they	help	you	become	the
type	of	person	you	wish	to	be.	They	are	the	channel	through	which	you
develop	your	deepest	beliefs	about	yourself.	Quite	literally,	you	become
your	habits.

Chapter	Summary

There	are	three	levels	of	change:	outcome	change,	process	change,
and	identity	change.

The	most	effective	way	to	change	your	habits	is	to	focus	not	on
what	you	want	to	achieve,	but	on	who	you	wish	to	become.

Your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits.	Every	action	is	a	vote	for
the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become.

Becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself	requires	you	to
continuously	edit	your	beliefs,	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your
identity.

The	real	reason	habits	matter	is	not	because	they	can	get	you
better	results	(although	they	can	do	that),	but	because	they	can
change	your	beliefs	about	yourself.

3

How	to	Build	Better	Habits	in	4	Simple
Steps

I

N	1898,	A	psychologist	named	Edward	Thorndike	conducted	an
experiment	that	would	lay	the	foundation	for	our	understanding	of
how	habits	form	and	the	rules	that	guide	our	behavior.	Thorndike	was
interested	in	studying	the	behavior	of	animals,	and	he	started	by
working	with	cats.

He	would	place	each	cat	inside	a	device	known	as	a	puzzle	box.	The
box	was	designed	so	that	the	cat	could	escape	through	a	door	“by	some
simple	act,	such	as	pulling	at	a	loop	of	cord,	pressing	a	lever,	or
stepping	on	a	platform.”	For	example,	one	box	contained	a	lever	that,
when	pressed,	would	open	a	door	on	the	side	of	the	box.	Once	the	door
had	been	opened,	the	cat	could	dart	out	and	run	over	to	a	bowl	of	food.

Most	cats	wanted	to	escape	as	soon	as	they	were	placed	inside	the

box.	They	would	poke	their	nose	into	the	corners,	stick	their	paws
through	openings,	and	claw	at	loose	objects.	After	a	few	minutes	of
exploration,	the	cats	would	happen	to	press	the	magical	lever,	the	door
would	open,	and	they	would	escape.

Thorndike	tracked	the	behavior	of	each	cat	across	many	trials.	In
the	beginning,	the	animals	moved	around	the	box	at	random.	But	as
soon	as	the	lever	had	been	pressed	and	the	door	opened,	the	process	of
learning	began.	Gradually,	each	cat	learned	to	associate	the	action	of
pressing	the	lever	with	the	reward	of	escaping	the	box	and	getting	to
the	food.

After	twenty	to	thirty	trials,	this	behavior	became	so	automatic	and
habitual	that	the	cat	could	escape	within	a	few	seconds.	For	example,

Thorndike	noted,	“Cat	12	took	the	following	times	to	perform	the	act.
160	seconds,	30	seconds,	90	seconds,	60,	15,	28,	20,	30,	22,	11,	15,	20,
12,	10,	14,	10,	8,	8,	5,	10,	8,	6,	6,	7.”

During	the	first	three	trials,	the	cat	escaped	in	an	average	of	1.5
minutes.	During	the	last	three	trials,	it	escaped	in	an	average	of	6.3
seconds.	With	practice,	each	cat	made	fewer	errors	and	their	actions
became	quicker	and	more	automatic.	Rather	than	repeat	the	same
mistakes,	the	cat	began	to	cut	straight	to	the	solution.

From	his	studies,	Thorndike	described	the	learning	process	by
stating,	“behaviors	followed	by	satisfying	consequences	tend	to	be
repeated	and	those	that	produce	unpleasant	consequences	are	less
likely	to	be	repeated.”	His	work	provides	the	perfect	starting	point	for
discussing	how	habits	form	in	our	own	lives.	It	also	provides	answers
to	some	fundamental	questions	like:	What	are	habits?	And	why	does
the	brain	bother	building	them	at	all?

WHY	YOUR	BRAIN	BUILDS	HABITS

A	habit	is	a	behavior	that	has	been	repeated	enough	times	to	become
automatic.	The	process	of	habit	formation	begins	with	trial	and	error.
Whenever	you	encounter	a	new	situation	in	life,	your	brain	has	to
make	a	decision.	How	do	I	respond	to	this?	The	first	time	you	come
across	a	problem,	you’re	not	sure	how	to	solve	it.	Like	Thorndike’s	cat,
you’re	just	trying	things	out	to	see	what	works.

Neurological	activity	in	the	brain	is	high	during	this	period.	You	are
carefully	analyzing	the	situation	and	making	conscious	decisions	about
how	to	act.	You’re	taking	in	tons	of	new	information	and	trying	to
make	sense	of	it	all.	The	brain	is	busy	learning	the	most	effective
course	of	action.

Occasionally,	like	a	cat	pressing	on	a	lever,	you	stumble	across	a
solution.	You’re	feeling	anxious,	and	you	discover	that	going	for	a	run
calms	you	down.	You’re	mentally	exhausted	from	a	long	day	of	work,
and	you	learn	that	playing	video	games	relaxes	you.	You’re	exploring,
exploring,	exploring,	and	then—BAM—a	reward.

After	you	stumble	upon	an	unexpected	reward,	you	alter	your
strategy	for	next	time.	Your	brain	immediately	begins	to	catalog	the

events	that	preceded	the	reward.	Wait	a	minute—that	felt	good.	What
did	I	do	right	before	that?

This	is	the	feedback	loop	behind	all	human	behavior:	try,	fail,	learn,

try	differently.	With	practice,	the	useless	movements	fade	away	and
the	useful	actions	get	reinforced.	That’s	a	habit	forming.

Whenever	you	face	a	problem	repeatedly,	your	brain	begins	to
automate	the	process	of	solving	it.	Your	habits	are	just	a	series	of
automatic	solutions	that	solve	the	problems	and	stresses	you	face
regularly.	As	behavioral	scientist	Jason	Hreha	writes,	“Habits	are,
simply,	reliable	solutions	to	recurring	problems	in	our	environment.”

As	habits	are	created,	the	level	of	activity	in	the	brain	decreases.

You	learn	to	lock	in	on	the	cues	that	predict	success	and	tune	out
everything	else.	When	a	similar	situation	arises	in	the	future,	you	know
exactly	what	to	look	for.	There	is	no	longer	a	need	to	analyze	every
angle	of	a	situation.	Your	brain	skips	the	process	of	trial	and	error	and
creates	a	mental	rule:	if	this,	then	that.	These	cognitive	scripts	can	be
followed	automatically	whenever	the	situation	is	appropriate.	Now,
whenever	you	feel	stressed,	you	get	the	itch	to	run.	As	soon	as	you	walk
in	the	door	from	work,	you	grab	the	video	game	controller.	A	choice
that	once	required	effort	is	now	automatic.	A	habit	has	been	created.

Habits	are	mental	shortcuts	learned	from	experience.	In	a	sense,	a
habit	is	just	a	memory	of	the	steps	you	previously	followed	to	solve	a
problem	in	the	past.	Whenever	the	conditions	are	right,	you	can	draw
on	this	memory	and	automatically	apply	the	same	solution.	The
primary	reason	the	brain	remembers	the	past	is	to	better	predict	what
will	work	in	the	future.

Habit	formation	is	incredibly	useful	because	the	conscious	mind	is
the	bottleneck	of	the	brain.	It	can	only	pay	attention	to	one	problem	at
a	time.	As	a	result,	your	brain	is	always	working	to	preserve	your
conscious	attention	for	whatever	task	is	most	essential.	Whenever
possible,	the	conscious	mind	likes	to	pawn	off	tasks	to	the
nonconscious	mind	to	do	automatically.	This	is	precisely	what	happens
when	a	habit	is	formed.	Habits	reduce	cognitive	load	and	free	up
mental	capacity,	so	you	can	allocate	your	attention	to	other	tasks.

Despite	their	efficiency,	some	people	still	wonder	about	the	benefits
of	habits.	The	argument	goes	like	this:	“Will	habits	make	my	life	dull?	I
don’t	want	to	pigeonhole	myself	into	a	lifestyle	I	don’t	enjoy.	Doesn’t

so	much	routine	take	away	the	vibrancy	and	spontaneity	of	life?”
Hardly.	Such	questions	set	up	a	false	dichotomy.	They	make	you	think
that	you	have	to	choose	between	building	habits	and	attaining
freedom.	In	reality,	the	two	complement	each	other.

Habits	do	not	restrict	freedom.	They	create	it.	In	fact,	the	people
who	don’t	have	their	habits	handled	are	often	the	ones	with	the	least
amount	of	freedom.	Without	good	financial	habits,	you	will	always	be
struggling	for	the	next	dollar.	Without	good	health	habits,	you	will
always	seem	to	be	short	on	energy.	Without	good	learning	habits,	you
will	always	feel	like	you’re	behind	the	curve.	If	you’re	always	being
forced	to	make	decisions	about	simple	tasks—when	should	I	work	out,
where	do	I	go	to	write,	when	do	I	pay	the	bills—then	you	have	less	time
for	freedom.	It’s	only	by	making	the	fundamentals	of	life	easier	that
you	can	create	the	mental	space	needed	for	free	thinking	and
creativity.

Conversely,	when	you	have	your	habits	dialed	in	and	the	basics	of
life	are	handled	and	done,	your	mind	is	free	to	focus	on	new	challenges
and	master	the	next	set	of	problems.	Building	habits	in	the	present
allows	you	to	do	more	of	what	you	want	in	the	future.

THE	SCIENCE	OF	HOW	HABITS	WORK

The	process	of	building	a	habit	can	be	divided	into	four	simple	steps:
cue,	craving,	response,	and	reward.*	Breaking	it	down	into	these
fundamental	parts	can	help	us	understand	what	a	habit	is,	how	it
works,	and	how	to	improve	it.

FIGURE	5:	All	habits	proceed	through	four	stages	in	the	same	order:	cue,
craving,	response,	and	reward.

This	four-step	pattern	is	the	backbone	of	every	habit,	and	your	brain

runs	through	these	steps	in	the	same	order	each	time.

First,	there	is	the	cue.	The	cue	triggers	your	brain	to	initiate	a

behavior.	It	is	a	bit	of	information	that	predicts	a	reward.	Our
prehistoric	ancestors	were	paying	attention	to	cues	that	signaled	the
location	of	primary	rewards	like	food,	water,	and	sex.	Today,	we	spend
most	of	our	time	learning	cues	that	predict	secondary	rewards	like
money	and	fame,	power	and	status,	praise	and	approval,	love	and
friendship,	or	a	sense	of	personal	satisfaction.	(Of	course,	these
pursuits	also	indirectly	improve	our	odds	of	survival	and	reproduction,
which	is	the	deeper	motive	behind	everything	we	do.)

Your	mind	is	continuously	analyzing	your	internal	and	external
environment	for	hints	of	where	rewards	are	located.	Because	the	cue	is
the	first	indication	that	we’re	close	to	a	reward,	it	naturally	leads	to	a
craving.

Cravings	are	the	second	step,	and	they	are	the	motivational	force

behind	every	habit.	Without	some	level	of	motivation	or	desire—
without	craving	a	change—we	have	no	reason	to	act.	What	you	crave	is
not	the	habit	itself	but	the	change	in	state	it	delivers.	You	do	not	crave
smoking	a	cigarette,	you	crave	the	feeling	of	relief	it	provides.	You	are
not	motivated	by	brushing	your	teeth	but	rather	by	the	feeling	of	a
clean	mouth.	You	do	not	want	to	turn	on	the	television,	you	want	to	be
entertained.	Every	craving	is	linked	to	a	desire	to	change	your	internal
state.	This	is	an	important	point	that	we	will	discuss	in	detail	later.

Cravings	differ	from	person	to	person.	In	theory,	any	piece	of
information	could	trigger	a	craving,	but	in	practice,	people	are	not
motivated	by	the	same	cues.	For	a	gambler,	the	sound	of	slot	machines
can	be	a	potent	trigger	that	sparks	an	intense	wave	of	desire.	For
someone	who	rarely	gambles,	the	jingles	and	chimes	of	the	casino	are
just	background	noise.	Cues	are	meaningless	until	they	are	interpreted.
The	thoughts,	feelings,	and	emotions	of	the	observer	are	what
transform	a	cue	into	a	craving.

The	third	step	is	the	response.	The	response	is	the	actual	habit	you
perform,	which	can	take	the	form	of	a	thought	or	an	action.	Whether	a
response	occurs	depends	on	how	motivated	you	are	and	how	much
friction	is	associated	with	the	behavior.	If	a	particular	action	requires
more	physical	or	mental	effort	than	you	are	willing	to	expend,	then	you
won’t	do	it.	Your	response	also	depends	on	your	ability.	It	sounds
simple,	but	a	habit	can	occur	only	if	you	are	capable	of	doing	it.	If	you

want	to	dunk	a	basketball	but	can’t	jump	high	enough	to	reach	the
hoop,	well,	you’re	out	of	luck.

Finally,	the	response	delivers	a	reward.	Rewards	are	the	end	goal	of
every	habit.	The	cue	is	about	noticing	the	reward.	The	craving	is	about
wanting	the	reward.	The	response	is	about	obtaining	the	reward.	We
chase	rewards	because	they	serve	two	purposes:	(1)	they	satisfy	us	and
(2)	they	teach	us.

The	first	purpose	of	rewards	is	to	satisfy	your	craving.	Yes,	rewards

provide	benefits	on	their	own.	Food	and	water	deliver	the	energy	you
need	to	survive.	Getting	a	promotion	brings	more	money	and	respect.
Getting	in	shape	improves	your	health	and	your	dating	prospects.	But
the	more	immediate	benefit	is	that	rewards	satisfy	your	craving	to	eat
or	to	gain	status	or	to	win	approval.	At	least	for	a	moment,	rewards
deliver	contentment	and	relief	from	craving.

Second,	rewards	teach	us	which	actions	are	worth	remembering	in
the	future.	Your	brain	is	a	reward	detector.	As	you	go	about	your	life,
your	sensory	nervous	system	is	continuously	monitoring	which	actions
satisfy	your	desires	and	deliver	pleasure.	Feelings	of	pleasure	and
disappointment	are	part	of	the	feedback	mechanism	that	helps	your
brain	distinguish	useful	actions	from	useless	ones.	Rewards	close	the
feedback	loop	and	complete	the	habit	cycle.

If	a	behavior	is	insufficient	in	any	of	the	four	stages,	it	will	not
become	a	habit.	Eliminate	the	cue	and	your	habit	will	never	start.
Reduce	the	craving	and	you	won’t	experience	enough	motivation	to
act.	Make	the	behavior	difficult	and	you	won’t	be	able	to	do	it.	And	if
the	reward	fails	to	satisfy	your	desire,	then	you’ll	have	no	reason	to	do
it	again	in	the	future.	Without	the	first	three	steps,	a	behavior	will	not
occur.	Without	all	four,	a	behavior	will	not	be	repeated.

THE	HABIT	LOOP

FIGURE	6:	The	four	stages	of	habit	are	best	described	as	a	feedback	loop.
They	form	an	endless	cycle	that	is	running	every	moment	you	are	alive.	This
“habit	loop”	is	continually	scanning	the	environment,	predicting	what	will
happen	next,	trying	out	different	responses,	and	learning	from	the	results.*

In	summary,	the	cue	triggers	a	craving,	which	motivates	a	response,

which	provides	a	reward,	which	satisfies	the	craving	and,	ultimately,
becomes	associated	with	the	cue.	Together,	these	four	steps	form	a
neurological	feedback	loop—cue,	craving,	response,	reward;	cue,
craving,	response,	reward—that	ultimately	allows	you	to	create
automatic	habits.	This	cycle	is	known	as	the	habit	loop.

This	four-step	process	is	not	something	that	happens	occasionally,

but	rather	it	is	an	endless	feedback	loop	that	is	running	and	active
during	every	moment	you	are	alive—even	now.	The	brain	is	continually
scanning	the	environment,	predicting	what	will	happen	next,	trying
out	different	responses,	and	learning	from	the	results.	The	entire
process	is	completed	in	a	split	second,	and	we	use	it	again	and	again
without	realizing	everything	that	has	been	packed	into	the	previous
moment.

We	can	split	these	four	steps	into	two	phases:	the	problem	phase
and	the	solution	phase.	The	problem	phase	includes	the	cue	and	the
craving,	and	it	is	when	you	realize	that	something	needs	to	change.	The
solution	phase	includes	the	response	and	the	reward,	and	it	is	when
you	take	action	and	achieve	the	change	you	desire.

All	behavior	is	driven	by	the	desire	to	solve	a	problem.	Sometimes
the	problem	is	that	you	notice	something	good	and	you	want	to	obtain
it.	Sometimes	the	problem	is	that	you	are	experiencing	pain	and	you
want	to	relieve	it.	Either	way,	the	purpose	of	every	habit	is	to	solve	the
problems	you	face.

In	the	table	on	the	following	page,	you	can	see	a	few	examples	of

what	this	looks	like	in	real	life.

Imagine	walking	into	a	dark	room	and	flipping	on	the	light	switch.

You	have	performed	this	simple	habit	so	many	times	that	it	occurs
without	thinking.	You	proceed	through	all	four	stages	in	the	fraction	of
a	second.	The	urge	to	act	strikes	you	without	thinking.

Problem	phase

1.	Cue:	Your	phone	buzzes	with	a	new	text	message.

2.	Craving:	You	want	to	learn	the	contents	of	the	message.

3.	Response:	You	grab	your	phone	and	read	the	text.

Solution	phase

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	read	the	message.	Grabbing	your	phone	becomes

associated	with	your	phone	buzzing.

1.	Cue:	You	are	answering	emails.

Problem	phase

2.	Craving:	You	begin	to	feel	stressed	and	overwhelmed	by	work.	You	want	to	feel	in	control.

3.	Response:	You	bite	your	nails.

Solution	phase

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	reduce	stress.	Biting	your	nails	becomes	associated

with	answering	email.

1.	Cue:	You	wake	up.

2.	Craving:	You	want	to	feel	alert.

Problem	phase

Solution	phase

3.	Response:	You	drink	a	cup	of	coffee.

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	feel	alert.	Drinking	coffee	becomes	associated	with

waking	up.

1.	Cue:	You	smell	a	doughnut	shop	as	you	walk	down	the	street	near	your	office.

Problem	phase

2.	Craving:	You	begin	to	crave	a	doughnut.

Solution	phase

3.	Response:	You	buy	a	doughnut	and	eat	it.

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	eat	a	doughnut.	Buying	a	doughnut	becomes

associated	with	walking	down	the	street	near	your	office.

1.	Cue:	You	hit	a	stumbling	block	on	a	project	at	work.

2.	Craving:	You	feel	stuck	and	want	to	relieve	your	frustration.

Problem	phase

Solution	phase

3.	Response:	You	pull	out	your	phone	and	check	social	media.

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	feel	relieved.	Checking	social	media	becomes

associated	with	feeling	stalled	at	work.

Problem	phase

1.	Cue:	You	walk	into	a	dark	room.

2.	Craving:	You	want	to	be	able	to	see.

3.	Response:	You	flip	the	light	switch.

Solution	phase

4.	Reward:	You	satisfy	your	craving	to	see.	Turning	on	the	light	switch	becomes	associated

with	being	in	a	dark	room.

By	the	time	we	become	adults,	we	rarely	notice	the	habits	that	are
running	our	lives.	Most	of	us	never	give	a	second	thought	to	the	fact
that	we	tie	the	same	shoe	first	each	morning,	or	unplug	the	toaster
after	each	use,	or	always	change	into	comfortable	clothes	after	getting
home	from	work.	After	decades	of	mental	programming,	we
automatically	slip	into	these	patterns	of	thinking	and	acting.

THE	FOUR	LAWS	OF	BEHAVIOR	CHANGE

In	the	following	chapters,	we	will	see	time	and	again	how	the	four
stages	of	cue,	craving,	response,	and	reward	influence	nearly
everything	we	do	each	day.	But	before	we	do	that,	we	need	to

transform	these	four	steps	into	a	practical	framework	that	we	can	use
to	design	good	habits	and	eliminate	bad	ones.

I	refer	to	this	framework	as	the	Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change,	and

it	provides	a	simple	set	of	rules	for	creating	good	habits	and	breaking
bad	ones.	You	can	think	of	each	law	as	a	lever	that	influences	human
behavior.	When	the	levers	are	in	the	right	positions,	creating	good
habits	is	effortless.	When	they	are	in	the	wrong	positions,	it	is	nearly
impossible.

How	to	Create	a	Good	Habit

The	1st	law	(Cue):	Make	it	obvious.

The	2nd	law	(Craving):	Make	it	attractive.

The	3rd	law	(Response):	Make	it	easy.

The	4th	law	(Reward):	Make	it	satisfying.

We	can	invert	these	laws	to	learn	how	to	break	a	bad	habit.

How	to	Break	a	Bad	Habit

Inversion	of	the	1st	law	(Cue):	Make	it	invisible.

Inversion	of	the	2nd	law	(Craving):	Make	it	unattractive.

Inversion	of	the	3rd	law	(Response):	Make	it	difficult.

Inversion	of	the	4th	law	(Reward):	Make	it	unsatisfying.

It	would	be	irresponsible	for	me	to	claim	that	these	four	laws	are	an

exhaustive	framework	for	changing	any	human	behavior,	but	I	think
they’re	close.	As	you	will	soon	see,	the	Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change
apply	to	nearly	every	field,	from	sports	to	politics,	art	to	medicine,
comedy	to	management.	These	laws	can	be	used	no	matter	what
challenge	you	are	facing.	There	is	no	need	for	completely	different
strategies	for	each	habit.

Whenever	you	want	to	change	your	behavior,	you	can	simply	ask

yourself:

1.	 How	can	I	make	it	obvious?

2.	 How	can	I	make	it	attractive?

3.	 How	can	I	make	it	easy?

4.	 How	can	I	make	it	satisfying?

If	you	have	ever	wondered,	“Why	don’t	I	do	what	I	say	I’m	going	to
do?	Why	don’t	I	lose	the	weight	or	stop	smoking	or	save	for	retirement
or	start	that	side	business?	Why	do	I	say	something	is	important	but
never	seem	to	make	time	for	it?”	The	answers	to	those	questions	can	be
found	somewhere	in	these	four	laws.	The	key	to	creating	good	habits
and	breaking	bad	ones	is	to	understand	these	fundamental	laws	and
how	to	alter	them	to	your	specifications.	Every	goal	is	doomed	to	fail	if
it	goes	against	the	grain	of	human	nature.

Your	habits	are	shaped	by	the	systems	in	your	life.	In	the	chapters
that	follow,	we	will	discuss	these	laws	one	by	one	and	show	how	you
can	use	them	to	create	a	system	in	which	good	habits	emerge	naturally
and	bad	habits	wither	away.

Chapter	Summary

A	habit	is	a	behavior	that	has	been	repeated	enough	times	to
become	automatic.

The	ultimate	purpose	of	habits	is	to	solve	the	problems	of	life	with
as	little	energy	and	effort	as	possible.

Any	habit	can	be	broken	down	into	a	feedback	loop	that	involves
four	steps:	cue,	craving,	response,	and	reward.

The	Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change	are	a	simple	set	of	rules	we
can	use	to	build	better	habits.	They	are	(1)	make	it	obvious,	(2)
make	it	attractive,	(3)	make	it	easy,	and	(4)	make	it	satisfying.

THE	1ST	LAW

Make	It	Obvious

4

The	Man	Who	Didn’t	Look	Right

THE	PSYCHOLOGIST	GARY	Klein	once	told	me	a	story	about	a	woman	who
attended	a	family	gathering.	She	had	spent	years	working	as	a
paramedic	and,	upon	arriving	at	the	event,	took	one	look	at	her	father-
in-law	and	got	very	concerned.

“I	don’t	like	the	way	you	look,”	she	said.

Her	father-in-law,	who	was	feeling	perfectly	fine,	jokingly	replied,

“Well,	I	don’t	like	your	looks,	either.”

“No,”	she	insisted.	“You	need	to	go	to	the	hospital	now.”

A	few	hours	later,	the	man	was	undergoing	lifesaving	surgery	after
an	examination	had	revealed	that	he	had	a	blockage	to	a	major	artery
and	was	at	immediate	risk	of	a	heart	attack.	Without	his	daughter-in-
law’s	intuition,	he	could	have	died.

What	did	the	paramedic	see?	How	did	she	predict	his	impending

heart	attack?

When	major	arteries	are	obstructed,	the	body	focuses	on	sending
blood	to	critical	organs	and	away	from	peripheral	locations	near	the
surface	of	the	skin.	The	result	is	a	change	in	the	pattern	of	distribution
of	blood	in	the	face.	After	many	years	of	working	with	people	with
heart	failure,	the	woman	had	unknowingly	developed	the	ability	to
recognize	this	pattern	on	sight.	She	couldn’t	explain	what	it	was	that
she	noticed	in	her	father-in-law’s	face,	but	she	knew	something	was
wrong.

Similar	stories	exist	in	other	fields.	For	example,	military	analysts

can	identify	which	blip	on	a	radar	screen	is	an	enemy	missile	and

which	one	is	a	plane	from	their	own	fleet	even	though	they	are
traveling	at	the	same	speed,	flying	at	the	same	altitude,	and	look
identical	on	radar	in	nearly	every	respect.	During	the	Gulf	War,
Lieutenant	Commander	Michael	Riley	saved	an	entire	battleship	when
he	ordered	a	missile	shot	down—despite	the	fact	that	it	looked	exactly
like	the	battleship’s	own	planes	on	radar.	He	made	the	right	call,	but
even	his	superior	officers	couldn’t	explain	how	he	did	it.

Museum	curators	have	been	known	to	discern	the	difference

between	an	authentic	piece	of	art	and	an	expertly	produced	counterfeit
even	though	they	can’t	tell	you	precisely	which	details	tipped	them	off.
Experienced	radiologists	can	look	at	a	brain	scan	and	predict	the	area
where	a	stroke	will	develop	before	any	obvious	signs	are	visible	to	the
untrained	eye.	I’ve	even	heard	of	hairdressers	noticing	whether	a	client
is	pregnant	based	only	on	the	feel	of	her	hair.

The	human	brain	is	a	prediction	machine.	It	is	continuously	taking

in	your	surroundings	and	analyzing	the	information	it	comes	across.
Whenever	you	experience	something	repeatedly—like	a	paramedic
seeing	the	face	of	a	heart	attack	patient	or	a	military	analyst	seeing	a
missile	on	a	radar	screen—your	brain	begins	noticing	what	is
important,	sorting	through	the	details	and	highlighting	the	relevant
cues,	and	cataloging	that	information	for	future	use.

With	enough	practice,	you	can	pick	up	on	the	cues	that	predict

certain	outcomes	without	consciously	thinking	about	it.	Automatically,
your	brain	encodes	the	lessons	learned	through	experience.	We	can’t
always	explain	what	it	is	we	are	learning,	but	learning	is	happening	all
along	the	way,	and	your	ability	to	notice	the	relevant	cues	in	a	given
situation	is	the	foundation	for	every	habit	you	have.

We	underestimate	how	much	our	brains	and	bodies	can	do	without

thinking.	You	do	not	tell	your	hair	to	grow,	your	heart	to	pump,	your
lungs	to	breathe,	or	your	stomach	to	digest.	And	yet	your	body	handles
all	this	and	more	on	autopilot.	You	are	much	more	than	your	conscious
self.

Consider	hunger.	How	do	you	know	when	you’re	hungry?	You	don’t
necessarily	have	to	see	a	cookie	on	the	counter	to	realize	that	it	is	time
to	eat.	Appetite	and	hunger	are	governed	nonconsciously.	Your	body
has	a	variety	of	feedback	loops	that	gradually	alert	you	when	it	is	time
to	eat	again	and	that	track	what	is	going	on	around	you	and	within	you.
Cravings	can	arise	thanks	to	hormones	and	chemicals	circulating

through	your	body.	Suddenly,	you’re	hungry	even	though	you’re	not
quite	sure	what	tipped	you	off.

This	is	one	of	the	most	surprising	insights	about	our	habits:	you
don’t	need	to	be	aware	of	the	cue	for	a	habit	to	begin.	You	can	notice	an
opportunity	and	take	action	without	dedicating	conscious	attention	to
it.	This	is	what	makes	habits	useful.

It’s	also	what	makes	them	dangerous.	As	habits	form,	your	actions
come	under	the	direction	of	your	automatic	and	nonconscious	mind.
You	fall	into	old	patterns	before	you	realize	what’s	happening.	Unless
someone	points	it	out,	you	may	not	notice	that	you	cover	your	mouth
with	your	hand	whenever	you	laugh,	that	you	apologize	before	asking	a
question,	or	that	you	have	a	habit	of	finishing	other	people’s	sentences.
And	the	more	you	repeat	these	patterns,	the	less	likely	you	become	to
question	what	you’re	doing	and	why	you’re	doing	it.

I	once	heard	of	a	retail	clerk	who	was	instructed	to	cut	up	empty	gift

cards	after	customers	had	used	up	the	balance	on	the	card.	One	day,
the	clerk	cashed	out	a	few	customers	in	a	row	who	purchased	with	gift
cards.	When	the	next	person	walked	up,	the	clerk	swiped	the
customer’s	actual	credit	card,	picked	up	the	scissors,	and	then	cut	it	in
half—entirely	on	autopilot—before	looking	up	at	the	stunned	customer
and	realizing	what	had	just	happened.

Another	woman	I	came	across	in	my	research	was	a	former

preschool	teacher	who	had	switched	to	a	corporate	job.	Even	though
she	was	now	working	with	adults,	her	old	habits	would	kick	in	and	she
kept	asking	coworkers	if	they	had	washed	their	hands	after	going	to	the
bathroom.	I	also	found	the	story	of	a	man	who	had	spent	years
working	as	a	lifeguard	and	would	occasionally	yell	“Walk!”	whenever
he	saw	a	child	running.

Over	time,	the	cues	that	spark	our	habits	become	so	common	that

they	are	essentially	invisible:	the	treats	on	the	kitchen	counter,	the
remote	control	next	to	the	couch,	the	phone	in	our	pocket.	Our
responses	to	these	cues	are	so	deeply	encoded	that	it	may	feel	like	the
urge	to	act	comes	from	nowhere.	For	this	reason,	we	must	begin	the
process	of	behavior	change	with	awareness.

Before	we	can	effectively	build	new	habits,	we	need	to	get	a	handle

on	our	current	ones.	This	can	be	more	challenging	than	it	sounds
because	once	a	habit	is	firmly	rooted	in	your	life,	it	is	mostly

nonconscious	and	automatic.	If	a	habit	remains	mindless,	you	can’t
expect	to	improve	it.	As	the	psychologist	Carl	Jung	said,	“Until	you
make	the	unconscious	conscious,	it	will	direct	your	life	and	you	will
call	it	fate.”

THE	HABITS	SCORECARD

The	Japanese	railway	system	is	regarded	as	one	of	the	best	in	the
world.	If	you	ever	find	yourself	riding	a	train	in	Tokyo,	you’ll	notice
that	the	conductors	have	a	peculiar	habit.

As	each	operator	runs	the	train,	they	proceed	through	a	ritual	of
pointing	at	different	objects	and	calling	out	commands.	When	the	train
approaches	a	signal,	the	operator	will	point	at	it	and	say,	“Signal	is
green.”	As	the	train	pulls	into	and	out	of	each	station,	the	operator	will
point	at	the	speedometer	and	call	out	the	exact	speed.	When	it’s	time
to	leave,	the	operator	will	point	at	the	timetable	and	state	the	time.	Out
on	the	platform,	other	employees	are	performing	similar	actions.
Before	each	train	departs,	staff	members	will	point	along	the	edge	of
the	platform	and	declare,	“All	clear!”	Every	detail	is	identified,	pointed
at,	and	named	aloud.*

This	process,	known	as	Pointing-and-Calling,	is	a	safety	system
designed	to	reduce	mistakes.	It	seems	silly,	but	it	works	incredibly
well.	Pointing-and-Calling	reduces	errors	by	up	to	85	percent	and	cuts
accidents	by	30	percent.	The	MTA	subway	system	in	New	York	City
adopted	a	modified	version	that	is	“point-only,”	and	“within	two	years
of	implementation,	incidents	of	incorrectly	berthed	subways	fell	57
percent.”

Pointing-and-Calling	is	so	effective	because	it	raises	the	level	of

awareness	from	a	nonconscious	habit	to	a	more	conscious	level.
Because	the	train	operators	must	use	their	eyes,	hands,	mouth,	and
ears,	they	are	more	likely	to	notice	problems	before	something	goes
wrong.

My	wife	does	something	similar.	Whenever	we	are	preparing	to
walk	out	the	door	for	a	trip,	she	verbally	calls	out	the	most	essential
items	in	her	packing	list.	“I’ve	got	my	keys.	I’ve	got	my	wallet.	I’ve	got
my	glasses.	I’ve	got	my	husband.”

The	more	automatic	a	behavior	becomes,	the	less	likely	we	are	to

consciously	think	about	it.	And	when	we’ve	done	something	a
thousand	times	before,	we	begin	to	overlook	things.	We	assume	that
the	next	time	will	be	just	like	the	last.	We’re	so	used	to	doing	what
we’ve	always	done	that	we	don’t	stop	to	question	whether	it’s	the	right
thing	to	do	at	all.	Many	of	our	failures	in	performance	are	largely
attributable	to	a	lack	of	self-awareness.

One	of	our	greatest	challenges	in	changing	habits	is	maintaining
awareness	of	what	we	are	actually	doing.	This	helps	explain	why	the
consequences	of	bad	habits	can	sneak	up	on	us.	We	need	a	“point-and-
call”	system	for	our	personal	lives.	That’s	the	origin	of	the	Habits
Scorecard,	which	is	a	simple	exercise	you	can	use	to	become	more
aware	of	your	behavior.	To	create	your	own,	make	a	list	of	your	daily
habits.

Here’s	a	sample	of	where	your	list	might	start:

Wake	up

Turn	off	alarm

Check	my	phone

Go	to	the	bathroom

Weigh	myself

Take	a	shower

Brush	my	teeth

Floss	my	teeth

Put	on	deodorant

Hang	up	towel	to	dry

Get	dressed

Make	a	cup	of	tea

.	.	.	and	so	on.

Once	you	have	a	full	list,	look	at	each	behavior,	and	ask	yourself,	“Is
this	a	good	habit,	a	bad	habit,	or	a	neutral	habit?”	If	it	is	a	good	habit,
write	“+”	next	to	it.	If	it	is	a	bad	habit,	write	“–”.	If	it	is	a	neutral	habit,
write	“=”.

For	example,	the	list	above	might	look	like	this:

Wake	up	=

Turn	off	alarm	=

Check	my	phone	–

Go	to	the	bathroom	=

Weigh	myself	+

Take	a	shower	+

Brush	my	teeth	+

Floss	my	teeth	+

Put	on	deodorant	+

Hang	up	towel	to	dry	=

Get	dressed	=

Make	a	cup	of	tea	+

The	marks	you	give	to	a	particular	habit	will	depend	on	your
situation	and	your	goals.	For	someone	who	is	trying	to	lose	weight,
eating	a	bagel	with	peanut	butter	every	morning	might	be	a	bad	habit.
For	someone	who	is	trying	to	bulk	up	and	add	muscle,	the	same
behavior	might	be	a	good	habit.	It	all	depends	on	what	you’re	working
toward.*

Scoring	your	habits	can	be	a	bit	more	complex	for	another	reason	as

well.	The	labels	“good	habit”	and	“bad	habit”	are	slightly	inaccurate.
There	are	no	good	habits	or	bad	habits.	There	are	only	effective	habits.
That	is,	effective	at	solving	problems.	All	habits	serve	you	in	some	way
—even	the	bad	ones—which	is	why	you	repeat	them.	For	this	exercise,
categorize	your	habits	by	how	they	will	benefit	you	in	the	long	run.
Generally	speaking,	good	habits	will	have	net	positive	outcomes.	Bad
habits	have	net	negative	outcomes.	Smoking	a	cigarette	may	reduce
stress	right	now	(that’s	how	it’s	serving	you),	but	it’s	not	a	healthy
long-term	behavior.

If	you’re	still	having	trouble	determining	how	to	rate	a	particular

habit,	here	is	a	question	I	like	to	use:	“Does	this	behavior	help	me
become	the	type	of	person	I	wish	to	be?	Does	this	habit	cast	a	vote	for

or	against	my	desired	identity?”	Habits	that	reinforce	your	desired
identity	are	usually	good.	Habits	that	conflict	with	your	desired
identity	are	usually	bad.

As	you	create	your	Habits	Scorecard,	there	is	no	need	to	change
anything	at	first.	The	goal	is	to	simply	notice	what	is	actually	going	on.
Observe	your	thoughts	and	actions	without	judgment	or	internal
criticism.	Don’t	blame	yourself	for	your	faults.	Don’t	praise	yourself	for
your	successes.

If	you	eat	a	chocolate	bar	every	morning,	acknowledge	it,	almost	as

if	you	were	watching	someone	else.	Oh,	how	interesting	that	they
would	do	such	a	thing.	If	you	binge-eat,	simply	notice	that	you	are
eating	more	calories	than	you	should.	If	you	waste	time	online,	notice
that	you	are	spending	your	life	in	a	way	that	you	do	not	want	to.

The	first	step	to	changing	bad	habits	is	to	be	on	the	lookout	for
them.	If	you	feel	like	you	need	extra	help,	then	you	can	try	Pointing-
and-Calling	in	your	own	life.	Say	out	loud	the	action	that	you	are
thinking	of	taking	and	what	the	outcome	will	be.	If	you	want	to	cut
back	on	your	junk	food	habit	but	notice	yourself	grabbing	another
cookie,	say	out	loud,	“I’m	about	to	eat	this	cookie,	but	I	don’t	need	it.
Eating	it	will	cause	me	to	gain	weight	and	hurt	my	health.”

Hearing	your	bad	habits	spoken	aloud	makes	the	consequences

seem	more	real.	It	adds	weight	to	the	action	rather	than	letting
yourself	mindlessly	slip	into	an	old	routine.	This	approach	is	useful
even	if	you’re	simply	trying	to	remember	a	task	on	your	to-do	list.	Just
saying	out	loud,	“Tomorrow,	I	need	to	go	to	the	post	office	after	lunch,”
increases	the	odds	that	you’ll	actually	do	it.	You’re	getting	yourself	to
acknowledge	the	need	for	action—and	that	can	make	all	the	difference.

The	process	of	behavior	change	always	starts	with	awareness.
Strategies	like	Pointing-and-Calling	and	the	Habits	Scorecard	are
focused	on	getting	you	to	recognize	your	habits	and	acknowledge	the
cues	that	trigger	them,	which	makes	it	possible	to	respond	in	a	way
that	benefits	you.

Chapter	Summary

With	enough	practice,	your	brain	will	pick	up	on	the	cues	that
predict	certain	outcomes	without	consciously	thinking	about	it.

Once	our	habits	become	automatic,	we	stop	paying	attention	to
what	we	are	doing.

The	process	of	behavior	change	always	starts	with	awareness.	You
need	to	be	aware	of	your	habits	before	you	can	change	them.

Pointing-and-Calling	raises	your	level	of	awareness	from	a
nonconscious	habit	to	a	more	conscious	level	by	verbalizing	your

The	Best	Way	to	Start	a	New	Habit

I

N	2001,	RESEARCHERS	in	Great	Britain	began	working	with	248	people
to	build	better	exercise	habits	over	the	course	of	two	weeks.	The

subjects	were	divided	into	three	groups.

The	first	group	was	the	control	group.	They	were	simply	asked	to

track	how	often	they	exercised.

The	second	group	was	the	“motivation”	group.	They	were	asked	not

only	to	track	their	workouts	but	also	to	read	some	material	on	the
benefits	of	exercise.	The	researchers	also	explained	to	the	group	how
exercise	could	reduce	the	risk	of	coronary	heart	disease	and	improve
heart	health.

Finally,	there	was	the	third	group.	These	subjects	received	the	same

presentation	as	the	second	group,	which	ensured	that	they	had	equal
levels	of	motivation.	However,	they	were	also	asked	to	formulate	a	plan
for	when	and	where	they	would	exercise	over	the	following	week.
Specifically,	each	member	of	the	third	group	completed	the	following
sentence:	“During	the	next	week,	I	will	partake	in	at	least	20	minutes
of	vigorous	exercise	on	[DAY]	at	[TIME]	in	[PLACE].”

In	the	first	and	second	groups,	35	to	38	percent	of	people	exercised

at	least	once	per	week.	(Interestingly,	the	motivational	presentation
given	to	the	second	group	seemed	to	have	no	meaningful	impact	on
behavior.)	But	91	percent	of	the	third	group	exercised	at	least	once	per
week—more	than	double	the	normal	rate.

The	sentence	they	filled	out	is	what	researchers	refer	to	as	an

implementation	intention,	which	is	a	plan	you	make	beforehand	about

when	and	where	to	act.	That	is,	how	you	intend	to	implement	a
particular	habit.

The	cues	that	can	trigger	a	habit	come	in	a	wide	range	of	forms—the

feel	of	your	phone	buzzing	in	your	pocket,	the	smell	of	chocolate	chip
cookies,	the	sound	of	ambulance	sirens—but	the	two	most	common
cues	are	time	and	location.	Implementation	intentions	leverage	both	of
these	cues.

Broadly	speaking,	the	format	for	creating	an	implementation
intention	is:

“When	situation	X	arises,	I	will	perform	response	Y.”

Hundreds	of	studies	have	shown	that	implementation	intentions	are

effective	for	sticking	to	our	goals,	whether	it’s	writing	down	the	exact
time	and	date	of	when	you	will	get	a	flu	shot	or	recording	the	time	of
your	colonoscopy	appointment.	They	increase	the	odds	that	people	will
stick	with	habits	like	recycling,	studying,	going	to	sleep	early,	and
stopping	smoking.

Researchers	have	even	found	that	voter	turnout	increases	when
people	are	forced	to	create	implementation	intentions	by	answering
questions	like:	“What	route	are	you	taking	to	the	polling	station?	At
what	time	are	you	planning	to	go?	What	bus	will	get	you	there?”	Other
successful	government	programs	have	prompted	citizens	to	make	a
clear	plan	to	send	taxes	in	on	time	or	provided	directions	on	when	and
where	to	pay	late	traffic	bills.

The	punch	line	is	clear:	people	who	make	a	specific	plan	for	when

and	where	they	will	perform	a	new	habit	are	more	likely	to	follow
through.	Too	many	people	try	to	change	their	habits	without	these
basic	details	figured	out.	We	tell	ourselves,	“I’m	going	to	eat	healthier”
or	“I’m	going	to	write	more,”	but	we	never	say	when	and	where	these
habits	are	going	to	happen.	We	leave	it	up	to	chance	and	hope	that	we
will	“just	remember	to	do	it”	or	feel	motivated	at	the	right	time.	An
implementation	intention	sweeps	away	foggy	notions	like	“I	want	to
work	out	more”	or	“I	want	to	be	more	productive”	or	“I	should	vote”
and	transforms	them	into	a	concrete	plan	of	action.

Many	people	think	they	lack	motivation	when	what	they	really	lack
is	clarity.	It	is	not	always	obvious	when	and	where	to	take	action.	Some
people	spend	their	entire	lives	waiting	for	the	time	to	be	right	to	make
an	improvement.

Once	an	implementation	intention	has	been	set,	you	don’t	have	to
wait	for	inspiration	to	strike.	Do	I	write	a	chapter	today	or	not?	Do	I
meditate	this	morning	or	at	lunch?	When	the	moment	of	action
occurs,	there	is	no	need	to	make	a	decision.	Simply	follow	your
predetermined	plan.

The	simple	way	to	apply	this	strategy	to	your	habits	is	to	fill
out	this	sentence:

I	will	[BEHAVIOR]	at	[TIME]	in	[LOCATION].

Meditation.	I	will	meditate	for	one	minute	at	7	a.m.	in	my	kitchen.

Studying.	I	will	study	Spanish	for	twenty	minutes	at	6	p.m.	in	my
bedroom.

Exercise.	I	will	exercise	for	one	hour	at	5	p.m.	in	my	local	gym.

Marriage.	I	will	make	my	partner	a	cup	of	tea	at	8	a.m.	in	the
kitchen.

If	you	aren’t	sure	when	to	start	your	habit,	try	the	first	day	of	the
week,	month,	or	year.	People	are	more	likely	to	take	action	at	those
times	because	hope	is	usually	higher.	If	we	have	hope,	we	have	a
reason	to	take	action.	A	fresh	start	feels	motivating.

There	is	another	benefit	to	implementation	intentions.	Being

specific	about	what	you	want	and	how	you	will	achieve	it	helps	you	say
no	to	things	that	derail	progress,	distract	your	attention,	and	pull	you
off	course.	We	often	say	yes	to	little	requests	because	we	are	not	clear
enough	about	what	we	need	to	be	doing	instead.	When	your	dreams
are	vague,	it’s	easy	to	rationalize	little	exceptions	all	day	long	and	never
get	around	to	the	specific	things	you	need	to	do	to	succeed.

Give	your	habits	a	time	and	a	space	to	live	in	the	world.	The	goal	is
to	make	the	time	and	location	so	obvious	that,	with	enough	repetition,
you	get	an	urge	to	do	the	right	thing	at	the	right	time,	even	if	you	can’t
say	why.	As	the	writer	Jason	Zweig	noted,	“Obviously	you’re	never
going	to	just	work	out	without	conscious	thought.	But	like	a	dog
salivating	at	a	bell,	maybe	you	start	to	get	antsy	around	the	time	of	day
you	normally	work	out.”

There	are	many	ways	to	use	implementation	intentions	in	your	life

and	work.	My	favorite	approach	is	one	I	learned	from	Stanford
professor	BJ	Fogg	and	it	is	a	strategy	I	refer	to	as	habit	stacking.

HABIT	STACKING:	A	SIMPLE	PLAN	TO	OVERHAUL	YOUR
HABITS

The	French	philosopher	Denis	Diderot	lived	nearly	his	entire	life	in
poverty,	but	that	all	changed	one	day	in	1765.

Diderot’s	daughter	was	about	to	be	married	and	he	could	not	afford

to	pay	for	the	wedding.	Despite	his	lack	of	wealth,	Diderot	was	well
known	for	his	role	as	the	co-founder	and	writer	of	Encyclopédie,	one	of
the	most	comprehensive	encyclopedias	of	the	time.	When	Catherine
the	Great,	the	Empress	of	Russia,	heard	of	Diderot’s	financial	troubles,
her	heart	went	out	to	him.	She	was	a	book	lover	and	greatly	enjoyed	his
encyclopedia.	She	offered	to	buy	Diderot’s	personal	library	for	£1,000
—more	than	$150,000	today.*	Suddenly,	Diderot	had	money	to	spare.
With	his	new	wealth,	he	not	only	paid	for	the	wedding	but	also
acquired	a	scarlet	robe	for	himself.

Diderot’s	scarlet	robe	was	beautiful.	So	beautiful,	in	fact,	that	he
immediately	noticed	how	out	of	place	it	seemed	when	surrounded	by
his	more	common	possessions.	He	wrote	that	there	was	“no	more
coordination,	no	more	unity,	no	more	beauty”	between	his	elegant	robe
and	the	rest	of	his	stuff.

Diderot	soon	felt	the	urge	to	upgrade	his	possessions.	He	replaced

his	rug	with	one	from	Damascus.	He	decorated	his	home	with
expensive	sculptures.	He	bought	a	mirror	to	place	above	the	mantel,
and	a	better	kitchen	table.	He	tossed	aside	his	old	straw	chair	for	a
leather	one.	Like	falling	dominoes,	one	purchase	led	to	the	next.

Diderot’s	behavior	is	not	uncommon.	In	fact,	the	tendency	for	one

purchase	to	lead	to	another	one	has	a	name:	the	Diderot	Effect.	The
Diderot	Effect	states	that	obtaining	a	new	possession	often	creates	a
spiral	of	consumption	that	leads	to	additional	purchases.

You	can	spot	this	pattern	everywhere.	You	buy	a	dress	and	have	to
get	new	shoes	and	earrings	to	match.	You	buy	a	couch	and	suddenly
question	the	layout	of	your	entire	living	room.	You	buy	a	toy	for	your
child	and	soon	find	yourself	purchasing	all	of	the	accessories	that	go
with	it.	It’s	a	chain	reaction	of	purchases.

Many	human	behaviors	follow	this	cycle.	You	often	decide	what	to

do	next	based	on	what	you	have	just	finished	doing.	Going	to	the
bathroom	leads	to	washing	and	drying	your	hands,	which	reminds	you
that	you	need	to	put	the	dirty	towels	in	the	laundry,	so	you	add	laundry

detergent	to	the	shopping	list,	and	so	on.	No	behavior	happens	in
isolation.	Each	action	becomes	a	cue	that	triggers	the	next	behavior.

Why	is	this	important?

When	it	comes	to	building	new	habits,	you	can	use	the

connectedness	of	behavior	to	your	advantage.	One	of	the	best	ways	to
build	a	new	habit	is	to	identify	a	current	habit	you	already	do	each	day
and	then	stack	your	new	behavior	on	top.	This	is	called	habit	stacking.

Habit	stacking	is	a	special	form	of	an	implementation	intention.
Rather	than	pairing	your	new	habit	with	a	particular	time	and	location,
you	pair	it	with	a	current	habit.	This	method,	which	was	created	by	BJ
Fogg	as	part	of	his	Tiny	Habits	program,	can	be	used	to	design	an
obvious	cue	for	nearly	any	habit.*

The	habit	stacking	formula	is:

“After	[CURRENT	HABIT],	I	will	[NEW	HABIT].”

For	example:

Meditation.	After	I	pour	my	cup	of	coffee	each	morning,	I	will
meditate	for	one	minute.

Exercise.	After	I	take	off	my	work	shoes,	I	will	immediately
change	into	my	workout	clothes.

Gratitude.	After	I	sit	down	to	dinner,	I	will	say	one	thing	I’m
grateful	for	that	happened	today.

Marriage.	After	I	get	into	bed	at	night,	I	will	give	my	partner	a
kiss.

Safety.	After	I	put	on	my	running	shoes,	I	will	text	a	friend	or
family	member	where	I	am	running	and	how	long	it	will	take.

The	key	is	to	tie	your	desired	behavior	into	something	you	already

do	each	day.	Once	you	have	mastered	this	basic	structure,	you	can
begin	to	create	larger	stacks	by	chaining	small	habits	together.	This
allows	you	to	take	advantage	of	the	natural	momentum	that	comes
from	one	behavior	leading	into	the	next—a	positive	version	of	the
Diderot	Effect.

HABIT	STACKING

FIGURE	7:	Habit	stacking	increases	the	likelihood	that	you’ll	stick	with	a
habit	by	stacking	your	new	behavior	on	top	of	an	old	one.	This	process	can
be	repeated	to	chain	numerous	habits	together,	each	one	acting	as	the	cue
for	the	next.

Your	morning	routine	habit	stack	might	look	like	this:

1.	 After	I	pour	my	morning	cup	of	coffee,	I	will	meditate	for	sixty

seconds.

2.	 After	I	meditate	for	sixty	seconds,	I	will	write	my	to-do	list	for

the	day.

3.	 After	I	write	my	to-do	list	for	the	day,	I	will	immediately	begin

my	first	task.

Or,	consider	this	habit	stack	in	the	evening:

1.	 After	I	finish	eating	dinner,	I	will	put	my	plate	directly	into	the

dishwasher.

2.	 After	I	put	my	dishes	away,	I	will	immediately	wipe	down	the

counter.

3.	 After	I	wipe	down	the	counter,	I	will	set	out	my	coffee	mug	for

tomorrow	morning.

You	can	also	insert	new	behaviors	into	the	middle	of	your	current
routines.	For	example,	you	may	already	have	a	morning	routine	that
looks	like	this:	Wake	up	>	Make	my	bed	>	Take	a	shower.	Let’s	say	you
want	to	develop	the	habit	of	reading	more	each	night.	You	can	expand
your	habit	stack	and	try	something	like:	Wake	up	>	Make	my	bed	>
Place	a	book	on	my	pillow	>	Take	a	shower.	Now,	when	you	climb	into
bed	each	night,	a	book	will	be	sitting	there	waiting	for	you	to	enjoy.

Overall,	habit	stacking	allows	you	to	create	a	set	of	simple	rules	that

guide	your	future	behavior.	It’s	like	you	always	have	a	game	plan	for
which	action	should	come	next.	Once	you	get	comfortable	with	this
approach,	you	can	develop	general	habit	stacks	to	guide	you	whenever
the	situation	is	appropriate:

Exercise.	When	I	see	a	set	of	stairs,	I	will	take	them	instead	of
using	the	elevator.

Social	skills.	When	I	walk	into	a	party,	I	will	introduce	myself	to
someone	I	don’t	know	yet.

Finances.	When	I	want	to	buy	something	over	$100,	I	will	wait
twenty-four	hours	before	purchasing.

Healthy	eating.	When	I	serve	myself	a	meal,	I	will	always	put
veggies	on	my	plate	first.

Minimalism.	When	I	buy	a	new	item,	I	will	give	something	away.
(“One	in,	one	out.”)

Mood.	When	the	phone	rings,	I	will	take	one	deep	breath	and
smile	before	answering.

Forgetfulness.	When	I	leave	a	public	place,	I	will	check	the	table
and	chairs	to	make	sure	I	don’t	leave	anything	behind.

No	matter	how	you	use	this	strategy,	the	secret	to	creating	a
successful	habit	stack	is	selecting	the	right	cue	to	kick	things	off.
Unlike	an	implementation	intention,	which	specifically	states	the	time
and	location	for	a	given	behavior,	habit	stacking	implicitly	has	the	time
and	location	built	into	it.	When	and	where	you	choose	to	insert	a	habit
into	your	daily	routine	can	make	a	big	difference.	If	you’re	trying	to
add	meditation	into	your	morning	routine	but	mornings	are	chaotic
and	your	kids	keep	running	into	the	room,	then	that	may	be	the	wrong
place	and	time.	Consider	when	you	are	most	likely	to	be	successful.
Don’t	ask	yourself	to	do	a	habit	when	you’re	likely	to	be	occupied	with
something	else.

Your	cue	should	also	have	the	same	frequency	as	your	desired	habit.

If	you	want	to	do	a	habit	every	day,	but	you	stack	it	on	top	of	a	habit
that	only	happens	on	Mondays,	that’s	not	a	good	choice.

One	way	to	find	the	right	trigger	for	your	habit	stack	is	by

brainstorming	a	list	of	your	current	habits.	You	can	use	your	Habits
Scorecard	from	the	last	chapter	as	a	starting	point.	Alternatively,	you
can	create	a	list	with	two	columns.	In	the	first	column,	write	down	the
habits	you	do	each	day	without	fail.*

For	example:

Get	out	of	bed.

Take	a	shower.

Brush	your	teeth.

Get	dressed.

Brew	a	cup	of	coffee.

Eat	breakfast.

Take	the	kids	to	school.

Start	the	work	day.

Eat	lunch.

End	the	work	day.

Change	out	of	work	clothes.

Sit	down	for	dinner.

Turn	off	the	lights.

Get	into	bed.

Your	list	can	be	much	longer,	but	you	get	the	idea.	In	the	second

column,	write	down	all	of	the	things	that	happen	to	you	each	day
without	fail.	For	example:

The	sun	rises.

You	get	a	text	message.

The	song	you	are	listening	to	ends.

The	sun	sets.

Armed	with	these	two	lists,	you	can	begin	searching	for	the	best

place	to	layer	your	new	habit	into	your	lifestyle.

Habit	stacking	works	best	when	the	cue	is	highly	specific	and

immediately	actionable.	Many	people	select	cues	that	are	too	vague.	I
made	this	mistake	myself.	When	I	wanted	to	start	a	push-up	habit,	my
habit	stack	was	“When	I	take	a	break	for	lunch,	I	will	do	ten	push-ups.”
At	first	glance,	this	sounded	reasonable.	But	soon,	I	realized	the	trigger
was	unclear.	Would	I	do	my	push-ups	before	I	ate	lunch?	After	I	ate
lunch?	Where	would	I	do	them?	After	a	few	inconsistent	days,	I
changed	my	habit	stack	to:	“When	I	close	my	laptop	for	lunch,	I	will	do
ten	push-ups	next	to	my	desk.”	Ambiguity	gone.

Habits	like	“read	more”	or	“eat	better”	are	worthy	causes,	but	these

goals	do	not	provide	instruction	on	how	and	when	to	act.	Be	specific
and	clear:	After	I	close	the	door.	After	I	brush	my	teeth.	After	I	sit
down	at	the	table.	The	specificity	is	important.	The	more	tightly	bound
your	new	habit	is	to	a	specific	cue,	the	better	the	odds	are	that	you	will
notice	when	the	time	comes	to	act.

The	1st	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	to	make	it	obvious.	Strategies
like	implementation	intentions	and	habit	stacking	are	among	the	most
practical	ways	to	create	obvious	cues	for	your	habits	and	design	a	clear
plan	for	when	and	where	to	take	action.

Motivation	Is	Overrated;	Environment
Often	Matters	More

ANNE	THORNDIKE,	A	primary	care	physician	at	Massachusetts	General
Hospital	in	Boston,	had	a	crazy	idea.	She	believed	she	could	improve
the	eating	habits	of	thousands	of	hospital	staff	and	visitors	without
changing	their	willpower	or	motivation	in	the	slightest	way.	In	fact,	she
didn’t	plan	on	talking	to	them	at	all.

Thorndike	and	her	colleagues	designed	a	six-month	study	to	alter

the	“choice	architecture”	of	the	hospital	cafeteria.	They	started	by
changing	how	drinks	were	arranged	in	the	room.	Originally,	the
refrigerators	located	next	to	the	cash	registers	in	the	cafeteria	were
filled	with	only	soda.	The	researchers	added	water	as	an	option	to	each
one.	Additionally,	they	placed	baskets	of	bottled	water	next	to	the	food
stations	throughout	the	room.	Soda	was	still	in	the	primary
refrigerators,	but	water	was	now	available	at	all	drink	locations.

Over	the	next	three	months,	the	number	of	soda	sales	at	the	hospital

dropped	by	11.4	percent.	Meanwhile,	sales	of	bottled	water	increased
by	25.8	percent.	They	made	similar	adjustments—and	saw	similar
results—with	the	food	in	the	cafeteria.	Nobody	had	said	a	word	to
anyone	eating	there.

BEFORE

AFTER

FIGURE	8:	Here	is	a	representation	of	what	the	cafeteria	looked	like	before
the	environment	design	changes	were	made	(left)	and	after	(right).	The
shaded	boxes	indicate	areas	where	bottled	water	was	available	in	each
instance.	Because	the	amount	of	water	in	the	environment	was	increased,
behavior	shifted	naturally	and	without	additional	motivation.

People	often	choose	products	not	because	of	what	they	are,	but
because	of	where	they	are.	If	I	walk	into	the	kitchen	and	see	a	plate	of
cookies	on	the	counter,	I’ll	pick	up	half	a	dozen	and	start	eating,	even	if
I	hadn’t	been	thinking	about	them	beforehand	and	didn’t	necessarily
feel	hungry.	If	the	communal	table	at	the	office	is	always	filled	with
doughnuts	and	bagels,	it’s	going	to	be	hard	not	to	grab	one	every	now
and	then.	Your	habits	change	depending	on	the	room	you	are	in	and
the	cues	in	front	of	you.

Environment	is	the	invisible	hand	that	shapes	human	behavior.
Despite	our	unique	personalities,	certain	behaviors	tend	to	arise	again
and	again	under	certain	environmental	conditions.	In	church,	people
tend	to	talk	in	whispers.	On	a	dark	street,	people	act	wary	and	guarded.
In	this	way,	the	most	common	form	of	change	is	not	internal,	but
external:	we	are	changed	by	the	world	around	us.	Every	habit	is
context	dependent.

In	1936,	psychologist	Kurt	Lewin	wrote	a	simple	equation	that
makes	a	powerful	statement:	Behavior	is	a	function	of	the	Person	in
their	Environment,	or	B	=	f	(P,E).

It	didn’t	take	long	for	Lewin’s	Equation	to	be	tested	in	business.	In
1952,	the	economist	Hawkins	Stern	described	a	phenomenon	he	called
Suggestion	Impulse	Buying,	which	“is	triggered	when	a	shopper	sees	a
product	for	the	first	time	and	visualizes	a	need	for	it.”	In	other	words,
customers	will	occasionally	buy	products	not	because	they	want	them
but	because	of	how	they	are	presented	to	them.

For	example,	items	at	eye	level	tend	to	be	purchased	more	than
those	down	near	the	floor.	For	this	reason,	you’ll	find	expensive	brand
names	featured	in	easy-to-reach	locations	on	store	shelves	because
they	drive	the	most	profit,	while	cheaper	alternatives	are	tucked	away
in	harder-to-reach	spots.	The	same	goes	for	end	caps,	which	are	the
units	at	the	end	of	aisles.	End	caps	are	moneymaking	machines	for
retailers	because	they	are	obvious	locations	that	encounter	a	lot	of	foot
traffic.	For	example,	45	percent	of	Coca-Cola	sales	come	specifically
from	end-of-the-aisle	racks.

The	more	obviously	available	a	product	or	service	is,	the	more	likely

you	are	to	try	it.	People	drink	Bud	Light	because	it	is	in	every	bar	and
visit	Starbucks	because	it	is	on	every	corner.	We	like	to	think	that	we
are	in	control.	If	we	choose	water	over	soda,	we	assume	it	is	because
we	wanted	to	do	so.	The	truth,	however,	is	that	many	of	the	actions	we
take	each	day	are	shaped	not	by	purposeful	drive	and	choice	but	by	the
most	obvious	option.

Every	living	being	has	its	own	methods	for	sensing	and

understanding	the	world.	Eagles	have	remarkable	long-distance	vision.
Snakes	can	smell	by	“tasting	the	air”	with	their	highly	sensitive
tongues.	Sharks	can	detect	small	amounts	of	electricity	and	vibrations
in	the	water	caused	by	nearby	fish.	Even	bacteria	have	chemoreceptors
—tiny	sensory	cells	that	allow	them	to	detect	toxic	chemicals	in	their
environment.

In	humans,	perception	is	directed	by	the	sensory	nervous	system.
We	perceive	the	world	through	sight,	sound,	smell,	touch,	and	taste.
But	we	also	have	other	ways	of	sensing	stimuli.	Some	are	conscious,
but	many	are	nonconscious.	For	instance,	you	can	“notice”	when	the
temperature	drops	before	a	storm,	or	when	the	pain	in	your	gut	rises
during	a	stomachache,	or	when	you	fall	off	balance	while	walking	on
rocky	ground.	Receptors	in	your	body	pick	up	on	a	wide	range	of
internal	stimuli,	such	as	the	amount	of	salt	in	your	blood	or	the	need	to
drink	when	thirsty.

The	most	powerful	of	all	human	sensory	abilities,	however,	is	vision.

The	human	body	has	about	eleven	million	sensory	receptors.
Approximately	ten	million	of	those	are	dedicated	to	sight.	Some
experts	estimate	that	half	of	the	brain’s	resources	are	used	on	vision.
Given	that	we	are	more	dependent	on	vision	than	on	any	other	sense,	it
should	come	as	no	surprise	that	visual	cues	are	the	greatest	catalyst	of
our	behavior.	For	this	reason,	a	small	change	in	what	you	see	can	lead
to	a	big	shift	in	what	you	do.	As	a	result,	you	can	imagine	how
important	it	is	to	live	and	work	in	environments	that	are	filled	with
productive	cues	and	devoid	of	unproductive	ones.

Thankfully,	there	is	good	news	in	this	respect.	You	don’t	have	to	be

the	victim	of	your	environment.	You	can	also	be	the	architect	of	it.

HOW	TO	DESIGN	YOUR	ENVIRONMENT	FOR	SUCCESS

During	the	energy	crisis	and	oil	embargo	of	the	1970s,	Dutch
researchers	began	to	pay	close	attention	to	the	country’s	energy	usage.
In	one	suburb	near	Amsterdam,	they	found	that	some	homeowners
used	30	percent	less	energy	than	their	neighbors—despite	the	homes
being	of	similar	size	and	getting	electricity	for	the	same	price.

It	turned	out	the	houses	in	this	neighborhood	were	nearly	identical

except	for	one	feature:	the	location	of	the	electrical	meter.	Some	had
one	in	the	basement.	Others	had	the	electrical	meter	upstairs	in	the
main	hallway.	As	you	may	guess,	the	homes	with	the	meters	located	in
the	main	hallway	used	less	electricity.	When	their	energy	use	was
obvious	and	easy	to	track,	people	changed	their	behavior.

Every	habit	is	initiated	by	a	cue,	and	we	are	more	likely	to	notice
cues	that	stand	out.	Unfortunately,	the	environments	where	we	live
and	work	often	make	it	easy	not	to	do	certain	actions	because	there	is
no	obvious	cue	to	trigger	the	behavior.	It’s	easy	not	to	practice	the
guitar	when	it’s	tucked	away	in	the	closet.	It’s	easy	not	to	read	a	book
when	the	bookshelf	is	in	the	corner	of	the	guest	room.	It’s	easy	not	to
take	your	vitamins	when	they	are	out	of	sight	in	the	pantry.	When	the
cues	that	spark	a	habit	are	subtle	or	hidden,	they	are	easy	to	ignore.

By	comparison,	creating	obvious	visual	cues	can	draw	your

attention	toward	a	desired	habit.	In	the	early	1990s,	the	cleaning	staff
at	Schiphol	Airport	in	Amsterdam	installed	a	small	sticker	that	looked
like	a	fly	near	the	center	of	each	urinal.	Apparently,	when	men	stepped

up	to	the	urinals,	they	aimed	for	what	they	thought	was	a	bug.	The
stickers	improved	their	aim	and	significantly	reduced	“spillage”	around
the	urinals.	Further	analysis	determined	that	the	stickers	cut	bathroom
cleaning	costs	by	8	percent	per	year.

I’ve	experienced	the	power	of	obvious	cues	in	my	own	life.	I	used	to
buy	apples	from	the	store,	put	them	in	the	crisper	in	the	bottom	of	the
refrigerator,	and	forget	all	about	them.	By	the	time	I	remembered,	the
apples	would	have	gone	bad.	I	never	saw	them,	so	I	never	ate	them.

Eventually,	I	took	my	own	advice	and	redesigned	my	environment.	I

bought	a	large	display	bowl	and	placed	it	in	the	middle	of	the	kitchen
counter.	The	next	time	I	bought	apples,	that	was	where	they	went—out
in	the	open	where	I	could	see	them.	Almost	like	magic,	I	began	eating	a
few	apples	each	day	simply	because	they	were	obvious	rather	than	out
of	sight.

Here	are	a	few	ways	you	can	redesign	your	environment	and	make

the	cues	for	your	preferred	habits	more	obvious:

If	you	want	to	remember	to	take	your	medication	each	night,	put
your	pill	bottle	directly	next	to	the	faucet	on	the	bathroom
counter.

If	you	want	to	practice	guitar	more	frequently,	place	your	guitar
stand	in	the	middle	of	the	living	room.

If	you	want	to	remember	to	send	more	thank-you	notes,	keep	a
stack	of	stationery	on	your	desk.

If	you	want	to	drink	more	water,	fill	up	a	few	water	bottles	each
morning	and	place	them	in	common	locations	around	the	house.

If	you	want	to	make	a	habit	a	big	part	of	your	life,	make	the	cue	a	big

part	of	your	environment.	The	most	persistent	behaviors	usually	have
multiple	cues.	Consider	how	many	different	ways	a	smoker	could	be
prompted	to	pull	out	a	cigarette:	driving	in	the	car,	seeing	a	friend
smoke,	feeling	stressed	at	work,	and	so	on.

The	same	strategy	can	be	employed	for	good	habits.	By	sprinkling

triggers	throughout	your	surroundings,	you	increase	the	odds	that
you’ll	think	about	your	habit	throughout	the	day.	Make	sure	the	best
choice	is	the	most	obvious	one.	Making	a	better	decision	is	easy	and
natural	when	the	cues	for	good	habits	are	right	in	front	of	you.

Environment	design	is	powerful	not	only	because	it	influences	how
we	engage	with	the	world	but	also	because	we	rarely	do	it.	Most	people
live	in	a	world	others	have	created	for	them.	But	you	can	alter	the
spaces	where	you	live	and	work	to	increase	your	exposure	to	positive
cues	and	reduce	your	exposure	to	negative	ones.	Environment	design
allows	you	to	take	back	control	and	become	the	architect	of	your	life.
Be	the	designer	of	your	world	and	not	merely	the	consumer	of	it.

THE	CONTEXT	IS	THE	CUE

The	cues	that	trigger	a	habit	can	start	out	very	specific,	but	over	time
your	habits	become	associated	not	with	a	single	trigger	but	with	the
entire	context	surrounding	the	behavior.

For	example,	many	people	drink	more	in	social	situations	than	they
would	ever	drink	alone.	The	trigger	is	rarely	a	single	cue,	but	rather	the
whole	situation:	watching	your	friends	order	drinks,	hearing	the	music
at	the	bar,	seeing	the	beers	on	tap.

We	mentally	assign	our	habits	to	the	locations	in	which	they	occur:
the	home,	the	office,	the	gym.	Each	location	develops	a	connection	to
certain	habits	and	routines.	You	establish	a	particular	relationship	with
the	objects	on	your	desk,	the	items	on	your	kitchen	counter,	the	things
in	your	bedroom.

Our	behavior	is	not	defined	by	the	objects	in	the	environment	but	by
our	relationship	to	them.	In	fact,	this	is	a	useful	way	to	think	about	the
influence	of	the	environment	on	your	behavior.	Stop	thinking	about
your	environment	as	filled	with	objects.	Start	thinking	about	it	as	filled
with	relationships.	Think	in	terms	of	how	you	interact	with	the	spaces
around	you.	For	one	person,	her	couch	is	the	place	where	she	reads	for
an	hour	each	night.	For	someone	else,	the	couch	is	where	he	watches
television	and	eats	a	bowl	of	ice	cream	after	work.	Different	people	can
have	different	memories—and	thus	different	habits—associated	with
the	same	place.

The	good	news?	You	can	train	yourself	to	link	a	particular	habit	with

a	particular	context.

In	one	study,	scientists	instructed	insomniacs	to	get	into	bed	only
when	they	were	tired.	If	they	couldn’t	fall	asleep,	they	were	told	to	sit
in	a	different	room	until	they	became	sleepy.	Over	time,	subjects	began

to	associate	the	context	of	their	bed	with	the	action	of	sleeping,	and	it
became	easier	to	quickly	fall	asleep	when	they	climbed	in	bed.	Their
brains	learned	that	sleeping—not	browsing	on	their	phones,	not
watching	television,	not	staring	at	the	clock—was	the	only	action	that
happened	in	that	room.

The	power	of	context	also	reveals	an	important	strategy:	habits	can
be	easier	to	change	in	a	new	environment.	It	helps	to	escape	the	subtle
triggers	and	cues	that	nudge	you	toward	your	current	habits.	Go	to	a
new	place—a	different	coffee	shop,	a	bench	in	the	park,	a	corner	of
your	room	you	seldom	use—and	create	a	new	routine	there.

It	is	easier	to	associate	a	new	habit	with	a	new	context	than	to	build

a	new	habit	in	the	face	of	competing	cues.	It	can	be	difficult	to	go	to
bed	early	if	you	watch	television	in	your	bedroom	each	night.	It	can	be
hard	to	study	in	the	living	room	without	getting	distracted	if	that’s
where	you	always	play	video	games.	But	when	you	step	outside	your
normal	environment,	you	leave	your	behavioral	biases	behind.	You
aren’t	battling	old	environmental	cues,	which	allows	new	habits	to
form	without	interruption.

Want	to	think	more	creatively?	Move	to	a	bigger	room,	a	rooftop
patio,	or	a	building	with	expansive	architecture.	Take	a	break	from	the
space	where	you	do	your	daily	work,	which	is	also	linked	to	your
current	thought	patterns.

Trying	to	eat	healthier?	It	is	likely	that	you	shop	on	autopilot	at	your
regular	supermarket.	Try	a	new	grocery	store.	You	may	find	it	easier	to
avoid	unhealthy	food	when	your	brain	doesn’t	automatically	know
where	it	is	located	in	the	store.

When	you	can’t	manage	to	get	to	an	entirely	new	environment,
redefine	or	rearrange	your	current	one.	Create	a	separate	space	for
work,	study,	exercise,	entertainment,	and	cooking.	The	mantra	I	find
useful	is	“One	space,	one	use.”

When	I	started	my	career	as	an	entrepreneur,	I	would	often	work
from	my	couch	or	at	the	kitchen	table.	In	the	evenings,	I	found	it	very
difficult	to	stop	working.	There	was	no	clear	division	between	the	end
of	work	time	and	the	beginning	of	personal	time.	Was	the	kitchen	table
my	office	or	the	space	where	I	ate	meals?	Was	the	couch	where	I
relaxed	or	where	I	sent	emails?	Everything	happened	in	the	same
place.

A	few	years	later,	I	could	finally	afford	to	move	to	a	home	with	a

separate	room	for	my	office.	Suddenly,	work	was	something	that
happened	“in	here”	and	personal	life	was	something	that	happened
“out	there.”	It	was	easier	for	me	to	turn	off	the	professional	side	of	my
brain	when	there	was	a	clear	dividing	line	between	work	life	and	home
life.	Each	room	had	one	primary	use.	The	kitchen	was	for	cooking.	The
office	was	for	working.

Whenever	possible,	avoid	mixing	the	context	of	one	habit	with
another.	When	you	start	mixing	contexts,	you’ll	start	mixing	habits—
and	the	easier	ones	will	usually	win	out.	This	is	one	reason	why	the
versatility	of	modern	technology	is	both	a	strength	and	a	weakness.
You	can	use	your	phone	for	all	sorts	of	tasks,	which	makes	it	a
powerful	device.	But	when	you	can	use	your	phone	to	do	nearly
anything,	it	becomes	hard	to	associate	it	with	one	task.	You	want	to	be
productive,	but	you’re	also	conditioned	to	browse	social	media,	check
email,	and	play	video	games	whenever	you	open	your	phone.	It’s	a
mishmash	of	cues.

You	may	be	thinking,	“You	don’t	understand.	I	live	in	New	York
City.	My	apartment	is	the	size	of	a	smartphone.	I	need	each	room	to
play	multiple	roles.”	Fair	enough.	If	your	space	is	limited,	divide	your
room	into	activity	zones:	a	chair	for	reading,	a	desk	for	writing,	a	table
for	eating.	You	can	do	the	same	with	your	digital	spaces.	I	know	a
writer	who	uses	his	computer	only	for	writing,	his	tablet	only	for
reading,	and	his	phone	only	for	social	media	and	texting.	Every	habit
should	have	a	home.

If	you	can	manage	to	stick	with	this	strategy,	each	context	will

become	associated	with	a	particular	habit	and	mode	of	thought.	Habits
thrive	under	predictable	circumstances	like	these.	Focus	comes
automatically	when	you	are	sitting	at	your	work	desk.	Relaxation	is
easier	when	you	are	in	a	space	designed	for	that	purpose.	Sleep	comes
quickly	when	it	is	the	only	thing	that	happens	in	your	bedroom.	If	you
want	behaviors	that	are	stable	and	predictable,	you	need	an
environment	that	is	stable	and	predictable.

A	stable	environment	where	everything	has	a	place	and	a	purpose	is

an	environment	where	habits	can	easily	form.

Chapter	Summary

Small	changes	in	context	can	lead	to	large	changes	in	behavior
over	time.

Every	habit	is	initiated	by	a	cue.	We	are	more	likely	to	notice	cues
that	stand	out.

Make	the	cues	of	good	habits	obvious	in	your	environment.

Gradually,	your	habits	become	associated	not	with	a	single	trigger
but	with	the	entire	context	surrounding	the	behavior.	The	context
becomes	the	cue.

It	is	easier	to	build	new	habits	in	a	new	environment	because	you
are	not	fighting	against	old	cues.

7

The	Secret	to	Self-Control

I

N	1971,	as	the	Vietnam	War	was	heading	into	its	sixteenth	year,
congressmen	Robert	Steele	from	Connecticut	and	Morgan	Murphy

from	Illinois	made	a	discovery	that	stunned	the	American	public.
While	visiting	the	troops,	they	had	learned	that	over	15	percent	of	U.S.
soldiers	stationed	there	were	heroin	addicts.	Follow-up	research
revealed	that	35	percent	of	service	members	in	Vietnam	had	tried
heroin	and	as	many	as	20	percent	were	addicted—the	problem	was
even	worse	than	they	had	initially	thought.

The	discovery	led	to	a	flurry	of	activity	in	Washington,	including	the

creation	of	the	Special	Action	Office	of	Drug	Abuse	Prevention	under
President	Nixon	to	promote	prevention	and	rehabilitation	and	to	track
addicted	service	members	when	they	returned	home.

Lee	Robins	was	one	of	the	researchers	in	charge.	In	a	finding	that

completely	upended	the	accepted	beliefs	about	addiction,	Robins
found	that	when	soldiers	who	had	been	heroin	users	returned	home,
only	5	percent	of	them	became	re-addicted	within	a	year,	and	just	12
percent	relapsed	within	three	years.	In	other	words,	approximately
nine	out	of	ten	soldiers	who	used	heroin	in	Vietnam	eliminated	their
addiction	nearly	overnight.

This	finding	contradicted	the	prevailing	view	at	the	time,	which

considered	heroin	addiction	to	be	a	permanent	and	irreversible
condition.	Instead,	Robins	revealed	that	addictions	could
spontaneously	dissolve	if	there	was	a	radical	change	in	the
environment.	In	Vietnam,	soldiers	spent	all	day	surrounded	by	cues
triggering	heroin	use:	it	was	easy	to	access,	they	were	engulfed	by	the
constant	stress	of	war,	they	built	friendships	with	fellow	soldiers	who

were	also	heroin	users,	and	they	were	thousands	of	miles	from	home.
Once	a	soldier	returned	to	the	United	States,	though,	he	found	himself
in	an	environment	devoid	of	those	triggers.	When	the	context	changed,
so	did	the	habit.

Compare	this	situation	to	that	of	a	typical	drug	user.	Someone
becomes	addicted	at	home	or	with	friends,	goes	to	a	clinic	to	get	clean
—which	is	devoid	of	all	the	environmental	stimuli	that	prompt	their
habit—then	returns	to	their	old	neighborhood	with	all	of	their	previous
cues	that	caused	them	to	get	addicted	in	the	first	place.	It’s	no	wonder
that	usually	you	see	numbers	that	are	the	exact	opposite	of	those	in	the
Vietnam	study.	Typically,	90	percent	of	heroin	users	become	re-
addicted	once	they	return	home	from	rehab.

The	Vietnam	studies	ran	counter	to	many	of	our	cultural	beliefs
about	bad	habits	because	it	challenged	the	conventional	association	of
unhealthy	behavior	as	a	moral	weakness.	If	you’re	overweight,	a
smoker,	or	an	addict,	you’ve	been	told	your	entire	life	that	it	is	because
you	lack	self-control—maybe	even	that	you’re	a	bad	person.	The	idea
that	a	little	bit	of	discipline	would	solve	all	our	problems	is	deeply
embedded	in	our	culture.

Recent	research,	however,	shows	something	different.	When

scientists	analyze	people	who	appear	to	have	tremendous	self-control,
it	turns	out	those	individuals	aren’t	all	that	different	from	those	who
are	struggling.	Instead,	“disciplined”	people	are	better	at	structuring
their	lives	in	a	way	that	does	not	require	heroic	willpower	and	self-
control.	In	other	words,	they	spend	less	time	in	tempting	situations.

The	people	with	the	best	self-control	are	typically	the	ones	who	need

to	use	it	the	least.	It’s	easier	to	practice	self-restraint	when	you	don’t
have	to	use	it	very	often.	So,	yes,	perseverance,	grit,	and	willpower	are
essential	to	success,	but	the	way	to	improve	these	qualities	is	not	by
wishing	you	were	a	more	disciplined	person,	but	by	creating	a	more
disciplined	environment.

This	counterintuitive	idea	makes	even	more	sense	once	you

understand	what	happens	when	a	habit	is	formed	in	the	brain.	A	habit
that	has	been	encoded	in	the	mind	is	ready	to	be	used	whenever	the
relevant	situation	arises.	When	Patty	Olwell,	a	therapist	from	Austin,
Texas,	started	smoking,	she	would	often	light	up	while	riding	horses
with	a	friend.	Eventually,	she	quit	smoking	and	avoided	it	for	years.
She	had	also	stopped	riding.	Decades	later,	she	hopped	on	a	horse

again	and	found	herself	craving	a	cigarette	for	the	first	time	in	forever.
The	cues	were	still	internalized;	she	just	hadn’t	been	exposed	to	them
in	a	long	time.

Once	a	habit	has	been	encoded,	the	urge	to	act	follows	whenever	the

environmental	cues	reappear.	This	is	one	reason	behavior	change
techniques	can	backfire.	Shaming	obese	people	with	weight-loss
presentations	can	make	them	feel	stressed,	and	as	a	result	many
people	return	to	their	favorite	coping	strategy:	overeating.	Showing
pictures	of	blackened	lungs	to	smokers	leads	to	higher	levels	of
anxiety,	which	drives	many	people	to	reach	for	a	cigarette.	If	you’re	not
careful	about	cues,	you	can	cause	the	very	behavior	you	want	to	stop.

Bad	habits	are	autocatalytic:	the	process	feeds	itself.	They	foster	the

feelings	they	try	to	numb.	You	feel	bad,	so	you	eat	junk	food.	Because
you	eat	junk	food,	you	feel	bad.	Watching	television	makes	you	feel
sluggish,	so	you	watch	more	television	because	you	don’t	have	the
energy	to	do	anything	else.	Worrying	about	your	health	makes	you	feel
anxious,	which	causes	you	to	smoke	to	ease	your	anxiety,	which	makes
your	health	even	worse	and	soon	you’re	feeling	more	anxious.	It’s	a
downward	spiral,	a	runaway	train	of	bad	habits.

Researchers	refer	to	this	phenomenon	as	“cue-induced	wanting”:	an

external	trigger	causes	a	compulsive	craving	to	repeat	a	bad	habit.
Once	you	notice	something,	you	begin	to	want	it.	This	process	is
happening	all	the	time—often	without	us	realizing	it.	Scientists	have
found	that	showing	addicts	a	picture	of	cocaine	for	just	thirty-three
milliseconds	stimulates	the	reward	pathway	in	the	brain	and	sparks
desire.	This	speed	is	too	fast	for	the	brain	to	consciously	register—the
addicts	couldn’t	even	tell	you	what	they	had	seen—but	they	craved	the
drug	all	the	same.

Here’s	the	punch	line:	You	can	break	a	habit,	but	you’re	unlikely	to
forget	it.	Once	the	mental	grooves	of	habit	have	been	carved	into	your
brain,	they	are	nearly	impossible	to	remove	entirely—even	if	they	go
unused	for	quite	a	while.	And	that	means	that	simply	resisting
temptation	is	an	ineffective	strategy.	It	is	hard	to	maintain	a	Zen
attitude	in	a	life	filled	with	interruptions.	It	takes	too	much	energy.	In
the	short-run,	you	can	choose	to	overpower	temptation.	In	the	long-
run,	we	become	a	product	of	the	environment	that	we	live	in.	To	put	it
bluntly,	I	have	never	seen	someone	consistently	stick	to	positive	habits
in	a	negative	environment.

A	more	reliable	approach	is	to	cut	bad	habits	off	at	the	source.	One

of	the	most	practical	ways	to	eliminate	a	bad	habit	is	to	reduce
exposure	to	the	cue	that	causes	it.

If	you	can’t	seem	to	get	any	work	done,	leave	your	phone	in
another	room	for	a	few	hours.

If	you’re	continually	feeling	like	you’re	not	enough,	stop	following
social	media	accounts	that	trigger	jealousy	and	envy.

If	you’re	wasting	too	much	time	watching	television,	move	the	TV
out	of	the	bedroom.

If	you’re	spending	too	much	money	on	electronics,	quit	reading
reviews	of	the	latest	tech	gear.

If	you’re	playing	too	many	video	games,	unplug	the	console	and
put	it	in	a	closet	after	each	use.

This	practice	is	an	inversion	of	the	1st	Law	of	Behavior	Change.
Rather	than	make	it	obvious,	you	can	make	it	invisible.	I’m	often
surprised	by	how	effective	simple	changes	like	these	can	be.	Remove	a
single	cue	and	the	entire	habit	often	fades	away.

Self-control	is	a	short-term	strategy,	not	a	long-term	one.	You	may

be	able	to	resist	temptation	once	or	twice,	but	it’s	unlikely	you	can
muster	the	willpower	to	override	your	desires	every	time.	Instead	of
summoning	a	new	dose	of	willpower	whenever	you	want	to	do	the	right
thing,	your	energy	would	be	better	spent	optimizing	your	environment.
This	is	the	secret	to	self-control.	Make	the	cues	of	your	good	habits
obvious	and	the	cues	of	your	bad	habits	invisible.

Chapter	Summary

The	inversion	of	the	1st	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	make	it
invisible.

Once	a	habit	is	formed,	it	is	unlikely	to	be	forgotten.

People	with	high	self-control	tend	to	spend	less	time	in	tempting
situations.	It’s	easier	to	avoid	temptation	than	resist	it.

One	of	the	most	practical	ways	to	eliminate	a	bad	habit	is	to
reduce	exposure	to	the	cue	that	causes	it.

Self-control	is	a	short-term	strategy,	not	a	long-term	one.

How	to	Make	a	Habit	Irresistible

I

N	THE	1940S,	a	Dutch	scientist	named	Niko	Tinbergen	performed	a
series	of	experiments	that	transformed	our	understanding	of	what

motivates	us.	Tinbergen—who	eventually	won	a	Nobel	Prize	for	his
work—was	investigating	herring	gulls,	the	gray	and	white	birds	often
seen	flying	along	the	seashores	of	North	America.

Adult	herring	gulls	have	a	small	red	dot	on	their	beak,	and
Tinbergen	noticed	that	newly	hatched	chicks	would	peck	this	spot
whenever	they	wanted	food.	To	begin	one	experiment,	he	created	a
collection	of	fake	cardboard	beaks,	just	a	head	without	a	body.	When
the	parents	had	flown	away,	he	went	over	to	the	nest	and	offered	these
dummy	beaks	to	the	chicks.	The	beaks	were	obvious	fakes,	and	he
assumed	the	baby	birds	would	reject	them	altogether.

However,	when	the	tiny	gulls	saw	the	red	spot	on	the	cardboard
beak,	they	pecked	away	just	as	if	it	were	attached	to	their	own	mother.
They	had	a	clear	preference	for	those	red	spots—as	if	they	had	been
genetically	programmed	at	birth.	Soon	Tinbergen	discovered	that	the
bigger	the	red	spot,	the	faster	the	chicks	pecked.	Eventually,	he	created
a	beak	with	three	large	red	dots	on	it.	When	he	placed	it	over	the	nest,
the	baby	birds	went	crazy	with	delight.	They	pecked	at	the	little	red
patches	as	if	it	was	the	greatest	beak	they	had	ever	seen.

Tinbergen	and	his	colleagues	discovered	similar	behavior	in	other

animals.	For	example,	the	greylag	goose	is	a	ground-nesting	bird.
Occasionally,	as	the	mother	moves	around	on	the	nest,	one	of	the	eggs
will	roll	out	and	settle	on	the	grass	nearby.	Whenever	this	happens,	the
goose	will	waddle	over	to	the	egg	and	use	its	beak	and	neck	to	pull	it
back	into	the	nest.

Tinbergen	discovered	that	the	goose	will	pull	any	nearby	round
object,	such	as	a	billiard	ball	or	a	lightbulb,	back	into	the	nest.	The
bigger	the	object,	the	greater	their	response.	One	goose	even	made	a
tremendous	effort	to	roll	a	volleyball	back	and	sit	on	top.	Like	the	baby
gulls	automatically	pecking	at	red	dots,	the	greylag	goose	was	following
an	instinctive	rule:	When	I	see	a	round	object	nearby,	I	must	roll	it
back	into	the	nest.	The	bigger	the	round	object,	the	harder	I	should	try
to	get	it.

It’s	like	the	brain	of	each	animal	is	preloaded	with	certain	rules	for
behavior,	and	when	it	comes	across	an	exaggerated	version	of	that	rule,
it	lights	up	like	a	Christmas	tree.	Scientists	refer	to	these	exaggerated
cues	as	supernormal	stimuli.	A	supernormal	stimulus	is	a	heightened
version	of	reality—like	a	beak	with	three	red	dots	or	an	egg	the	size	of	a
volleyball—and	it	elicits	a	stronger	response	than	usual.

Humans	are	also	prone	to	fall	for	exaggerated	versions	of	reality.
Junk	food,	for	example,	drives	our	reward	systems	into	a	frenzy.	After
spending	hundreds	of	thousands	of	years	hunting	and	foraging	for
food	in	the	wild,	the	human	brain	has	evolved	to	place	a	high	value	on
salt,	sugar,	and	fat.	Such	foods	are	often	calorie-dense	and	they	were
quite	rare	when	our	ancient	ancestors	were	roaming	the	savannah.
When	you	don’t	know	where	your	next	meal	is	coming	from,	eating	as
much	as	possible	is	an	excellent	strategy	for	survival.

Today,	however,	we	live	in	a	calorie-rich	environment.	Food	is
abundant,	but	your	brain	continues	to	crave	it	like	it	is	scarce.	Placing
a	high	value	on	salt,	sugar,	and	fat	is	no	longer	advantageous	to	our
health,	but	the	craving	persists	because	the	brain’s	reward	centers	have
not	changed	for	approximately	fifty	thousand	years.	The	modern	food
industry	relies	on	stretching	our	Paleolithic	instincts	beyond	their
evolutionary	purpose.

A	primary	goal	of	food	science	is	to	create	products	that	are	more

attractive	to	consumers.	Nearly	every	food	in	a	bag,	box,	or	jar	has
been	enhanced	in	some	way,	if	only	with	additional	flavoring.
Companies	spend	millions	of	dollars	to	discover	the	most	satisfying
level	of	crunch	in	a	potato	chip	or	the	perfect	amount	of	fizz	in	a	soda.
Entire	departments	are	dedicated	to	optimizing	how	a	product	feels	in
your	mouth—a	quality	known	as	orosensation.	French	fries,	for
example,	are	a	potent	combination—golden	brown	and	crunchy	on	the
outside,	light	and	smooth	on	the	inside.

Other	processed	foods	enhance	dynamic	contrast,	which	refers	to

items	with	a	combination	of	sensations,	like	crunchy	and	creamy.
Imagine	the	gooeyness	of	melted	cheese	on	top	of	a	crispy	pizza	crust,
or	the	crunch	of	an	Oreo	cookie	combined	with	its	smooth	center.	With
natural,	unprocessed	foods,	you	tend	to	experience	the	same
sensations	over	and	over—how’s	that	seventeenth	bite	of	kale	taste?
After	a	few	minutes,	your	brain	loses	interest	and	you	begin	to	feel	full.
But	foods	that	are	high	in	dynamic	contrast	keep	the	experience	novel
and	interesting,	encouraging	you	to	eat	more.

Ultimately,	such	strategies	enable	food	scientists	to	find	the	“bliss
point”	for	each	product—the	precise	combination	of	salt,	sugar,	and	fat
that	excites	your	brain	and	keeps	you	coming	back	for	more.	The
result,	of	course,	is	that	you	overeat	because	hyperpalatable	foods	are
more	attractive	to	the	human	brain.	As	Stephan	Guyenet,	a
neuroscientist	who	specializes	in	eating	behavior	and	obesity,	says,
“We’ve	gotten	too	good	at	pushing	our	own	buttons.”

The	modern	food	industry,	and	the	overeating	habits	it	has
spawned,	is	just	one	example	of	the	2nd	Law	of	Behavior	Change:
Make	it	attractive.	The	more	attractive	an	opportunity	is,	the	more
likely	it	is	to	become	habit-forming.

Look	around.	Society	is	filled	with	highly	engineered	versions	of
reality	that	are	more	attractive	than	the	world	our	ancestors	evolved	in.
Stores	feature	mannequins	with	exaggerated	hips	and	breasts	to	sell
clothes.	Social	media	delivers	more	“likes”	and	praise	in	a	few	minutes
than	we	could	ever	get	in	the	office	or	at	home.	Online	porn	splices
together	stimulating	scenes	at	a	rate	that	would	be	impossible	to
replicate	in	real	life.	Advertisements	are	created	with	a	combination	of
ideal	lighting,	professional	makeup,	and	Photoshopped	edits—even	the
model	doesn’t	look	like	the	person	in	the	final	image.	These	are	the
supernormal	stimuli	of	our	modern	world.	They	exaggerate	features
that	are	naturally	attractive	to	us,	and	our	instincts	go	wild	as	a	result,
driving	us	into	excessive	shopping	habits,	social	media	habits,	porn
habits,	eating	habits,	and	many	others.

If	history	serves	as	a	guide,	the	opportunities	of	the	future	will	be
more	attractive	than	those	of	today.	The	trend	is	for	rewards	to	become
more	concentrated	and	stimuli	to	become	more	enticing.	Junk	food	is	a
more	concentrated	form	of	calories	than	natural	foods.	Hard	liquor	is	a
more	concentrated	form	of	alcohol	than	beer.	Video	games	are	a	more

concentrated	form	of	play	than	board	games.	Compared	to	nature,
these	pleasure-packed	experiences	are	hard	to	resist.	We	have	the
brains	of	our	ancestors	but	temptations	they	never	had	to	face.

If	you	want	to	increase	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	occur,	then	you
need	to	make	it	attractive.	Throughout	our	discussion	of	the	2nd	Law,
our	goal	is	to	learn	how	to	make	our	habits	irresistible.	While	it	is	not
possible	to	transform	every	habit	into	a	supernormal	stimulus,	we	can
make	any	habit	more	enticing.	To	do	this,	we	must	start	by
understanding	what	a	craving	is	and	how	it	works.

We	begin	by	examining	a	biological	signature	that	all	habits	share—

the	dopamine	spike.

THE	DOPAMINE-DRIVEN	FEEDBACK	LOOP

Scientists	can	track	the	precise	moment	a	craving	occurs	by	measuring
a	neurotransmitter	called	dopamine.*	The	importance	of	dopamine
became	apparent	in	1954	when	the	neuroscientists	James	Olds	and
Peter	Milner	ran	an	experiment	that	revealed	the	neurological
processes	behind	craving	and	desire.	By	implanting	electrodes	in	the
brains	of	rats,	the	researchers	blocked	the	release	of	dopamine.	To	the
surprise	of	the	scientists,	the	rats	lost	all	will	to	live.	They	wouldn’t	eat.
They	wouldn’t	have	sex.	They	didn’t	crave	anything.	Within	a	few	days,
the	animals	died	of	thirst.

In	follow-up	studies,	other	scientists	also	inhibited	the	dopamine-
releasing	parts	of	the	brain,	but	this	time,	they	squirted	little	droplets
of	sugar	into	the	mouths	of	the	dopamine-depleted	rats.	Their	little	rat
faces	lit	up	with	pleasurable	grins	from	the	tasty	substance.	Even
though	dopamine	was	blocked,	they	liked	the	sugar	just	as	much	as
before;	they	just	didn’t	want	it	anymore.	The	ability	to	experience
pleasure	remained,	but	without	dopamine,	desire	died.	And	without
desire,	action	stopped.

When	other	researchers	reversed	this	process	and	flooded	the
reward	system	of	the	brain	with	dopamine,	animals	performed	habits
at	breakneck	speed.	In	one	study,	mice	received	a	powerful	hit	of
dopamine	each	time	they	poked	their	nose	in	a	box.	Within	minutes,
the	mice	developed	a	craving	so	strong	they	began	poking	their	nose
into	the	box	eight	hundred	times	per	hour.	(Humans	are	not	so

different:	the	average	slot	machine	player	will	spin	the	wheel	six
hundred	times	per	hour.)

Habits	are	a	dopamine-driven	feedback	loop.	Every	behavior	that	is

highly	habit-forming—taking	drugs,	eating	junk	food,	playing	video
games,	browsing	social	media—is	associated	with	higher	levels	of
dopamine.	The	same	can	be	said	for	our	most	basic	habitual	behaviors
like	eating	food,	drinking	water,	having	sex,	and	interacting	socially.

For	years,	scientists	assumed	dopamine	was	all	about	pleasure,	but

now	we	know	it	plays	a	central	role	in	many	neurological	processes,
including	motivation,	learning	and	memory,	punishment	and	aversion,
and	voluntary	movement.

When	it	comes	to	habits,	the	key	takeaway	is	this:	dopamine	is
released	not	only	when	you	experience	pleasure,	but	also	when	you
anticipate	it.	Gambling	addicts	have	a	dopamine	spike	right	before
they	place	a	bet,	not	after	they	win.	Cocaine	addicts	get	a	surge	of
dopamine	when	they	see	the	powder,	not	after	they	take	it.	Whenever
you	predict	that	an	opportunity	will	be	rewarding,	your	levels	of
dopamine	spike	in	anticipation.	And	whenever	dopamine	rises,	so	does
your	motivation	to	act.

It	is	the	anticipation	of	a	reward—not	the	fulfillment	of	it—that	gets

us	to	take	action.

Interestingly,	the	reward	system	that	is	activated	in	the	brain	when

you	receive	a	reward	is	the	same	system	that	is	activated	when	you
anticipate	a	reward.	This	is	one	reason	the	anticipation	of	an
experience	can	often	feel	better	than	the	attainment	of	it.	As	a	child,
thinking	about	Christmas	morning	can	be	better	than	opening	the
gifts.	As	an	adult,	daydreaming	about	an	upcoming	vacation	can	be
more	enjoyable	than	actually	being	on	vacation.	Scientists	refer	to	this
as	the	difference	between	“wanting”	and	“liking.”

THE	DOPAMINE	SPIKE

FIGURE	9:	Before	a	habit	is	learned	(A),	dopamine	is	released	when	the
reward	is	experienced	for	the	first	time.	The	next	time	around	(B),	dopamine
rises	before	taking	action,	immediately	after	a	cue	is	recognized.	This	spike
leads	to	a	feeling	of	desire	and	a	craving	to	take	action	whenever	the	cue	is
spotted.	Once	a	habit	is	learned,	dopamine	will	not	rise	when	a	reward	is
experienced	because	you	already	expect	the	reward.	However,	if	you	see	a
cue	and	expect	a	reward,	but	do	not	get	one,	then	dopamine	will	drop	in
disappointment	(C).	The	sensitivity	of	the	dopamine	response	can	clearly	be
seen	when	a	reward	is	provided	late	(D).	First,	the	cue	is	identified	and
dopamine	rises	as	a	craving	builds.	Next,	a	response	is	taken	but	the	reward
does	not	come	as	quickly	as	expected	and	dopamine	begins	to	drop.	Finally,
when	the	reward	comes	a	little	later	than	you	had	hoped,	dopamine	spikes
again.	It	is	as	if	the	brain	is	saying,	“See!	I	knew	I	was	right.	Don’t	forget	to
repeat	this	action	next	time.”

Your	brain	has	far	more	neural	circuitry	allocated	for	wanting
rewards	than	for	liking	them.	The	wanting	centers	in	the	brain	are
large:	the	brain	stem,	the	nucleus	accumbens,	the	ventral	tegmental
area,	the	dorsal	striatum,	the	amygdala,	and	portions	of	the	prefrontal
cortex.	By	comparison,	the	liking	centers	of	the	brain	are	much
smaller.	They	are	often	referred	to	as	“hedonic	hot	spots”	and	are
distributed	like	tiny	islands	throughout	the	brain.	For	instance,
researchers	have	found	that	100	percent	of	the	nucleus	accumbens	is
activated	during	wanting.	Meanwhile,	only	10	percent	of	the	structure
is	activated	during	liking.

The	fact	that	the	brain	allocates	so	much	precious	space	to	the

regions	responsible	for	craving	and	desire	provides	further	evidence	of
the	crucial	role	these	processes	play.	Desire	is	the	engine	that	drives
behavior.	Every	action	is	taken	because	of	the	anticipation	that
precedes	it.	It	is	the	craving	that	leads	to	the	response.

These	insights	reveal	the	importance	of	the	2nd	Law	of	Behavior

Change.	We	need	to	make	our	habits	attractive	because	it	is	the
expectation	of	a	rewarding	experience	that	motivates	us	to	act	in	the
first	place.	This	is	where	a	strategy	known	as	temptation	bundling
comes	into	play.

HOW	TO	USE	TEMPTATION	BUNDLING	TO	MAKE	YOUR	HABITS
MORE	ATTRACTIVE

Ronan	Byrne,	an	electrical	engineering	student	in	Dublin,	Ireland,
enjoyed	watching	Netflix,	but	he	also	knew	that	he	should	exercise
more	often	than	he	did.	Putting	his	engineering	skills	to	use,	Byrne
hacked	his	stationary	bike	and	connected	it	to	his	laptop	and
television.	Then	he	wrote	a	computer	program	that	would	allow	Netflix
to	run	only	if	he	was	cycling	at	a	certain	speed.	If	he	slowed	down	for
too	long,	whatever	show	he	was	watching	would	pause	until	he	started
pedaling	again.	He	was,	in	the	words	of	one	fan,	“eliminating	obesity
one	Netflix	binge	at	a	time.”

He	was	also	employing	temptation	bundling	to	make	his	exercise
habit	more	attractive.	Temptation	bundling	works	by	linking	an	action
you	want	to	do	with	an	action	you	need	to	do.	In	Byrne’s	case,	he
bundled	watching	Netflix	(the	thing	he	wanted	to	do)	with	riding	his
stationary	bike	(the	thing	he	needed	to	do).

Businesses	are	masters	at	temptation	bundling.	For	instance,	when
the	American	Broadcasting	Company,	more	commonly	known	as	ABC,
launched	its	Thursday-night	television	lineup	for	the	2014–2015
season,	they	promoted	temptation	bundling	on	a	massive	scale.

Every	Thursday,	the	company	would	air	three	shows	created	by
screenwriter	Shonda	Rhimes—Grey’s	Anatomy,	Scandal,	and	How	to
Get	Away	with	Murder.	They	branded	it	as	“TGIT	on	ABC”	(TGIT
stands	for	Thank	God	It’s	Thursday).	In	addition	to	promoting	the
shows,	ABC	encouraged	viewers	to	make	popcorn,	drink	red	wine,	and
enjoy	the	evening.

Andrew	Kubitz,	head	of	scheduling	for	ABC,	described	the	idea

behind	the	campaign:	“We	see	Thursday	night	as	a	viewership
opportunity,	with	either	couples	or	women	by	themselves	who	want	to
sit	down	and	escape	and	have	fun	and	drink	their	red	wine	and	have
some	popcorn.”	The	brilliance	of	this	strategy	is	that	ABC	was
associating	the	thing	they	needed	viewers	to	do	(watch	their	shows)
with	activities	their	viewers	already	wanted	to	do	(relax,	drink	wine,
and	eat	popcorn).

Over	time,	people	began	to	connect	watching	ABC	with	feeling
relaxed	and	entertained.	If	you	drink	red	wine	and	eat	popcorn	at	8
p.m.	every	Thursday,	then	eventually	“8	p.m.	on	Thursday”	means
relaxation	and	entertainment.	The	reward	gets	associated	with	the	cue,
and	the	habit	of	turning	on	the	television	becomes	more	attractive.

You’re	more	likely	to	find	a	behavior	attractive	if	you	get	to	do	one

of	your	favorite	things	at	the	same	time.	Perhaps	you	want	to	hear
about	the	latest	celebrity	gossip,	but	you	need	to	get	in	shape.	Using
temptation	bundling,	you	could	only	read	the	tabloids	and	watch
reality	shows	at	the	gym.	Maybe	you	want	to	get	a	pedicure,	but	you
need	to	clean	out	your	email	inbox.	Solution:	only	get	a	pedicure	while
processing	overdue	work	emails.

Temptation	bundling	is	one	way	to	apply	a	psychology	theory
known	as	Premack’s	Principle.	Named	after	the	work	of	professor
David	Premack,	the	principle	states	that	“more	probable	behaviors	will
reinforce	less	probable	behaviors.”	In	other	words,	even	if	you	don’t
really	want	to	process	overdue	work	emails,	you’ll	become	conditioned
to	do	it	if	it	means	you	get	to	do	something	you	really	want	to	do	along
the	way.

You	can	even	combine	temptation	bundling	with	the	habit	stacking
strategy	we	discussed	in	Chapter	5	to	create	a	set	of	rules	to	guide	your
behavior.

The	habit	stacking	+	temptation	bundling	formula	is:

1.	 After	[CURRENT	HABIT],	I	will	[HABIT	I	NEED].

2.	 After	[HABIT	I	NEED],	I	will	[HABIT	I	WANT].

If	you	want	to	read	the	news,	but	you	need	to	express	more

gratitude:

1.	 After	I	get	my	morning	coffee,	I	will	say	one	thing	I’m	grateful

for	that	happened	yesterday	(need).

2.	 After	I	say	one	thing	I’m	grateful	for,	I	will	read	the	news	(want).

If	you	want	to	watch	sports,	but	you	need	to	make	sales	calls:

1.	 After	I	get	back	from	my	lunch	break,	I	will	call	three	potential

clients	(need).

2.	 After	I	call	three	potential	clients,	I	will	check	ESPN	(want).

If	you	want	to	check	Facebook,	but	you	need	to	exercise	more:

1.	 After	I	pull	out	my	phone,	I	will	do	ten	burpees	(need).

2.	 After	I	do	ten	burpees,	I	will	check	Facebook	(want).

The	hope	is	that	eventually	you’ll	look	forward	to	calling	three

clients	or	doing	ten	burpees	because	it	means	you	get	to	read	the	latest
sports	news	or	check	Facebook.	Doing	the	thing	you	need	to	do	means
you	get	to	do	the	thing	you	want	to	do.

We	began	this	chapter	by	discussing	supernormal	stimuli,	which	are

heightened	versions	of	reality	that	increase	our	desire	to	take	action.
Temptation	bundling	is	one	way	to	create	a	heightened	version	of	any
habit	by	connecting	it	with	something	you	already	want.	Engineering	a
truly	irresistible	habit	is	a	hard	task,	but	this	simple	strategy	can	be

employed	to	make	nearly	any	habit	more	attractive	than	it	would	be
otherwise.

Chapter	Summary

The	2nd	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	make	it	attractive.

The	more	attractive	an	opportunity	is,	the	more	likely	it	is	to
become	habit-forming.

Habits	are	a	dopamine-driven	feedback	loop.	When	dopamine
rises,	so	does	our	motivation	to	act.

It	is	the	anticipation	of	a	reward—not	the	fulfillment	of	it—that
gets	us	to	take	action.	The	greater	the	anticipation,	the	greater	the
dopamine	spike.

Temptation	bundling	is	one	way	to	make	your	habits	more
attractive.	The	strategy	is	to	pair	an	action	you	want	to	do	with	an
action	you	need	to	do.

The	Role	of	Family	and	Friends	in	Shaping
Your	Habits

I

N	1965,	a	Hungarian	man	named	Laszlo	Polgar	wrote	a	series	of
strange	letters	to	a	woman	named	Klara.

Laszlo	was	a	firm	believer	in	hard	work.	In	fact,	it	was	all	he
believed	in:	he	completely	rejected	the	idea	of	innate	talent.	He
claimed	that	with	deliberate	practice	and	the	development	of	good
habits,	a	child	could	become	a	genius	in	any	field.	His	mantra	was	“A
genius	is	not	born,	but	is	educated	and	trained.”

Laszlo	believed	in	this	idea	so	strongly	that	he	wanted	to	test	it	with

his	own	children—and	he	was	writing	to	Klara	because	he	“needed	a
wife	willing	to	jump	on	board.”	Klara	was	a	teacher	and,	although	she
may	not	have	been	as	adamant	as	Laszlo,	she	also	believed	that	with
proper	instruction,	anyone	could	advance	their	skills.

Laszlo	decided	chess	would	be	a	suitable	field	for	the	experiment,
and	he	laid	out	a	plan	to	raise	his	children	to	become	chess	prodigies.
The	kids	would	be	home-schooled,	a	rarity	in	Hungary	at	the	time.	The
house	would	be	filled	with	chess	books	and	pictures	of	famous	chess
players.	The	children	would	play	against	each	other	constantly	and
compete	in	the	best	tournaments	they	could	find.	The	family	would
keep	a	meticulous	file	system	of	the	tournament	history	of	every
competitor	the	children	faced.	Their	lives	would	be	dedicated	to	chess.

Laszlo	successfully	courted	Klara,	and	within	a	few	years,	the
Polgars	were	parents	to	three	young	girls:	Susan,	Sofia,	and	Judit.

Susan,	the	oldest,	began	playing	chess	when	she	was	four	years	old.

Within	six	months,	she	was	defeating	adults.

Sofia,	the	middle	child,	did	even	better.	By	fourteen,	she	was	a	world

champion,	and	a	few	years	later,	she	became	a	grandmaster.

Judit,	the	youngest,	was	the	best	of	all.	By	age	five,	she	could	beat
her	father.	At	twelve,	she	was	the	youngest	player	ever	listed	among
the	top	one	hundred	chess	players	in	the	world.	At	fifteen	years	and
four	months	old,	she	became	the	youngest	grandmaster	of	all	time—
younger	than	Bobby	Fischer,	the	previous	record	holder.	For	twenty-
seven	years,	she	was	the	number-one-ranked	female	chess	player	in
the	world.

The	childhood	of	the	Polgar	sisters	was	atypical,	to	say	the	least.

And	yet,	if	you	ask	them	about	it,	they	claim	their	lifestyle	was
attractive,	even	enjoyable.	In	interviews,	the	sisters	talk	about	their
childhood	as	entertaining	rather	than	grueling.	They	loved	playing
chess.	They	couldn’t	get	enough	of	it.	Once,	Laszlo	reportedly	found
Sofia	playing	chess	in	the	bathroom	in	the	middle	of	the	night.
Encouraging	her	to	go	back	to	sleep,	he	said,	“Sofia,	leave	the	pieces
alone!”	To	which	she	replied,	“Daddy,	they	won’t	leave	me	alone!”

The	Polgar	sisters	grew	up	in	a	culture	that	prioritized	chess	above

all	else—praised	them	for	it,	rewarded	them	for	it.	In	their	world,	an
obsession	with	chess	was	normal.	And	as	we	are	about	to	see,	whatever
habits	are	normal	in	your	culture	are	among	the	most	attractive
behaviors	you’ll	find.

THE	SEDUCTIVE	PULL	OF	SOCIAL	NORMS

Humans	are	herd	animals.	We	want	to	fit	in,	to	bond	with	others,	and
to	earn	the	respect	and	approval	of	our	peers.	Such	inclinations	are
essential	to	our	survival.	For	most	of	our	evolutionary	history,	our
ancestors	lived	in	tribes.	Becoming	separated	from	the	tribe—or	worse,
being	cast	out—was	a	death	sentence.	“The	lone	wolf	dies,	but	the	pack
survives.”*

Meanwhile,	those	who	collaborated	and	bonded	with	others	enjoyed

increased	safety,	mating	opportunities,	and	access	to	resources.	As
Charles	Darwin	noted,	“In	the	long	history	of	humankind,	those	who
learned	to	collaborate	and	improvise	most	effectively	have	prevailed.”
As	a	result,	one	of	the	deepest	human	desires	is	to	belong.	And	this
ancient	preference	exerts	a	powerful	influence	on	our	modern
behavior.

We	don’t	choose	our	earliest	habits,	we	imitate	them.	We	follow	the

script	handed	down	by	our	friends	and	family,	our	church	or	school,
our	local	community	and	society	at	large.	Each	of	these	cultures	and
groups	comes	with	its	own	set	of	expectations	and	standards—when
and	whether	to	get	married,	how	many	children	to	have,	which
holidays	to	celebrate,	how	much	money	to	spend	on	your	child’s
birthday	party.	In	many	ways,	these	social	norms	are	the	invisible	rules
that	guide	your	behavior	each	day.	You’re	always	keeping	them	in
mind,	even	if	they	are	at	the	not	top	of	your	mind.	Often,	you	follow	the
habits	of	your	culture	without	thinking,	without	questioning,	and
sometimes	without	remembering.	As	the	French	philosopher	Michel
de	Montaigne	wrote,	“The	customs	and	practices	of	life	in	society
sweep	us	along.”

Most	of	the	time,	going	along	with	the	group	does	not	feel	like	a
burden.	Everyone	wants	to	belong.	If	you	grow	up	in	a	family	that
rewards	you	for	your	chess	skills,	playing	chess	will	seem	like	a	very
attractive	thing	to	do.	If	you	work	in	a	job	where	everyone	wears
expensive	suits,	then	you’ll	be	inclined	to	splurge	on	one	as	well.	If	all
of	your	friends	are	sharing	an	inside	joke	or	using	a	new	phrase,	you’ll
want	to	do	it,	too,	so	they	know	that	you	“get	it.”	Behaviors	are
attractive	when	they	help	us	fit	in.

We	imitate	the	habits	of	three	groups	in	particular:

1.	 The	close.

2.	 The	many.

3.	 The	powerful.

Each	group	offers	an	opportunity	to	leverage	the	2nd	Law	of

Behavior	Change	and	make	our	habits	more	attractive.

1.	Imitating	the	Close

Proximity	has	a	powerful	effect	on	our	behavior.	This	is	true	of	the
physical	environment,	as	we	discussed	in	Chapter	6,	but	it	is	also	true
of	the	social	environment.

We	pick	up	habits	from	the	people	around	us.	We	copy	the	way	our

parents	handle	arguments,	the	way	our	peers	flirt	with	one	another,

the	way	our	coworkers	get	results.	When	your	friends	smoke	pot,	you
give	it	a	try,	too.	When	your	wife	has	a	habit	of	double-checking	that
the	door	is	locked	before	going	to	bed,	you	pick	it	up	as	well.

I	find	that	I	often	imitate	the	behavior	of	those	around	me	without
realizing	it.	In	conversation,	I’ll	automatically	assume	the	body	posture
of	the	other	person.	In	college,	I	began	to	talk	like	my	roommates.
When	traveling	to	other	countries,	I	unconsciously	imitate	the	local
accent	despite	reminding	myself	to	stop.

As	a	general	rule,	the	closer	we	are	to	someone,	the	more	likely	we
are	to	imitate	some	of	their	habits.	One	groundbreaking	study	tracked
twelve	thousand	people	for	thirty-two	years	and	found	that	“a	person’s
chances	of	becoming	obese	increased	by	57	percent	if	he	or	she	had	a
friend	who	became	obese.”	It	works	the	other	way,	too.	Another	study
found	that	if	one	person	in	a	relationship	lost	weight,	the	other	partner
would	also	slim	down	about	one	third	of	the	time.	Our	friends	and
family	provide	a	sort	of	invisible	peer	pressure	that	pulls	us	in	their
direction.

Of	course,	peer	pressure	is	bad	only	if	you’re	surrounded	by	bad
influences.	When	astronaut	Mike	Massimino	was	a	graduate	student	at
MIT,	he	took	a	small	robotics	class.	Of	the	ten	people	in	the	class,	four
became	astronauts.	If	your	goal	was	to	make	it	into	space,	then	that
room	was	about	the	best	culture	you	could	ask	for.	Similarly,	one	study
found	that	the	higher	your	best	friend’s	IQ	at	age	eleven	or	twelve,	the
higher	your	IQ	would	be	at	age	fifteen,	even	after	controlling	for
natural	levels	of	intelligence.	We	soak	up	the	qualities	and	practices	of
those	around	us.

One	of	the	most	effective	things	you	can	do	to	build	better	habits	is
to	join	a	culture	where	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal	behavior.
New	habits	seem	achievable	when	you	see	others	doing	them	every
day.	If	you	are	surrounded	by	fit	people,	you’re	more	likely	to	consider
working	out	to	be	a	common	habit.	If	you’re	surrounded	by	jazz	lovers,
you’re	more	likely	to	believe	it’s	reasonable	to	play	jazz	every	day.	Your
culture	sets	your	expectation	for	what	is	“normal.”	Surround	yourself
with	people	who	have	the	habits	you	want	to	have	yourself.	You’ll	rise
together.

To	make	your	habits	even	more	attractive,	you	can	take	this	strategy

one	step	further.

Join	a	culture	where	(1)	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal
behavior	and	(2)	you	already	have	something	in	common	with	the
group.	Steve	Kamb,	an	entrepreneur	in	New	York	City,	runs	a	company
called	Nerd	Fitness,	which	“helps	nerds,	misfits,	and	mutants	lose
weight,	get	strong,	and	get	healthy.”	His	clients	include	video	game
lovers,	movie	fanatics,	and	average	Joes	who	want	to	get	in	shape.
Many	people	feel	out	of	place	the	first	time	they	go	to	the	gym	or	try	to
change	their	diet,	but	if	you	are	already	similar	to	the	other	members
of	the	group	in	some	way—say,	your	mutual	love	of	Star	Wars—change
becomes	more	appealing	because	it	feels	like	something	people	like
you	already	do.

Nothing	sustains	motivation	better	than	belonging	to	the	tribe.	It
transforms	a	personal	quest	into	a	shared	one.	Previously,	you	were	on
your	own.	Your	identity	was	singular.	You	are	a	reader.	You	are	a
musician.	You	are	an	athlete.	When	you	join	a	book	club	or	a	band	or	a
cycling	group,	your	identity	becomes	linked	to	those	around	you.
Growth	and	change	is	no	longer	an	individual	pursuit.	We	are	readers.
We	are	musicians.	We	are	cyclists.	The	shared	identity	begins	to
reinforce	your	personal	identity.	This	is	why	remaining	part	of	a	group
after	achieving	a	goal	is	crucial	to	maintaining	your	habits.	It’s
friendship	and	community	that	embed	a	new	identity	and	help
behaviors	last	over	the	long	run.

2.	Imitating	the	Many

In	the	1950s,	psychologist	Solomon	Asch	conducted	a	series	of
experiments	that	are	now	taught	to	legions	of	undergrads	each	year.	To
begin	each	experiment,	the	subject	entered	the	room	with	a	group	of
strangers.	Unbeknownst	to	them,	the	other	participants	were	actors
planted	by	the	researcher	and	instructed	to	deliver	scripted	answers	to
certain	questions.

The	group	would	be	shown	one	card	with	a	line	on	it	and	then	a
second	card	with	a	series	of	lines.	Each	person	was	asked	to	select	the
line	on	the	second	card	that	was	similar	in	length	to	the	line	on	the	first
card.	It	was	a	very	simple	task.	Here	is	an	example	of	two	cards	used	in
the	experiment:

CONFORMING	TO	SOCIAL	NORMS

FIGURE	10:	This	is	a	representation	of	two	cards	used	by	Solomon	Asch	in
his	famous	social	conformity	experiments.	The	length	of	the	line	on	the	first
card	(left)	is	obviously	the	same	as	line	C,	but	when	a	group	of	actors
claimed	it	was	a	different	length	the	research	subjects	would	often	change
their	minds	and	go	with	the	crowd	rather	than	believe	their	own	eyes.

The	experiment	always	began	the	same.	First,	there	would	be	some

easy	trials	where	everyone	agreed	on	the	correct	line.	After	a	few
rounds,	the	participants	were	shown	a	test	that	was	just	as	obvious	as
the	previous	ones,	except	the	actors	in	the	room	would	select	an
intentionally	incorrect	answer.	For	example,	they	would	respond	“A”
to	the	comparison	shown	in	Figure	10.	Everyone	would	agree	that	the
lines	were	the	same	even	though	they	were	clearly	different.

The	subject,	who	was	unaware	of	the	ruse,	would	immediately
become	bewildered.	Their	eyes	would	open	wide.	They	would	laugh
nervously	to	themselves.	They	would	double-check	the	reactions	of
other	participants.	Their	agitation	would	grow	as	one	person	after
another	delivered	the	same	incorrect	response.	Soon,	the	subject	began
to	doubt	their	own	eyes.	Eventually,	they	delivered	the	answer	they
knew	in	their	heart	to	be	incorrect.

Asch	ran	this	experiment	many	times	and	in	many	different	ways.
What	he	discovered	was	that	as	the	number	of	actors	increased,	so	did
the	conformity	of	the	subject.	If	it	was	just	the	subject	and	one	actor,
then	there	was	no	effect	on	the	person’s	choice.	They	just	assumed	they
were	in	the	room	with	a	dummy.	When	two	actors	were	in	the	room
with	the	subject,	there	was	still	little	impact.	But	as	the	number	of
people	increased	to	three	actors	and	four	and	all	the	way	to	eight,	the
subject	became	more	likely	to	second-guess	themselves.	By	the	end	of
the	experiment,	nearly	75	percent	of	the	subjects	had	agreed	with	the
group	answer	even	though	it	was	obviously	incorrect.

Whenever	we	are	unsure	how	to	act,	we	look	to	the	group	to	guide

our	behavior.	We	are	constantly	scanning	our	environment	and
wondering,	“What	is	everyone	else	doing?”	We	check	reviews	on
Amazon	or	Yelp	or	TripAdvisor	because	we	want	to	imitate	the	“best”
buying,	eating,	and	travel	habits.	It’s	usually	a	smart	strategy.	There	is
evidence	in	numbers.

But	there	can	be	a	downside.

The	normal	behavior	of	the	tribe	often	overpowers	the	desired
behavior	of	the	individual.	For	example,	one	study	found	that	when	a
chimpanzee	learns	an	effective	way	to	crack	nuts	open	as	a	member	of
one	group	and	then	switches	to	a	new	group	that	uses	a	less	effective
strategy,	it	will	avoid	using	the	superior	nut	cracking	method	just	to
blend	in	with	the	rest	of	the	chimps.

Humans	are	similar.	There	is	tremendous	internal	pressure	to
comply	with	the	norms	of	the	group.	The	reward	of	being	accepted	is
often	greater	than	the	reward	of	winning	an	argument,	looking	smart,
or	finding	truth.	Most	days,	we’d	rather	be	wrong	with	the	crowd	than
be	right	by	ourselves.

The	human	mind	knows	how	to	get	along	with	others.	It	wants	to
get	along	with	others.	This	is	our	natural	mode.	You	can	override	it—
you	can	choose	to	ignore	the	group	or	to	stop	caring	what	other	people
think—but	it	takes	work.	Running	against	the	grain	of	your	culture
requires	extra	effort.

When	changing	your	habits	means	challenging	the	tribe,	change	is

unattractive.	When	changing	your	habits	means	fitting	in	with	the
tribe,	change	is	very	attractive.

3.	Imitating	the	Powerful

Humans	everywhere	pursue	power,	prestige,	and	status.	We	want	pins
and	medallions	on	our	jackets.	We	want	President	or	Partner	in	our
titles.	We	want	to	be	acknowledged,	recognized,	and	praised.	This
tendency	can	seem	vain,	but	overall,	it’s	a	smart	move.	Historically,	a
person	with	greater	power	and	status	has	access	to	more	resources,
worries	less	about	survival,	and	proves	to	be	a	more	attractive	mate.

We	are	drawn	to	behaviors	that	earn	us	respect,	approval,

admiration,	and	status.	We	want	to	be	the	one	in	the	gym	who	can	do
muscle-ups	or	the	musician	who	can	play	the	hardest	chord
progressions	or	the	parent	with	the	most	accomplished	children
because	these	things	separate	us	from	the	crowd.	Once	we	fit	in,	we
start	looking	for	ways	to	stand	out.

This	is	one	reason	we	care	so	much	about	the	habits	of	highly
effective	people.	We	try	to	copy	the	behavior	of	successful	people
because	we	desire	success	ourselves.	Many	of	our	daily	habits	are
imitations	of	people	we	admire.	You	replicate	the	marketing	strategies
of	the	most	successful	firms	in	your	industry.	You	make	a	recipe	from
your	favorite	baker.	You	borrow	the	storytelling	strategies	of	your
favorite	writer.	You	mimic	the	communication	style	of	your	boss.	We
imitate	people	we	envy.

High-status	people	enjoy	the	approval,	respect,	and	praise	of	others.

And	that	means	if	a	behavior	can	get	us	approval,	respect,	and	praise,
we	find	it	attractive.

We	are	also	motivated	to	avoid	behaviors	that	would	lower	our
status.	We	trim	our	hedges	and	mow	our	lawn	because	we	don’t	want
to	be	the	slob	of	the	neighborhood.	When	our	mother	comes	to	visit,
we	clean	up	the	house	because	we	don’t	want	to	be	judged.	We	are
continually	wondering	“What	will	others	think	of	me?”	and	altering
our	behavior	based	on	the	answer.

The	Polgar	sisters—the	chess	prodigies	mentioned	at	the	beginning
of	this	chapter—are	evidence	of	the	powerful	and	lasting	impact	social
influences	can	have	on	our	behavior.	The	sisters	practiced	chess	for
many	hours	each	day	and	continued	this	remarkable	effort	for	decades.
But	these	habits	and	behaviors	maintained	their	attractiveness,	in	part,
because	they	were	valued	by	their	culture.	From	the	praise	of	their

parents	to	the	achievement	of	different	status	markers	like	becoming	a
grandmaster,	they	had	many	reasons	to	continue	their	effort.

Chapter	Summary

The	culture	we	live	in	determines	which	behaviors	are	attractive
to	us.

We	tend	to	adopt	habits	that	are	praised	and	approved	of	by	our
culture	because	we	have	a	strong	desire	to	fit	in	and	belong	to	the
tribe.

We	tend	to	imitate	the	habits	of	three	social	groups:	the	close
(family	and	friends),	the	many	(the	tribe),	and	the	powerful	(those
with	status	and	prestige).

One	of	the	most	effective	things	you	can	do	to	build	better	habits
is	to	join	a	culture	where	(1)	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal
behavior	and	(2)	you	already	have	something	in	common	with	the
group.

The	normal	behavior	of	the	tribe	often	overpowers	the	desired
behavior	of	the	individual.	Most	days,	we’d	rather	be	wrong	with
the	crowd	than	be	right	by	ourselves.

If	a	behavior	can	get	us	approval,	respect,	and	praise,	we	find	it
attractive.

How	to	Find	and	Fix	the	Causes	of	Your
Bad	Habits

I

N	LATE	2012,	I	was	sitting	in	an	old	apartment	just	a	few	blocks	from
Istanbul’s	most	famous	street,	Istiklal	Caddesi.	I	was	in	the	middle	of

a	four-day	trip	to	Turkey	and	my	guide,	Mike,	was	relaxing	in	a	worn-
out	armchair	a	few	feet	away.

Mike	wasn’t	really	a	guide.	He	was	just	a	guy	from	Maine	who	had
been	living	in	Turkey	for	five	years,	but	he	offered	to	show	me	around
while	I	was	visiting	the	country	and	I	took	him	up	on	it.	On	this
particular	night,	I	had	been	invited	to	dinner	with	him	and	a	handful	of
his	Turkish	friends.

There	were	seven	of	us,	and	I	was	the	only	one	who	hadn’t,	at	some
point,	smoked	at	least	one	pack	of	cigarettes	per	day.	I	asked	one	of	the
Turks	how	he	got	started.	“Friends,”	he	said.	“It	always	starts	with	your
friends.	One	friend	smokes,	then	you	try	it.”

What	was	truly	fascinating	was	that	half	of	the	people	in	the	room

had	managed	to	quit	smoking.	Mike	had	been	smoke-free	for	a	few
years	at	that	point,	and	he	swore	up	and	down	that	he	broke	the	habit
because	of	a	book	called	Allen	Carr’s	Easy	Way	to	Stop	Smoking.

“It	frees	you	from	the	mental	burden	of	smoking,”	he	said.	“It	tells

you:	‘Stop	lying	to	yourself.	You	know	you	don’t	actually	want	to
smoke.	You	know	you	don’t	really	enjoy	this.’	It	helps	you	feel	like
you’re	not	the	victim	anymore.	You	start	to	realize	that	you	don’t	need
to	smoke.”

I	had	never	tried	a	cigarette,	but	I	took	a	look	at	the	book	afterward

out	of	curiosity.	The	author	employs	an	interesting	strategy	to	help

smokers	eliminate	their	cravings.	He	systematically	reframes	each	cue
associated	with	smoking	and	gives	it	a	new	meaning.

He	says	things	like:

You	think	you	are	quitting	something,	but	you’re	not	quitting
anything	because	cigarettes	do	nothing	for	you.

You	think	smoking	is	something	you	need	to	do	to	be	social,	but
it’s	not.	You	can	be	social	without	smoking	at	all.

You	think	smoking	is	about	relieving	stress,	but	it’s	not.	Smoking
does	not	relieve	your	nerves,	it	destroys	them.

Over	and	over,	he	repeats	these	phrases	and	others	like	them.	“Get
it	clearly	into	your	mind,”	he	says.	“You	are	losing	nothing	and	you	are
making	marvelous	positive	gains	not	only	in	health,	energy	and	money
but	also	in	confidence,	self-respect,	freedom	and,	most	important	of
all,	in	the	length	and	quality	of	your	future	life.”

By	the	time	you	get	to	the	end	of	the	book,	smoking	seems	like	the
most	ridiculous	thing	in	the	world	to	do.	And	if	you	no	longer	expect
smoking	to	bring	you	any	benefits,	you	have	no	reason	to	smoke.	It	is
an	inversion	of	the	2nd	Law	of	Behavior	Change:	make	it	unattractive.

Now,	I	know	this	idea	might	sound	overly	simplistic.	Just	change	your
mind	and	you	can	quit	smoking.	But	stick	with	me	for	a	minute.

WHERE	CRAVINGS	COME	FROM

Every	behavior	has	a	surface	level	craving	and	a	deeper,	underlying
motive.	I	often	have	a	craving	that	goes	something	like	this:	“I	want	to
eat	tacos.”	If	you	were	to	ask	me	why	I	want	to	eat	tacos,	I	wouldn’t
say,	“Because	I	need	food	to	survive.”	But	the	truth	is,	somewhere	deep
down,	I	am	motivated	to	eat	tacos	because	I	have	to	eat	to	survive.	The
underlying	motive	is	to	obtain	food	and	water	even	if	my	specific
craving	is	for	a	taco.

Some	of	our	underlying	motives	include:*

Conserve	energy

Obtain	food	and	water

Find	love	and	reproduce

Connect	and	bond	with	others

Win	social	acceptance	and	approval

Reduce	uncertainty

Achieve	status	and	prestige

A	craving	is	just	a	specific	manifestation	of	a	deeper	underlying
motive.	Your	brain	did	not	evolve	with	a	desire	to	smoke	cigarettes	or
to	check	Instagram	or	to	play	video	games.	At	a	deep	level,	you	simply
want	to	reduce	uncertainty	and	relieve	anxiety,	to	win	social
acceptance	and	approval,	or	to	achieve	status.

Look	at	nearly	any	product	that	is	habit-forming	and	you’ll	see	that

it	does	not	create	a	new	motivation,	but	rather	latches	onto	the
underlying	motives	of	human	nature.

Find	love	and	reproduce	=	using	Tinder

Connect	and	bond	with	others	=	browsing	Facebook

Win	social	acceptance	and	approval	=	posting	on	Instagram

Reduce	uncertainty	=	searching	on	Google

Achieve	status	and	prestige	=	playing	video	games

Your	habits	are	modern-day	solutions	to	ancient	desires.	New
versions	of	old	vices.	The	underlying	motives	behind	human	behavior
remain	the	same.	The	specific	habits	we	perform	differ	based	on	the
period	of	history.

Here’s	the	powerful	part:	there	are	many	different	ways	to	address
the	same	underlying	motive.	One	person	might	learn	to	reduce	stress
by	smoking	a	cigarette.	Another	person	learns	to	ease	their	anxiety	by
going	for	a	run.	Your	current	habits	are	not	necessarily	the	best	way	to
solve	the	problems	you	face;	they	are	just	the	methods	you	learned	to
use.	Once	you	associate	a	solution	with	the	problem	you	need	to	solve,
you	keep	coming	back	to	it.

Habits	are	all	about	associations.	These	associations	determine
whether	we	predict	a	habit	to	be	worth	repeating	or	not.	As	we	covered
in	our	discussion	of	the	1st	Law,	your	brain	is	continually	absorbing

information	and	noticing	cues	in	the	environment.	Every	time	you
perceive	a	cue,	your	brain	runs	a	simulation	and	makes	a	prediction
about	what	to	do	in	the	next	moment.

Cue:	You	notice	that	the	stove	is	hot.

Prediction:	If	I	touch	it	I’ll	get	burned,	so	I	should	avoid	touching	it.

Cue:	You	see	that	the	traffic	light	turned	green.

Prediction:	If	I	step	on	the	gas,	I’ll	make	it	safely	through	the
intersection	and	get	closer	to	my	destination,	so	I	should	step	on	the
gas.

You	see	a	cue,	categorize	it	based	on	past	experience,	and	determine
the	appropriate	response.

This	all	happens	in	an	instant,	but	it	plays	a	crucial	role	in	your
habits	because	every	action	is	preceded	by	a	prediction.	Life	feels
reactive,	but	it	is	actually	predictive.	All	day	long,	you	are	making	your
best	guess	of	how	to	act	given	what	you’ve	just	seen	and	what	has
worked	for	you	in	the	past.	You	are	endlessly	predicting	what	will
happen	in	the	next	moment.

Our	behavior	is	heavily	dependent	on	these	predictions.	Put	another
way,	our	behavior	is	heavily	dependent	on	how	we	interpret	the	events
that	happen	to	us,	not	necessarily	the	objective	reality	of	the	events
themselves.	Two	people	can	look	at	the	same	cigarette,	and	one	feels
the	urge	to	smoke	while	the	other	is	repulsed	by	the	smell.	The	same
cue	can	spark	a	good	habit	or	a	bad	habit	depending	on	your
prediction.	The	cause	of	your	habits	is	actually	the	prediction	that
precedes	them.

These	predictions	lead	to	feelings,	which	is	how	we	typically

describe	a	craving—a	feeling,	a	desire,	an	urge.	Feelings	and	emotions
transform	the	cues	we	perceive	and	the	predictions	we	make	into	a
signal	that	we	can	apply.	They	help	explain	what	we	are	currently
sensing.	For	instance,	whether	or	not	you	realize	it,	you	are	noticing
how	warm	or	cold	you	feel	right	now.	If	the	temperature	drops	by	one
degree,	you	probably	won’t	do	anything.	If	the	temperature	drops	ten
degrees,	however,	you’ll	feel	cold	and	put	on	another	layer	of	clothing.
Feeling	cold	was	the	signal	that	prompted	you	to	act.	You	have	been
sensing	the	cues	the	entire	time,	but	it	is	only	when	you	predict	that
you	would	be	better	off	in	a	different	state	that	you	take	action.

A	craving	is	the	sense	that	something	is	missing.	It	is	the	desire	to
change	your	internal	state.	When	the	temperature	falls,	there	is	a	gap
between	what	your	body	is	currently	sensing	and	what	it	wants	to	be
sensing.	This	gap	between	your	current	state	and	your	desired	state
provides	a	reason	to	act.

Desire	is	the	difference	between	where	you	are	now	and	where	you

want	to	be	in	the	future.	Even	the	tiniest	action	is	tinged	with	the
motivation	to	feel	differently	than	you	do	in	the	moment.	When	you
binge-eat	or	light	up	or	browse	social	media,	what	you	really	want	is
not	a	potato	chip	or	a	cigarette	or	a	bunch	of	likes.	What	you	really
want	is	to	feel	different.

Our	feelings	and	emotions	tell	us	whether	to	hold	steady	in	our
current	state	or	to	make	a	change.	They	help	us	decide	the	best	course
of	action.	Neurologists	have	discovered	that	when	emotions	and
feelings	are	impaired,	we	actually	lose	the	ability	to	make	decisions.
We	have	no	signal	of	what	to	pursue	and	what	to	avoid.	As	the
neuroscientist	Antonio	Damasio	explains,	“It	is	emotion	that	allows
you	to	mark	things	as	good,	bad,	or	indifferent.”

To	summarize,	the	specific	cravings	you	feel	and	habits	you	perform
are	really	an	attempt	to	address	your	fundamental	underlying	motives.
Whenever	a	habit	successfully	addresses	a	motive,	you	develop	a
craving	to	do	it	again.	In	time,	you	learn	to	predict	that	checking	social
media	will	help	you	feel	loved	or	that	watching	YouTube	will	allow	you
to	forget	your	fears.	Habits	are	attractive	when	we	associate	them	with
positive	feelings,	and	we	can	use	this	insight	to	our	advantage	rather
than	to	our	detriment.

HOW	TO	REPROGRAM	YOUR	BRAIN	TO	ENJOY	HARD	HABITS

You	can	make	hard	habits	more	attractive	if	you	can	learn	to	associate
them	with	a	positive	experience.	Sometimes,	all	you	need	is	a	slight
mind-set	shift.	For	instance,	we	often	talk	about	everything	we	have	to
do	in	a	given	day.	You	have	to	wake	up	early	for	work.	You	have	to
make	another	sales	call	for	your	business.	You	have	to	cook	dinner	for
your	family.

Now,	imagine	changing	just	one	word:	You	don’t	“have”	to.	You

“get”	to.

You	get	to	wake	up	early	for	work.	You	get	to	make	another	sales

call	for	your	business.	You	get	to	cook	dinner	for	your	family.	By
simply	changing	one	word,	you	shift	the	way	you	view	each	event.	You
transition	from	seeing	these	behaviors	as	burdens	and	turn	them	into
opportunities.

The	key	point	is	that	both	versions	of	reality	are	true.	You	have	to
do	those	things,	and	you	also	get	to	do	them.	We	can	find	evidence	for
whatever	mind-set	we	choose.

I	once	heard	a	story	about	a	man	who	uses	a	wheelchair.	When

asked	if	it	was	difficult	being	confined,	he	responded,	“I’m	not	confined
to	my	wheelchair—I	am	liberated	by	it.	If	it	wasn’t	for	my	wheelchair,	I
would	be	bed-bound	and	never	able	to	leave	my	house.”	This	shift	in
perspective	completely	transformed	how	he	lived	each	day.

Reframing	your	habits	to	highlight	their	benefits	rather	than	their
drawbacks	is	a	fast	and	lightweight	way	to	reprogram	your	mind	and
make	a	habit	seem	more	attractive.

Exercise.	Many	people	associate	exercise	with	being	a	challenging

task	that	drains	energy	and	wears	you	down.	You	can	just	as	easily
view	it	as	a	way	to	develop	skills	and	build	you	up.	Instead	of	telling
yourself	“I	need	to	go	run	in	the	morning,”	say	“It’s	time	to	build
endurance	and	get	fast.”

Finance.	Saving	money	is	often	associated	with	sacrifice.	However,

you	can	associate	it	with	freedom	rather	than	limitation	if	you	realize
one	simple	truth:	living	below	your	current	means	increases	your
future	means.	The	money	you	save	this	month	increases	your
purchasing	power	next	month.

Meditation.	Anyone	who	has	tried	meditation	for	more	than	three

seconds	knows	how	frustrating	it	can	be	when	the	next	distraction
inevitably	pops	into	your	mind.	You	can	transform	frustration	into
delight	when	you	realize	that	each	interruption	gives	you	a	chance	to
practice	returning	to	your	breath.	Distraction	is	a	good	thing	because
you	need	distractions	to	practice	meditation.

Pregame	jitters.	Many	people	feel	anxious	before	delivering	a	big

presentation	or	competing	in	an	important	event.	They	experience
quicker	breathing,	a	faster	heart	rate,	heightened	arousal.	If	we
interpret	these	feelings	negatively,	then	we	feel	threatened	and	tense
up.	If	we	interpret	these	feelings	positively,	then	we	can	respond	with

fluidity	and	grace.	You	can	reframe	“I	am	nervous”	to	“I	am	excited
and	I’m	getting	an	adrenaline	rush	to	help	me	concentrate.”

These	little	mind-set	shifts	aren’t	magic,	but	they	can	help	change

the	feelings	you	associate	with	a	particular	habit	or	situation.

If	you	want	to	take	it	a	step	further,	you	can	create	a	motivation
ritual.	You	simply	practice	associating	your	habits	with	something	you
enjoy,	then	you	can	use	that	cue	whenever	you	need	a	bit	of
motivation.	For	instance,	if	you	always	play	the	same	song	before
having	sex,	then	you’ll	begin	to	link	the	music	with	the	act.	Whenever
you	want	to	get	in	the	mood,	just	press	play.

Ed	Latimore,	a	boxer	and	writer	from	Pittsburgh,	benefited	from	a
similar	strategy	without	knowing	it.	“Odd	realization,”	he	wrote.	“My
focus	and	concentration	goes	up	just	by	putting	my	headphones	[on]
while	writing.	I	don’t	even	have	to	play	any	music.”	Without	realizing
it,	he	was	conditioning	himself.	In	the	beginning,	he	put	his
headphones	on,	played	some	music	he	enjoyed,	and	did	focused	work.
After	doing	it	five,	ten,	twenty	times,	putting	his	headphones	on
became	a	cue	that	he	automatically	associated	with	increased	focus.
The	craving	followed	naturally.

Athletes	use	similar	strategies	to	get	themselves	in	the	mind-set	to

perform.	During	my	baseball	career,	I	developed	a	specific	ritual	of
stretching	and	throwing	before	each	game.	The	whole	sequence	took
about	ten	minutes,	and	I	did	it	the	same	way	every	single	time.	While	it
physically	warmed	me	up	to	play,	more	importantly,	it	put	me	in	the
right	mental	state.	I	began	to	associate	my	pregame	ritual	with	feeling
competitive	and	focused.	Even	if	I	wasn’t	motivated	beforehand,	by	the
time	I	was	done	with	my	ritual,	I	was	in	“game	mode.”

You	can	adapt	this	strategy	for	nearly	any	purpose.	Say	you	want	to
feel	happier	in	general.	Find	something	that	makes	you	truly	happy—
like	petting	your	dog	or	taking	a	bubble	bath—and	then	create	a	short
routine	that	you	perform	every	time	before	you	do	the	thing	you	love.
Maybe	you	take	three	deep	breaths	and	smile.

Three	deep	breaths.	Smile.	Pet	the	dog.	Repeat.

Eventually,	you’ll	begin	to	associate	this	breathe-and-smile	routine
with	being	in	a	good	mood.	It	becomes	a	cue	that	means	feeling	happy.
Once	established,	you	can	break	it	out	anytime	you	need	to	change
your	emotional	state.	Stressed	at	work?	Take	three	deep	breaths	and

smile.	Sad	about	life?	Three	deep	breaths	and	smile.	Once	a	habit	has
been	built,	the	cue	can	prompt	a	craving,	even	if	it	has	little	to	do	with
the	original	situation.

The	key	to	finding	and	fixing	the	causes	of	your	bad	habits	is	to
reframe	the	associations	you	have	about	them.	It’s	not	easy,	but	if	you
can	reprogram	your	predictions,	you	can	transform	a	hard	habit	into
an	attractive	one.

Walk	Slowly,	but	Never	Backward

O

N	THE	FIRST	day	of	class,	Jerry	Uelsmann,	a	professor	at	the
University	of	Florida,	divided	his	film	photography	students	into

two	groups.

Everyone	on	the	left	side	of	the	classroom,	he	explained,	would	be	in

the	“quantity”	group.	They	would	be	graded	solely	on	the	amount	of
work	they	produced.	On	the	final	day	of	class,	he	would	tally	the
number	of	photos	submitted	by	each	student.	One	hundred	photos
would	rate	an	A,	ninety	photos	a	B,	eighty	photos	a	C,	and	so	on.

Meanwhile,	everyone	on	the	right	side	of	the	room	would	be	in	the
“quality”	group.	They	would	be	graded	only	on	the	excellence	of	their
work.	They	would	only	need	to	produce	one	photo	during	the	semester,
but	to	get	an	A,	it	had	to	be	a	nearly	perfect	image.

At	the	end	of	the	term,	he	was	surprised	to	find	that	all	the	best
photos	were	produced	by	the	quantity	group.	During	the	semester,
these	students	were	busy	taking	photos,	experimenting	with
composition	and	lighting,	testing	out	various	methods	in	the
darkroom,	and	learning	from	their	mistakes.	In	the	process	of	creating
hundreds	of	photos,	they	honed	their	skills.	Meanwhile,	the	quality
group	sat	around	speculating	about	perfection.	In	the	end,	they	had
little	to	show	for	their	efforts	other	than	unverified	theories	and	one
mediocre	photo.*

It	is	easy	to	get	bogged	down	trying	to	find	the	optimal	plan	for

change:	the	fastest	way	to	lose	weight,	the	best	program	to	build
muscle,	the	perfect	idea	for	a	side	hustle.	We	are	so	focused	on	figuring
out	the	best	approach	that	we	never	get	around	to	taking	action.	As
Voltaire	once	wrote,	“The	best	is	the	enemy	of	the	good.”

I	refer	to	this	as	the	difference	between	being	in	motion	and	taking

action.	The	two	ideas	sound	similar,	but	they’re	not	the	same.	When
you’re	in	motion,	you’re	planning	and	strategizing	and	learning.	Those
are	all	good	things,	but	they	don’t	produce	a	result.

Action,	on	the	other	hand,	is	the	type	of	behavior	that	will	deliver	an

outcome.	If	I	outline	twenty	ideas	for	articles	I	want	to	write,	that’s
motion.	If	I	actually	sit	down	and	write	an	article,	that’s	action.	If	I
search	for	a	better	diet	plan	and	read	a	few	books	on	the	topic,	that’s
motion.	If	I	actually	eat	a	healthy	meal,	that’s	action.

Sometimes	motion	is	useful,	but	it	will	never	produce	an	outcome
by	itself.	It	doesn’t	matter	how	many	times	you	go	talk	to	the	personal
trainer,	that	motion	will	never	get	you	in	shape.	Only	the	action	of
working	out	will	get	the	result	you’re	looking	to	achieve.

If	motion	doesn’t	lead	to	results,	why	do	we	do	it?	Sometimes	we	do
it	because	we	actually	need	to	plan	or	learn	more.	But	more	often	than
not,	we	do	it	because	motion	allows	us	to	feel	like	we’re	making
progress	without	running	the	risk	of	failure.	Most	of	us	are	experts	at
avoiding	criticism.	It	doesn’t	feel	good	to	fail	or	to	be	judged	publicly,
so	we	tend	to	avoid	situations	where	that	might	happen.	And	that’s	the
biggest	reason	why	you	slip	into	motion	rather	than	taking	action:	you
want	to	delay	failure.

It’s	easy	to	be	in	motion	and	convince	yourself	that	you’re	still
making	progress.	You	think,	“I’ve	got	conversations	going	with	four
potential	clients	right	now.	This	is	good.	We’re	moving	in	the	right
direction.”	Or,	“I	brainstormed	some	ideas	for	that	book	I	want	to
write.	This	is	coming	together.”

Motion	makes	you	feel	like	you’re	getting	things	done.	But	really,

you’re	just	preparing	to	get	something	done.	When	preparation
becomes	a	form	of	procrastination,	you	need	to	change	something.	You
don’t	want	to	merely	be	planning.	You	want	to	be	practicing.

If	you	want	to	master	a	habit,	the	key	is	to	start	with	repetition,	not
perfection.	You	don’t	need	to	map	out	every	feature	of	a	new	habit.	You
just	need	to	practice	it.	This	is	the	first	takeaway	of	the	3rd	Law:	you
just	need	to	get	your	reps	in.

HOW	LONG	DOES	IT	ACTUALLY	TAKE	TO	FORM	A	NEW	HABIT?

Habit	formation	is	the	process	by	which	a	behavior	becomes
progressively	more	automatic	through	repetition.	The	more	you	repeat
an	activity,	the	more	the	structure	of	your	brain	changes	to	become
efficient	at	that	activity.	Neuroscientists	call	this	long-term
potentiation,	which	refers	to	the	strengthening	of	connections	between
neurons	in	the	brain	based	on	recent	patterns	of	activity.	With	each
repetition,	cell-to-cell	signaling	improves	and	the	neural	connections
tighten.	First	described	by	neuropsychologist	Donald	Hebb	in	1949,
this	phenomenon	is	commonly	known	as	Hebb’s	Law:	“Neurons	that
fire	together	wire	together.”

Repeating	a	habit	leads	to	clear	physical	changes	in	the	brain.	In

musicians,	the	cerebellum—critical	for	physical	movements	like
plucking	a	guitar	string	or	pulling	a	violin	bow—is	larger	than	it	is	in
nonmusicians.	Mathematicians,	meanwhile,	have	increased	gray
matter	in	the	inferior	parietal	lobule,	which	plays	a	key	role	in
computation	and	calculation.	Its	size	is	directly	correlated	with	the
amount	of	time	spent	in	the	field;	the	older	and	more	experienced	the
mathematician,	the	greater	the	increase	in	gray	matter.

When	scientists	analyzed	the	brains	of	taxi	drivers	in	London,	they
found	that	the	hippocampus—a	region	of	the	brain	involved	in	spatial
memory—was	significantly	larger	in	their	subjects	than	in	non–taxi
drivers.	Even	more	fascinating,	the	hippocampus	decreased	in	size
when	a	driver	retired.	Like	the	muscles	of	the	body	responding	to
regular	weight	training,	particular	regions	of	the	brain	adapt	as	they
are	used	and	atrophy	as	they	are	abandoned.

Of	course,	the	importance	of	repetition	in	establishing	habits	was
recognized	long	before	neuroscientists	began	poking	around.	In	1860,
the	English	philosopher	George	H.	Lewes	noted,	“In	learning	to	speak
a	new	language,	to	play	on	a	musical	instrument,	or	to	perform
unaccustomed	movements,	great	difficulty	is	felt,	because	the	channels
through	which	each	sensation	has	to	pass	have	not	become
established;	but	no	sooner	has	frequent	repetition	cut	a	pathway,	than
this	difficulty	vanishes;	the	actions	become	so	automatic	that	they	can
be	performed	while	the	mind	is	otherwise	engaged.”	Both	common
sense	and	scientific	evidence	agree:	repetition	is	a	form	of	change.

Each	time	you	repeat	an	action,	you	are	activating	a	particular
neural	circuit	associated	with	that	habit.	This	means	that	simply
putting	in	your	reps	is	one	of	the	most	critical	steps	you	can	take	to

encoding	a	new	habit.	It	is	why	the	students	who	took	tons	of	photos
improved	their	skills	while	those	who	merely	theorized	about	perfect
photos	did	not.	One	group	engaged	in	active	practice,	the	other	in
passive	learning.	One	in	action,	the	other	in	motion.

All	habits	follow	a	similar	trajectory	from	effortful	practice	to

automatic	behavior,	a	process	known	as	automaticity.	Automaticity	is
the	ability	to	perform	a	behavior	without	thinking	about	each	step,
which	occurs	when	the	nonconscious	mind	takes	over.

It	looks	something	like	this:

THE	HABIT	LINE

FIGURE	11:	In	the	beginning	(point	A),	a	habit	requires	a	good	deal	of	effort
and	concentration	to	perform.	After	a	few	repetitions	(point	B),	it	gets	easier,
but	still	requires	some	conscious	attention.	With	enough	practice	(point	C),
the	habit	becomes	more	automatic	than	conscious.	Beyond	this	threshold
—the	habit	line—the	behavior	can	be	done	more	or	less	without	thinking.	A
new	habit	has	been	formed.

On	the	following	page,	you’ll	see	what	it	looks	like	when	researchers

track	the	level	of	automaticity	for	an	actual	habit	like	walking	for	ten
minutes	each	day.	The	shape	of	these	charts,	which	scientists	call

learning	curves,	reveals	an	important	truth	about	behavior	change:
habits	form	based	on	frequency,	not	time.

WALKING	10	MINUTES	PER	DAY

FIGURE	12:	This	graph	shows	someone	who	built	the	habit	of	walking	for
ten	minutes	after	breakfast	each	day.	Notice	that	as	the	repetitions	increase,
so	does	automaticity,	until	the	behavior	is	as	easy	and	automatic	as	it	can
be.

One	of	the	most	common	questions	I	hear	is,	“How	long	does	it	take
to	build	a	new	habit?”	But	what	people	really	should	be	asking	is,	“How
many	does	it	take	to	form	a	new	habit?”	That	is,	how	many	repetitions
are	required	to	make	a	habit	automatic?

There	is	nothing	magical	about	time	passing	with	regard	to	habit
formation.	It	doesn’t	matter	if	it’s	been	twenty-one	days	or	thirty	days
or	three	hundred	days.	What	matters	is	the	rate	at	which	you	perform
the	behavior.	You	could	do	something	twice	in	thirty	days,	or	two
hundred	times.	It’s	the	frequency	that	makes	the	difference.	Your
current	habits	have	been	internalized	over	the	course	of	hundreds,	if
not	thousands,	of	repetitions.	New	habits	require	the	same	level	of
frequency.	You	need	to	string	together	enough	successful	attempts
until	the	behavior	is	firmly	embedded	in	your	mind	and	you	cross	the
Habit	Line.

In	practice,	it	doesn’t	really	matter	how	long	it	takes	for	a	habit	to
become	automatic.	What	matters	is	that	you	take	the	actions	you	need
to	take	to	make	progress.	Whether	an	action	is	fully	automatic	is	of	less
importance.

To	build	a	habit,	you	need	to	practice	it.	And	the	most	effective	way

to	make	practice	happen	is	to	adhere	to	the	3rd	Law	of	Behavior
Change:	make	it	easy.	The	chapters	that	follow	will	show	you	how	to
do	exactly	that.

Chapter	Summary

The	3rd	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	make	it	easy.

The	most	effective	form	of	learning	is	practice,	not	planning.

Focus	on	taking	action,	not	being	in	motion.

Habit	formation	is	the	process	by	which	a	behavior	becomes
progressively	more	automatic	through	repetition.

The	amount	of	time	you	have	been	performing	a	habit	is	not	as
important	as	the	number	of	times	you	have	performed	it.

The	Law	of	Least	Effort

I

N	HIS	AWARD-WINNING	BOOK,	Guns,	Germs,	and	Steel,	anthropologist
and	biologist	Jared	Diamond	points	out	a	simple	fact:	different

continents	have	different	shapes.	At	first	glance,	this	statement	seems
rather	obvious	and	unimportant,	but	it	turns	out	to	have	a	profound
impact	on	human	behavior.

The	primary	axis	of	the	Americas	runs	from	north	to	south.	That	is,

the	landmass	of	North	and	South	America	tends	to	be	tall	and	thin
rather	than	wide	and	fat.	The	same	is	generally	true	for	Africa.
Meanwhile,	the	landmass	that	makes	up	Europe,	Asia,	and	the	Middle
East	is	the	opposite.	This	massive	stretch	of	land	tends	to	be	more	east-
west	in	shape.	According	to	Diamond,	this	difference	in	shape	played	a
significant	role	in	the	spread	of	agriculture	over	the	centuries.

When	agriculture	began	to	spread	around	the	globe,	farmers	had	an

easier	time	expanding	along	east-west	routes	than	along	north-south
ones.	This	is	because	locations	along	the	same	latitude	generally	share
similar	climates,	amounts	of	sunlight	and	rainfall,	and	changes	in
season.	These	factors	allowed	farmers	in	Europe	and	Asia	to
domesticate	a	few	crops	and	grow	them	along	the	entire	stretch	of	land
from	France	to	China.

THE	SHAPE	OF	HUMAN	BEHAVIOR

FIGURE	13:	The	primary	axis	of	Europe	and	Asia	is	east-west.	The	primary
axis	of	the	Americas	and	Africa	is	north-south.	This	leads	to	a	wider	range	of
climates	up-and-down	the	Americas	than	across	Europe	and	Asia.	As	a
result,	agriculture	spread	nearly	twice	as	fast	across	Europe	and	Asia	than	it
did	elsewhere.	The	behavior	of	farmers—even	across	hundreds	or
thousands	of	years—was	constrained	by	the	amount	of	friction	in	the
environment.

By	comparison,	the	climate	varies	greatly	when	traveling	from	north

to	south.	Just	imagine	how	different	the	weather	is	in	Florida
compared	to	Canada.	You	can	be	the	most	talented	farmer	in	the
world,	but	it	won’t	help	you	grow	Florida	oranges	in	the	Canadian
winter.	Snow	is	a	poor	substitute	for	soil.	In	order	to	spread	crops
along	north-south	routes,	farmers	would	need	to	find	and	domesticate
new	plants	whenever	the	climate	changed.

As	a	result,	agriculture	spread	two	to	three	times	faster	across	Asia

and	Europe	than	it	did	up	and	down	the	Americas.	Over	the	span	of
centuries,	this	small	difference	had	a	very	big	impact.	Increased	food
production	allowed	for	more	rapid	population	growth.	With	more
people,	these	cultures	were	able	to	build	stronger	armies	and	were
better	equipped	to	develop	new	technologies.	The	changes	started	out

small—a	crop	that	spread	slightly	farther,	a	population	that	grew
slightly	faster—but	compounded	into	substantial	differences	over	time.

The	spread	of	agriculture	provides	an	example	of	the	3rd	Law	of
Behavior	Change	on	a	global	scale.	Conventional	wisdom	holds	that
motivation	is	the	key	to	habit	change.	Maybe	if	you	really	wanted	it,
you’d	actually	do	it.	But	the	truth	is,	our	real	motivation	is	to	be	lazy
and	to	do	what	is	convenient.	And	despite	what	the	latest	productivity
best	seller	will	tell	you,	this	is	a	smart	strategy,	not	a	dumb	one.

Energy	is	precious,	and	the	brain	is	wired	to	conserve	it	whenever
possible.	It	is	human	nature	to	follow	the	Law	of	Least	Effort,	which
states	that	when	deciding	between	two	similar	options,	people	will
naturally	gravitate	toward	the	option	that	requires	the	least	amount	of
work.*	For	example,	expanding	your	farm	to	the	east	where	you	can
grow	the	same	crops	rather	than	heading	north	where	the	climate	is
different.	Out	of	all	the	possible	actions	we	could	take,	the	one	that	is
realized	is	the	one	that	delivers	the	most	value	for	the	least	effort.	We
are	motivated	to	do	what	is	easy.

Every	action	requires	a	certain	amount	of	energy.	The	more	energy

required,	the	less	likely	it	is	to	occur.	If	your	goal	is	to	do	a	hundred
push-ups	per	day,	that’s	a	lot	of	energy!	In	the	beginning,	when	you’re
motivated	and	excited,	you	can	muster	the	strength	to	get	started.	But
after	a	few	days,	such	a	massive	effort	feels	exhausting.	Meanwhile,
sticking	to	the	habit	of	doing	one	push-up	per	day	requires	almost	no
energy	to	get	started.	And	the	less	energy	a	habit	requires,	the	more
likely	it	is	to	occur.

Look	at	any	behavior	that	fills	up	much	of	your	life	and	you’ll	see
that	it	can	be	performed	with	very	low	levels	of	motivation.	Habits	like
scrolling	on	our	phones,	checking	email,	and	watching	television	steal
so	much	of	our	time	because	they	can	be	performed	almost	without
effort.	They	are	remarkably	convenient.

In	a	sense,	every	habit	is	just	an	obstacle	to	getting	what	you	really
want.	Dieting	is	an	obstacle	to	getting	fit.	Meditation	is	an	obstacle	to
feeling	calm.	Journaling	is	an	obstacle	to	thinking	clearly.	You	don’t
actually	want	the	habit	itself.	What	you	really	want	is	the	outcome	the
habit	delivers.	The	greater	the	obstacle—that	is,	the	more	difficult	the
habit—the	more	friction	there	is	between	you	and	your	desired	end
state.	This	is	why	it	is	crucial	to	make	your	habits	so	easy	that	you’ll	do

them	even	when	you	don’t	feel	like	it.	If	you	can	make	your	good	habits
more	convenient,	you’ll	be	more	likely	to	follow	through	on	them.

But	what	about	all	the	moments	when	we	seem	to	do	the	opposite?
If	we’re	all	so	lazy,	then	how	do	you	explain	people	accomplishing	hard
things	like	raising	a	child	or	starting	a	business	or	climbing	Mount
Everest?

Certainly,	you	are	capable	of	doing	very	hard	things.	The	problem	is

that	some	days	you	feel	like	doing	the	hard	work	and	some	days	you
feel	like	giving	in.	On	the	tough	days,	it’s	crucial	to	have	as	many	things
working	in	your	favor	as	possible	so	that	you	can	overcome	the
challenges	life	naturally	throws	your	way.	The	less	friction	you	face,	the
easier	it	is	for	your	stronger	self	to	emerge.	The	idea	behind	make	it
easy	is	not	to	only	do	easy	things.	The	idea	is	to	make	it	as	easy	as
possible	in	the	moment	to	do	things	that	payoff	in	the	long	run.

HOW	TO	ACHIEVE	MORE	WITH	LESS	EFFORT

Imagine	you	are	holding	a	garden	hose	that	is	bent	in	the	middle.
Some	water	can	flow	through,	but	not	very	much.	If	you	want	to
increase	the	rate	at	which	water	passes	through	the	hose,	you	have	two
options.	The	first	option	is	to	crank	up	the	valve	and	force	more	water
out.	The	second	option	is	to	simply	remove	the	bend	in	the	hose	and	let
water	flow	through	naturally.

Trying	to	pump	up	your	motivation	to	stick	with	a	hard	habit	is	like
trying	to	force	water	through	a	bent	hose.	You	can	do	it,	but	it	requires
a	lot	of	effort	and	increases	the	tension	in	your	life.	Meanwhile,	making
your	habits	simple	and	easy	is	like	removing	the	bend	in	the	hose.
Rather	than	trying	to	overcome	the	friction	in	your	life,	you	reduce	it.

One	of	the	most	effective	ways	to	reduce	the	friction	associated	with

your	habits	is	to	practice	environment	design.	In	Chapter	6,	we
discussed	environment	design	as	a	method	for	making	cues	more
obvious,	but	you	can	also	optimize	your	environment	to	make	actions
easier.	For	example,	when	deciding	where	to	practice	a	new	habit,	it	is
best	to	choose	a	place	that	is	already	along	the	path	of	your	daily
routine.	Habits	are	easier	to	build	when	they	fit	into	the	flow	of	your
life.	You	are	more	likely	to	go	to	the	gym	if	it	is	on	your	way	to	work
because	stopping	doesn’t	add	much	friction	to	your	lifestyle.	By

comparison,	if	the	gym	is	off	the	path	of	your	normal	commute—even
by	just	a	few	blocks—now	you’re	going	“out	of	your	way”	to	get	there.

Perhaps	even	more	effective	is	reducing	the	friction	within	your

home	or	office.	Too	often,	we	try	to	start	habits	in	high-friction
environments.	We	try	to	follow	a	strict	diet	while	we	are	out	to	dinner
with	friends.	We	try	to	write	a	book	in	a	chaotic	household.	We	try	to
concentrate	while	using	a	smartphone	filled	with	distractions.	It
doesn’t	have	to	be	this	way.	We	can	remove	the	points	of	friction	that
hold	us	back.	This	is	precisely	what	electronics	manufacturers	in	Japan
began	to	do	in	the	1970s.

In	an	article	published	in	the	New	Yorker	titled	“Better	All	the

Time,”	James	Suroweicki	writes:

“Japanese	firms	emphasized	what	came	to	be	known	as	‘lean

production,’	relentlessly	looking	to	remove	waste	of	all	kinds	from	the
production	process,	down	to	redesigning	workspaces,	so	workers
didn’t	have	to	waste	time	twisting	and	turning	to	reach	their	tools.	The
result	was	that	Japanese	factories	were	more	efficient	and	Japanese
products	were	more	reliable	than	American	ones.	In	1974,	service	calls
for	American-made	color	televisions	were	five	times	as	common	as	for
Japanese	televisions.	By	1979,	it	took	American	workers	three	times	as
long	to	assemble	their	sets.”

I	like	to	refer	to	this	strategy	as	addition	by	subtraction.*	The

Japanese	companies	looked	for	every	point	of	friction	in	the
manufacturing	process	and	eliminated	it.	As	they	subtracted	wasted
effort,	they	added	customers	and	revenue.	Similarly,	when	we	remove
the	points	of	friction	that	sap	our	time	and	energy,	we	can	achieve
more	with	less	effort.	(This	is	one	reason	tidying	up	can	feel	so	good:
we	are	simultaneously	moving	forward	and	lightening	the	cognitive
load	our	environment	places	on	us.)

If	you	look	at	the	most	habit-forming	products,	you’ll	notice	that
one	of	the	things	these	goods	and	services	do	best	is	remove	little	bits
of	friction	from	your	life.	Meal	delivery	services	reduce	the	friction	of
shopping	for	groceries.	Dating	apps	reduce	the	friction	of	making
social	introductions.	Ride-sharing	services	reduce	the	friction	of
getting	across	town.	Text	messaging	reduces	the	friction	of	sending	a
letter	in	the	mail.

Like	a	Japanese	television	manufacturer	redesigning	their

workspace	to	reduce	wasted	motion,	successful	companies	design	their
products	to	automate,	eliminate,	or	simplify	as	many	steps	as	possible.
They	reduce	the	number	of	fields	on	each	form.	They	pare	down	the
number	of	clicks	required	to	create	an	account.	They	deliver	their
products	with	easy-to-understand	directions	or	ask	their	customers	to
make	fewer	choices.

When	the	first	voice-activated	speakers	were	released—products

like	Google	Home,	Amazon	Echo,	and	Apple	HomePod—I	asked	a
friend	what	he	liked	about	the	product	he	had	purchased.	He	said	it
was	just	easier	to	say	“Play	some	country	music”	than	to	pull	out	his
phone,	open	the	music	app,	and	pick	a	playlist.	Of	course,	just	a	few
years	earlier,	having	unlimited	access	to	music	in	your	pocket	was	a
remarkably	frictionless	behavior	compared	to	driving	to	the	store	and
buying	a	CD.	Business	is	a	never-ending	quest	to	deliver	the	same
result	in	an	easier	fashion.

Similar	strategies	have	been	used	effectively	by	governments.	When

the	British	government	wanted	to	increase	tax	collection	rates,	they
switched	from	sending	citizens	to	a	web	page	where	the	tax	form	could
be	downloaded	to	linking	directly	to	the	form.	Reducing	that	one	step
in	the	process	increased	the	response	rate	from	19.2	percent	to	23.4
percent.	For	a	country	like	the	United	Kingdom,	those	percentage
points	represent	millions	in	tax	revenue.

The	central	idea	is	to	create	an	environment	where	doing	the	right
thing	is	as	easy	as	possible.	Much	of	the	battle	of	building	better	habits
comes	down	to	finding	ways	to	reduce	the	friction	associated	with	our
good	habits	and	increase	the	friction	associated	with	our	bad	ones.

PRIME	THE	ENVIRONMENT	FOR	FUTURE	USE

Oswald	Nuckols	is	an	IT	developer	from	Natchez,	Mississippi.	He	is
also	someone	who	understands	the	power	of	priming	his	environment.

Nuckols	dialed	in	his	cleaning	habits	by	following	a	strategy	he

refers	to	as	“resetting	the	room.”	For	instance,	when	he	finishes
watching	television,	he	places	the	remote	back	on	the	TV	stand,
arranges	the	pillows	on	the	couch,	and	folds	the	blanket.	When	he
leaves	his	car,	he	throws	any	trash	away.	Whenever	he	takes	a	shower,
he	wipes	down	the	toilet	while	the	shower	is	warming	up.	(As	he	notes,

the	“perfect	time	to	clean	the	toilet	is	right	before	you	wash	yourself	in
the	shower	anyway.”)	The	purpose	of	resetting	each	room	is	not	simply
to	clean	up	after	the	last	action,	but	to	prepare	for	the	next	action.

“When	I	walk	into	a	room	everything	is	in	its	right	place,”	Nuckols
wrote.	“Because	I	do	this	every	day	in	every	room,	stuff	always	stays	in
good	shape.	.	.	.	People	think	I	work	hard	but	I’m	actually	really	lazy.
I’m	just	proactively	lazy.	It	gives	you	so	much	time	back.”

Whenever	you	organize	a	space	for	its	intended	purpose,	you	are
priming	it	to	make	the	next	action	easy.	For	instance,	my	wife	keeps	a
box	of	greeting	cards	that	are	presorted	by	occasion—birthday,
sympathy,	wedding,	graduation,	and	more.	Whenever	necessary,	she
grabs	an	appropriate	card	and	sends	it	off.	She	is	incredibly	good	at
remembering	to	send	cards	because	she	has	reduced	the	friction	of
doing	so.	For	years,	I	was	the	opposite.	Someone	would	have	a	baby
and	I	would	think,	“I	should	send	a	card.”	But	then	weeks	would	pass
and	by	the	time	I	remembered	to	pick	one	up	at	the	store,	it	was	too
late.	The	habit	wasn’t	easy.

There	are	many	ways	to	prime	your	environment	so	it’s	ready	for
immediate	use.	If	you	want	to	cook	a	healthy	breakfast,	place	the	skillet
on	the	stove,	set	the	cooking	spray	on	the	counter,	and	lay	out	any
plates	and	utensils	you’ll	need	the	night	before.	When	you	wake	up,
making	breakfast	will	be	easy.

Want	to	draw	more?	Put	your	pencils,	pens,	notebooks,	and
drawing	tools	on	top	of	your	desk,	within	easy	reach.

Want	to	exercise?	Set	out	your	workout	clothes,	shoes,	gym	bag,
and	water	bottle	ahead	of	time.

Want	to	improve	your	diet?	Chop	up	a	ton	of	fruits	and	vegetables
on	weekends	and	pack	them	in	containers,	so	you	have	easy
access	to	healthy,	ready-to-eat	options	during	the	week.

These	are	simple	ways	to	make	the	good	habit	the	path	of	least

resistance.

You	can	also	invert	this	principle	and	prime	the	environment	to
make	bad	behaviors	difficult.	If	you	find	yourself	watching	too	much
television,	for	example,	then	unplug	it	after	each	use.	Only	plug	it	back

in	if	you	can	say	out	loud	the	name	of	the	show	you	want	to	watch.	This
setup	creates	just	enough	friction	to	prevent	mindless	viewing.

If	that	doesn’t	do	it,	you	can	take	it	a	step	further.	Unplug	the

television	and	take	the	batteries	out	of	the	remote	after	each	use,	so	it
takes	an	extra	ten	seconds	to	turn	it	back	on.	And	if	you’re	really	hard-
core,	move	the	television	out	of	the	living	room	and	into	a	closet	after
each	use.	You	can	be	sure	you’ll	only	take	it	out	when	you	really	want
to	watch	something.	The	greater	the	friction,	the	less	likely	the	habit.

Whenever	possible,	I	leave	my	phone	in	a	different	room	until

lunch.	When	it’s	right	next	to	me,	I’ll	check	it	all	morning	for	no	reason
at	all.	But	when	it	is	in	another	room,	I	rarely	think	about	it.	And	the
friction	is	high	enough	that	I	won’t	go	get	it	without	a	reason.	As	a
result,	I	get	three	to	four	hours	each	morning	when	I	can	work	without
interruption.

If	sticking	your	phone	in	another	room	doesn’t	seem	like	enough,
tell	a	friend	or	family	member	to	hide	it	from	you	for	a	few	hours.	Ask	a
coworker	to	keep	it	at	their	desk	in	the	morning	and	give	it	back	to	you
at	lunch.

It	is	remarkable	how	little	friction	is	required	to	prevent	unwanted
behavior.	When	I	hide	beer	in	the	back	of	the	fridge	where	I	can’t	see	it,
I	drink	less.	When	I	delete	social	media	apps	from	my	phone,	it	can	be
weeks	before	I	download	them	again	and	log	in.	These	tricks	are
unlikely	to	curb	a	true	addiction,	but	for	many	of	us,	a	little	bit	of
friction	can	be	the	difference	between	sticking	with	a	good	habit	or
sliding	into	a	bad	one.	Imagine	the	cumulative	impact	of	making
dozens	of	these	changes	and	living	in	an	environment	designed	to
make	the	good	behaviors	easier	and	the	bad	behaviors	harder.

Whether	we	are	approaching	behavior	change	as	an	individual,	a

parent,	a	coach,	or	a	leader,	we	should	ask	ourselves	the	same
question:	“How	can	we	design	a	world	where	it’s	easy	to	do	what’s
right?”	Redesign	your	life	so	the	actions	that	matter	most	are	also	the
actions	that	are	easiest	to	do.

Human	behavior	follows	the	Law	of	Least	Effort.	We	will	naturally
gravitate	toward	the	option	that	requires	the	least	amount	of
work.

“I	begin	each	day	of	my	life	with	a	ritual,”	she	writes.	“I	wake	up	at
5:30	A.M.,	put	on	my	workout	clothes,	my	leg	warmers,	my	sweat	shirt,
and	my	hat.	I	walk	outside	my	Manhattan	home,	hail	a	taxi,	and	tell
the	driver	to	take	me	to	the	Pumping	Iron	gym	at	91st	Street	and	First
Avenue,	where	I	work	out	for	two	hours.

“The	ritual	is	not	the	stretching	and	weight	training	I	put	my	body
through	each	morning	at	the	gym;	the	ritual	is	the	cab.	The	moment	I
tell	the	driver	where	to	go	I	have	completed	the	ritual.

“It’s	a	simple	act,	but	doing	it	the	same	way	each	morning

habitualizes	it—makes	it	repeatable,	easy	to	do.	It	reduces	the	chance
that	I	would	skip	it	or	do	it	differently.	It	is	one	more	item	in	my
arsenal	of	routines,	and	one	less	thing	to	think	about.”

Hailing	a	cab	each	morning	may	be	a	tiny	action,	but	it	is	a	splendid

example	of	the	3rd	Law	of	Behavior	Change.

Researchers	estimate	that	40	to	50	percent	of	our	actions	on	any

given	day	are	done	out	of	habit.	This	is	already	a	substantial
percentage,	but	the	true	influence	of	your	habits	is	even	greater	than
these	numbers	suggest.	Habits	are	automatic	choices	that	influence	the

conscious	decisions	that	follow.	Yes,	a	habit	can	be	completed	in	just	a
few	seconds,	but	it	can	also	shape	the	actions	that	you	take	for	minutes
or	hours	afterward.

Habits	are	like	the	entrance	ramp	to	a	highway.	They	lead	you	down

a	path	and,	before	you	know	it,	you’re	speeding	toward	the	next
behavior.	It	seems	to	be	easier	to	continue	what	you	are	already	doing
than	to	start	doing	something	different.	You	sit	through	a	bad	movie
for	two	hours.	You	keep	snacking	even	when	you’re	already	full.	You
check	your	phone	for	“just	a	second”	and	soon	you	have	spent	twenty
minutes	staring	at	the	screen.	In	this	way,	the	habits	you	follow
without	thinking	often	determine	the	choices	you	make	when	you	are
thinking.

Each	evening,	there	is	a	tiny	moment—usually	around	5:15	p.m.—
that	shapes	the	rest	of	my	night.	My	wife	walks	in	the	door	from	work
and	either	we	change	into	our	workout	clothes	and	head	to	the	gym	or
we	crash	onto	the	couch,	order	Indian	food,	and	watch	The	Office.*
Similar	to	Twyla	Tharp	hailing	the	cab,	the	ritual	is	changing	into	my
workout	clothes.	If	I	change	clothes,	I	know	the	workout	will	happen.
Everything	that	follows—driving	to	the	gym,	deciding	which	exercises
to	do,	stepping	under	the	bar—is	easy	once	I’ve	taken	the	first	step.

Every	day,	there	are	a	handful	of	moments	that	deliver	an	outsized
impact.	I	refer	to	these	little	choices	as	decisive	moments.	The	moment
you	decide	between	ordering	takeout	or	cooking	dinner.	The	moment
you	choose	between	driving	your	car	or	riding	your	bike.	The	moment
you	decide	between	starting	your	homework	or	grabbing	the	video
game	controller.	These	choices	are	a	fork	in	the	road.

DECISIVE	MOMENTS

FIGURE	14:	The	difference	between	a	good	day	and	a	bad	day	is	often	a
few	productive	and	healthy	choices	made	at	decisive	moments.	Each	one	is
like	a	fork	in	the	road,	and	these	choices	stack	up	throughout	the	day	and
can	ultimately	lead	to	very	different	outcomes.

Decisive	moments	set	the	options	available	to	your	future	self.	For

instance,	walking	into	a	restaurant	is	a	decisive	moment	because	it
determines	what	you’ll	be	eating	for	lunch.	Technically,	you	are	in
control	of	what	you	order,	but	in	a	larger	sense,	you	can	only	order	an
item	if	it	is	on	the	menu.	If	you	walk	into	a	steakhouse,	you	can	get	a
sirloin	or	a	rib	eye,	but	not	sushi.	Your	options	are	constrained	by
what’s	available.	They	are	shaped	by	the	first	choice.

We	are	limited	by	where	our	habits	lead	us.	This	is	why	mastering
the	decisive	moments	throughout	your	day	is	so	important.	Each	day	is
made	up	of	many	moments,	but	it	is	really	a	few	habitual	choices	that
determine	the	path	you	take.	These	little	choices	stack	up,	each	one
setting	the	trajectory	for	how	you	spend	the	next	chunk	of	time.

Habits	are	the	entry	point,	not	the	end	point.	They	are	the	cab,	not

the	gym.

THE	TWO-MINUTE	RULE

Even	when	you	know	you	should	start	small,	it’s	easy	to	start	too	big.
When	you	dream	about	making	a	change,	excitement	inevitably	takes
over	and	you	end	up	trying	to	do	too	much	too	soon.	The	most	effective
way	I	know	to	counteract	this	tendency	is	to	use	the	Two-Minute	Rule,
which	states,	“When	you	start	a	new	habit,	it	should	take	less	than	two
minutes	to	do.”

You’ll	find	that	nearly	any	habit	can	be	scaled	down	into	a	two-

minute	version:

“Read	before	bed	each	night”	becomes	“Read	one	page.”

“Do	thirty	minutes	of	yoga”	becomes	“Take	out	my	yoga	mat.”

“Study	for	class”	becomes	“Open	my	notes.”

“Fold	the	laundry”	becomes	“Fold	one	pair	of	socks.”

“Run	three	miles”	becomes	“Tie	my	running	shoes.”

The	idea	is	to	make	your	habits	as	easy	as	possible	to	start.	Anyone
can	meditate	for	one	minute,	read	one	page,	or	put	one	item	of	clothing
away.	And,	as	we	have	just	discussed,	this	is	a	powerful	strategy
because	once	you’ve	started	doing	the	right	thing,	it	is	much	easier	to
continue	doing	it.	A	new	habit	should	not	feel	like	a	challenge.	The
actions	that	follow	can	be	challenging,	but	the	first	two	minutes	should
be	easy.	What	you	want	is	a	“gateway	habit”	that	naturally	leads	you
down	a	more	productive	path.

You	can	usually	figure	out	the	gateway	habits	that	will	lead	to	your
desired	outcome	by	mapping	out	your	goals	on	a	scale	from	“very	easy”
to	“very	hard.”	For	instance,	running	a	marathon	is	very	hard.	Running
a	5K	is	hard.	Walking	ten	thousand	steps	is	moderately	difficult.
Walking	ten	minutes	is	easy.	And	putting	on	your	running	shoes	is	very
easy.	Your	goal	might	be	to	run	a	marathon,	but	your	gateway	habit	is
to	put	on	your	running	shoes.	That’s	how	you	follow	the	Two-Minute
Rule.

People	often	think	it’s	weird	to	get	hyped	about	reading	one	page	or
meditating	for	one	minute	or	making	one	sales	call.	But	the	point	is	not
to	do	one	thing.	The	point	is	to	master	the	habit	of	showing	up.	The
truth	is,	a	habit	must	be	established	before	it	can	be	improved.	If	you
can’t	learn	the	basic	skill	of	showing	up,	then	you	have	little	hope	of
mastering	the	finer	details.	Instead	of	trying	to	engineer	a	perfect	habit
from	the	start,	do	the	easy	thing	on	a	more	consistent	basis.	You	have
to	standardize	before	you	can	optimize.

As	you	master	the	art	of	showing	up,	the	first	two	minutes	simply
become	a	ritual	at	the	beginning	of	a	larger	routine.	This	is	not	merely
a	hack	to	make	habits	easier	but	actually	the	ideal	way	to	master	a
difficult	skill.	The	more	you	ritualize	the	beginning	of	a	process,	the
more	likely	it	becomes	that	you	can	slip	into	the	state	of	deep	focus
that	is	required	to	do	great	things.	By	doing	the	same	warm-up	before
every	workout,	you	make	it	easier	to	get	into	a	state	of	peak
performance.	By	following	the	same	creative	ritual,	you	make	it	easier
to	get	into	the	hard	work	of	creating.	By	developing	a	consistent
power-down	habit,	you	make	it	easier	to	get	to	bed	at	a	reasonable	time
each	night.	You	may	not	be	able	to	automate	the	whole	process,	but
you	can	make	the	first	action	mindless.	Make	it	easy	to	start	and	the
rest	will	follow.

The	Two-Minute	Rule	can	seem	like	a	trick	to	some	people.	You
know	that	the	real	goal	is	to	do	more	than	just	two	minutes,	so	it	may
feel	like	you’re	trying	to	fool	yourself.	Nobody	is	actually	aspiring	to
read	one	page	or	do	one	push-up	or	open	their	notes.	And	if	you	know
it’s	a	mental	trick,	why	would	you	fall	for	it?

If	the	Two-Minute	Rule	feels	forced,	try	this:	do	it	for	two	minutes
and	then	stop.	Go	for	a	run,	but	you	must	stop	after	two	minutes.	Start
meditating,	but	you	must	stop	after	two	minutes.	Study	Arabic,	but	you

must	stop	after	two	minutes.	It’s	not	a	strategy	for	starting,	it’s	the
whole	thing.	Your	habit	can	only	last	one	hundred	and	twenty	seconds.

One	of	my	readers	used	this	strategy	to	lose	over	one	hundred
pounds.	In	the	beginning,	he	went	to	the	gym	each	day,	but	he	told
himself	he	wasn’t	allowed	to	stay	for	more	than	five	minutes.	He	would
go	to	the	gym,	exercise	for	five	minutes,	and	leave	as	soon	as	his	time
was	up.	After	a	few	weeks,	he	looked	around	and	thought,	“Well,	I’m
always	coming	here	anyway.	I	might	as	well	start	staying	a	little
longer.”	A	few	years	later,	the	weight	was	gone.

Journaling	provides	another	example.	Nearly	everyone	can	benefit
from	getting	their	thoughts	out	of	their	head	and	onto	paper,	but	most
people	give	up	after	a	few	days	or	avoid	it	entirely	because	journaling
feels	like	a	chore.*	The	secret	is	to	always	stay	below	the	point	where	it
feels	like	work.	Greg	McKeown,	a	leadership	consultant	from	the
United	Kingdom,	built	a	daily	journaling	habit	by	specifically	writing
less	than	he	felt	like.	He	always	stopped	journaling	before	it	seemed
like	a	hassle.	Ernest	Hemingway	believed	in	similar	advice	for	any	kind
of	writing.	“The	best	way	is	to	always	stop	when	you	are	going	good,”
he	said.

Strategies	like	this	work	for	another	reason,	too:	they	reinforce	the
identity	you	want	to	build.	If	you	show	up	at	the	gym	five	days	in	a	row
—even	if	it’s	just	for	two	minutes—you	are	casting	votes	for	your	new
identity.	You’re	not	worried	about	getting	in	shape.	You’re	focused	on
becoming	the	type	of	person	who	doesn’t	miss	workouts.	You’re	taking
the	smallest	action	that	confirms	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be.

We	rarely	think	about	change	this	way	because	everyone	is
consumed	by	the	end	goal.	But	one	push-up	is	better	than	not
exercising.	One	minute	of	guitar	practice	is	better	than	none	at	all.	One
minute	of	reading	is	better	than	never	picking	up	a	book.	It’s	better	to
do	less	than	you	hoped	than	to	do	nothing	at	all.

At	some	point,	once	you’ve	established	the	habit	and	you’re	showing

up	each	day,	you	can	combine	the	Two-Minute	Rule	with	a	technique
we	call	habit	shaping	to	scale	your	habit	back	up	toward	your	ultimate
goal.	Start	by	mastering	the	first	two	minutes	of	the	smallest	version	of
the	behavior.	Then,	advance	to	an	intermediate	step	and	repeat	the
process—focusing	on	just	the	first	two	minutes	and	mastering	that
stage	before	moving	on	to	the	next	level.	Eventually,	you’ll	end	up	with

the	habit	you	had	originally	hoped	to	build	while	still	keeping	your
focus	where	it	should	be:	on	the	first	two	minutes	of	the	behavior.

EXAMPLES	OF	HABIT	SHAPING

Becoming	an	Early	Riser

Phase	1:	Be	home	by	10	p.m.	every	night.

Phase	2:	Have	all	devices	(TV,	phone,	etc.)	turned	off	by	10	p.m.	every	night.

Phase	3:	Be	in	bed	by	10	p.m.	every	night	(reading	a	book,	talking	with	your	partner).

Phase	4:	Lights	off	by	10	p.m.	every	night.

Phase	5:	Wake	up	at	6	a.m.	every	day.

Becoming	Vegan

Phase	1:	Start	eating	vegetables	at	each	meal.

Phase	2:	Stop	eating	animals	with	four	legs	(cow,	pig,	lamb,	etc.).

Phase	3:	Stop	eating	animals	with	two	legs	(chicken,	turkey,	etc.).

Phase	4:	Stop	eating	animals	with	no	legs	(fish,	clams,	scallops,	etc.).

Phase	5:	Stop	eating	all	animal	products	(eggs,	milk,	cheese).

Starting	to	Exercise

Phase	1:	Change	into	workout	clothes.

Phase	2:	Step	out	the	door	(try	taking	a	walk).

Phase	3:	Drive	to	the	gym,	exercise	for	five	minutes,	and	leave.

Phase	4:	Exercise	for	fifteen	minutes	at	least	once	per	week.

Phase	5:	Exercise	three	times	per	week.

Nearly	any	larger	life	goal	can	be	transformed	into	a	two-minute
behavior.	I	want	to	live	a	healthy	and	long	life	>	I	need	to	stay	in	shape
>	I	need	to	exercise	>	I	need	to	change	into	my	workout	clothes.	I	want
to	have	a	happy	marriage	>	I	need	to	be	a	good	partner	>	I	should	do
something	each	day	to	make	my	partner’s	life	easier	>	I	should	meal
plan	for	next	week.

Whenever	you	are	struggling	to	stick	with	a	habit,	you	can	employ

the	Two-Minute	Rule.	It’s	a	simple	way	to	make	your	habits	easy.

Chapter	Summary

Habits	can	be	completed	in	a	few	seconds	but	continue	to	impact
your	behavior	for	minutes	or	hours	afterward.

Many	habits	occur	at	decisive	moments—choices	that	are	like	a
fork	in	the	road—and	either	send	you	in	the	direction	of	a

productive	day	or	an	unproductive	one.

The	Two-Minute	Rule	states,	“When	you	start	a	new	habit,	it
should	take	less	than	two	minutes	to	do.”

The	more	you	ritualize	the	beginning	of	a	process,	the	more	likely
it	becomes	that	you	can	slip	into	the	state	of	deep	focus	that	is
required	to	do	great	things.

Standardize	before	you	optimize.	You	can’t	improve	a	habit	that
doesn’t	exist.

How	to	Make	Good	Habits	Inevitable	and
Bad	Habits	Impossible

I

N	THE	SUMMER	OF	1830,	Victor	Hugo	was	facing	an	impossible	deadline.
Twelve	months	earlier,	the	French	author	had	promised	his
publisher	a	new	book.	But	instead	of	writing,	he	spent	that	year
pursuing	other	projects,	entertaining	guests,	and	delaying	his	work.
Frustrated,	Hugo’s	publisher	responded	by	setting	a	deadline	less	than
six	months	away.	The	book	had	to	be	finished	by	February	1831.

Hugo	concocted	a	strange	plan	to	beat	his	procrastination.	He
collected	all	of	his	clothes	and	asked	an	assistant	to	lock	them	away	in
a	large	chest.	He	was	left	with	nothing	to	wear	except	a	large	shawl.
Lacking	any	suitable	clothing	to	go	outdoors,	he	remained	in	his	study
and	wrote	furiously	during	the	fall	and	winter	of	1830.	The	Hunchback
of	Notre	Dame	was	published	two	weeks	early	on	January	14,	1831.*

Sometimes	success	is	less	about	making	good	habits	easy	and	more

about	making	bad	habits	hard.	This	is	an	inversion	of	the	3rd	Law	of
Behavior	Change:	make	it	difficult.	If	you	find	yourself	continually
struggling	to	follow	through	on	your	plans,	then	you	can	take	a	page
from	Victor	Hugo	and	make	your	bad	habits	more	difficult	by	creating
what	psychologists	call	a	commitment	device.

A	commitment	device	is	a	choice	you	make	in	the	present	that

controls	your	actions	in	the	future.	It	is	a	way	to	lock	in	future
behavior,	bind	you	to	good	habits,	and	restrict	you	from	bad	ones.
When	Victor	Hugo	shut	his	clothes	away	so	he	could	focus	on	writing,
he	was	creating	a	commitment	device.*

There	are	many	ways	to	create	a	commitment	device.	You	can
reduce	overeating	by	purchasing	food	in	individual	packages	rather
than	in	bulk	size.	You	can	voluntarily	ask	to	be	added	to	the	banned	list
at	casinos	and	online	poker	sites	to	prevent	future	gambling	sprees.
I’ve	even	heard	of	athletes	who	have	to	“make	weight”	for	a
competition	choosing	to	leave	their	wallets	at	home	during	the	week
before	weigh-in	so	they	won’t	be	tempted	to	buy	fast	food.

As	another	example,	my	friend	and	fellow	habits	expert	Nir	Eyal

purchased	an	outlet	timer,	which	is	an	adapter	that	he	plugged	in
between	his	internet	router	and	the	power	outlet.	At	10	p.m.	each
night,	the	outlet	timer	cuts	off	the	power	to	the	router.	When	the
internet	goes	off,	everyone	knows	it	is	time	to	go	to	bed.

Commitment	devices	are	useful	because	they	enable	you	to	take
advantage	of	good	intentions	before	you	can	fall	victim	to	temptation.
Whenever	I’m	looking	to	cut	calories,	for	example,	I	will	ask	the	waiter
to	split	my	meal	and	box	half	of	it	to	go	before	the	meal	is	served.	If	I
waited	until	the	meal	came	out	and	told	myself	“I’ll	just	eat	half,”	it
would	never	work.

The	key	is	to	change	the	task	such	that	it	requires	more	work	to	get

out	of	the	good	habit	than	to	get	started	on	it.	If	you’re	feeling
motivated	to	get	in	shape,	schedule	a	yoga	session	and	pay	ahead	of
time.	If	you’re	excited	about	the	business	you	want	to	start,	email	an
entrepreneur	you	respect	and	set	up	a	consulting	call.	When	the	time
comes	to	act,	the	only	way	to	bail	is	to	cancel	the	meeting,	which
requires	effort	and	may	cost	money.

Commitment	devices	increase	the	odds	that	you’ll	do	the	right	thing

in	the	future	by	making	bad	habits	difficult	in	the	present.	However,
we	can	do	even	better.	We	can	make	good	habits	inevitable	and	bad
habits	impossible.

HOW	TO	AUTOMATE	A	HABIT	AND	NEVER	THINK	ABOUT	IT
AGAIN

John	Henry	Patterson	was	born	in	Dayton,	Ohio,	in	1844.	He	spent	his
childhood	doing	chores	on	the	family	farm	and	working	shifts	at	his
father’s	sawmill.	After	attending	college	at	Dartmouth,	Patterson
returned	to	Ohio	and	opened	a	small	supply	store	for	coal	miners.

It	seemed	like	a	good	opportunity.	The	store	faced	little	competition

and	enjoyed	a	steady	stream	of	customers,	but	still	struggled	to	make
money.	That	was	when	Patterson	discovered	his	employees	were
stealing	from	him.

In	the	mid-1800s,	employee	theft	was	a	common	problem.	Receipts

were	kept	in	an	open	drawer	and	could	easily	be	altered	or	discarded.
There	were	no	video	cameras	to	review	behavior	and	no	software	to
track	transactions.	Unless	you	were	willing	to	hover	over	your
employees	every	minute	of	the	day,	or	to	manage	all	transactions
yourself,	it	was	difficult	to	prevent	theft.

As	Patterson	mulled	over	his	predicament,	he	came	across	an

advertisement	for	a	new	invention	called	Ritty’s	Incorruptible	Cashier.
Designed	by	fellow	Dayton	resident	James	Ritty,	it	was	the	first	cash
register.	The	machine	automatically	locked	the	cash	and	receipts	inside
after	each	transaction.	Patterson	bought	two	for	fifty	dollars	each.

Employee	theft	at	his	store	vanished	overnight.	In	the	next	six
months,	Patterson’s	business	went	from	losing	money	to	making
$5,000	in	profit—the	equivalent	of	more	than	$100,000	today.

Patterson	was	so	impressed	with	the	machine	that	he	changed
businesses.	He	bought	the	rights	to	Ritty’s	invention	and	opened	the
National	Cash	Register	Company.	Ten	years	later,	National	Cash
Register	had	over	one	thousand	employees	and	was	on	its	way	to
becoming	one	of	the	most	successful	businesses	of	its	time.

The	best	way	to	break	a	bad	habit	is	to	make	it	impractical	to	do.
Increase	the	friction	until	you	don’t	even	have	the	option	to	act.	The
brilliance	of	the	cash	register	was	that	it	automated	ethical	behavior	by
making	stealing	practically	impossible.	Rather	than	trying	to	change
the	employees,	it	made	the	preferred	behavior	automatic.

Some	actions—like	installing	a	cash	register—pay	off	again	and
again.	These	onetime	choices	require	a	little	bit	of	effort	up	front	but
create	increasing	value	over	time.	I’m	fascinated	by	the	idea	that	a
single	choice	can	deliver	returns	again	and	again,	and	I	surveyed	my
readers	on	their	favorite	onetime	actions	that	lead	to	better	long-term
habits.	The	table	on	the	following	page	shares	some	of	the	most
popular	answers.

I’d	wager	that	if	the	average	person	were	to	simply	do	half	of	the
onetime	actions	on	this	list—even	if	they	didn’t	give	another	thought	to

their	habits—most	would	find	themselves	living	a	better	life	a	year
from	now.	These	onetime	actions	are	a	straightforward	way	to	employ
the	3rd	Law	of	Behavior	Change.	They	make	it	easier	to	sleep	well,	eat
healthy,	be	productive,	save	money,	and	generally	live	better.

Finance

Of	course,	there	are	many	ways	to	automate	good	habits	and

eliminate	bad	ones.	Typically,	they	involve	putting	technology	to	work
for	you.	Technology	can	transform	actions	that	were	once	hard,
annoying,	and	complicated	into	behaviors	that	are	easy,	painless,	and
simple.	It	is	the	most	reliable	and	effective	way	to	guarantee	the	right
behavior.

This	is	particularly	useful	for	behaviors	that	happen	too

infrequently	to	become	habitual.	Things	you	have	to	do	monthly	or
yearly—like	rebalancing	your	investment	portfolio—are	never	repeated
frequently	enough	to	become	a	habit,	so	they	benefit	in	particular	from
technology	“remembering”	to	do	them	for	you.

Other	examples	include:

Medicine:	Prescriptions	can	be	automatically	refilled.

Personal	finance:	Employees	can	save	for	retirement	with	an
automatic	wage	deduction.

Cooking:	Meal-delivery	services	can	do	your	grocery	shopping.

Productivity:	Social	media	browsing	can	be	cut	off	with	a	website
blocker.

When	you	automate	as	much	of	your	life	as	possible,	you	can	spend

your	effort	on	the	tasks	machines	cannot	do	yet.	Each	habit	that	we
hand	over	to	the	authority	of	technology	frees	up	time	and	energy	to
pour	into	the	next	stage	of	growth.	As	mathematician	and	philosopher
Alfred	North	Whitehead	wrote,	“Civilization	advances	by	extending	the
number	of	operations	we	can	perform	without	thinking	about	them.”

Of	course,	the	power	of	technology	can	work	against	us	as	well.

Binge-watching	becomes	a	habit	because	you	have	to	put	more	effort	in
to	stop	looking	at	the	screen	than	to	continue	doing	so.	Instead	of
pressing	a	button	to	advance	to	the	next	episode,	Netflix	or	YouTube
will	autoplay	it	for	you.	All	you	have	to	do	is	keep	your	eyes	open.

Technology	creates	a	level	of	convenience	that	enables	you	to	act	on

your	smallest	whims	and	desires.	At	the	mere	suggestion	of	hunger,
you	can	have	food	delivered	to	your	door.	At	the	slightest	hint	of
boredom,	you	can	get	lost	in	the	vast	expanse	of	social	media.	When
the	effort	required	to	act	on	your	desires	becomes	effectively	zero,	you
can	find	yourself	slipping	into	whatever	impulse	arises	at	the	moment.
The	downside	of	automation	is	that	we	can	find	ourselves	jumping
from	easy	task	to	easy	task	without	making	time	for	more	difficult,	but
ultimately	more	rewarding,	work.

I	often	find	myself	gravitating	toward	social	media	during	any
downtime.	If	I	feel	bored	for	just	a	fraction	of	a	second,	I	reach	for	my
phone.	It’s	easy	to	write	off	these	minor	distractions	as	“just	taking	a

break,”	but	over	time	they	can	accumulate	into	a	serious	issue.	The
constant	tug	of	“just	one	more	minute”	can	prevent	me	from	doing
anything	of	consequence.	(I’m	not	the	only	one.	The	average	person
spends	over	two	hours	per	day	on	social	media.	What	could	you	do
with	an	extra	six	hundred	hours	per	year?)

During	the	year	I	was	writing	this	book,	I	experimented	with	a	new

time	management	strategy.	Every	Monday,	my	assistant	would	reset
the	passwords	on	all	my	social	media	accounts,	which	logged	me	out
on	each	device.	All	week	I	worked	without	distraction.	On	Friday,	she
would	send	me	the	new	passwords.	I	had	the	entire	weekend	to	enjoy
what	social	media	had	to	offer	until	Monday	morning	when	she	would
do	it	again.	(If	you	don’t	have	an	assistant,	team	up	with	a	friend	or
family	member	and	reset	each	other’s	passwords	each	week.)

One	of	the	biggest	surprises	was	how	quickly	I	adapted.	Within	the
first	week	of	locking	myself	out	of	social	media,	I	realized	that	I	didn’t
need	to	check	it	nearly	as	often	as	I	had	been,	and	I	certainly	didn’t
need	it	each	day.	It	had	simply	been	so	easy	that	it	had	become	the
default.	Once	my	bad	habit	became	impossible,	I	discovered	that	I	did
actually	have	the	motivation	to	work	on	more	meaningful	tasks.	After	I
removed	the	mental	candy	from	my	environment,	it	became	much
easier	to	eat	the	healthy	stuff.

When	working	in	your	favor,	automation	can	make	your	good	habits
inevitable	and	your	bad	habits	impossible.	It	is	the	ultimate	way	to	lock
in	future	behavior	rather	than	relying	on	willpower	in	the	moment.	By
utilizing	commitment	devices,	strategic	onetime	decisions,	and
technology,	you	can	create	an	environment	of	inevitability—a	space
where	good	habits	are	not	just	an	outcome	you	hope	for	but	an
outcome	that	is	virtually	guaranteed.

Chapter	Summary

The	inversion	of	the	3rd	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	make	it
difficult.

A	commitment	device	is	a	choice	you	make	in	the	present	that
locks	in	better	behavior	in	the	future.

The	ultimate	way	to	lock	in	future	behavior	is	to	automate	your
habits.

Onetime	choices—like	buying	a	better	mattress	or	enrolling	in	an
automatic	savings	plan—are	single	actions	that	automate	your
future	habits	and	deliver	increasing	returns	over	time.

Using	technology	to	automate	your	habits	is	the	most	reliable	and
effective	way	to	guarantee	the	right	behavior.

HOW	TO	CREATE	A	GOOD	HABIT

The	1st	Law:	Make	It	Obvious

1.1:	Fill	out	the	Habits	Scorecard.	Write	down	your	current	habits	to	become	aware	of	them.

1.2:	Use	implementation	intentions:	“I	will	[BEHAVIOR]	at	[TIME]	in	[LOCATION].”

1.3:	Use	habit	stacking:	“After	[CURRENT	HABIT],	I	will	[NEW	HABIT].”

1.4:	Design	your	environment.	Make	the	cues	of	good	habits	obvious	and	visible.

The	2nd	Law:	Make	It	Attractive

2.1:	Use	temptation	bundling.	Pair	an	action	you	want	to	do	with	an	action	you	need	to	do.

2.2:	Join	a	culture	where	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal	behavior.

2.3:	Create	a	motivation	ritual.	Do	something	you	enjoy	immediately	before	a	difficult	habit.

The	3rd	Law:	Make	It	Easy

3.1:	Reduce	friction.	Decrease	the	number	of	steps	between	you	and	your	good	habits.

3.2:	Prime	the	environment.	Prepare	your	environment	to	make	future	actions	easier.

3.3:	Master	the	decisive	moment.	Optimize	the	small	choices	that	deliver	outsized	impact.

3.4:	Use	the	Two-Minute	Rule.	Downscale	your	habits	until	they	can	be	done	in	two	minutes

or	less.

3.5:	Automate	your	habits.	Invest	in	technology	and	onetime	purchases	that	lock	in	future

behavior.

The	4th	Law:	Make	It	Satisfying

HOW	TO	BREAK	A	BAD	HABIT

Inversion	of	the	1st	Law:	Make	It	Invisible

Make	It	Satisfying

15

The	Cardinal	Rule	of	Behavior	Change

I

N	THE	LATE	1990S,	a	public	health	worker	named	Stephen	Luby	left	his
hometown	of	Omaha,	Nebraska,	and	bought	a	one-way	ticket	to

Karachi,	Pakistan.

Karachi	was	one	of	the	most	populous	cities	in	the	world.	By	1998,
over	nine	million	people	called	it	home.	It	was	the	economic	center	of
Pakistan	and	a	transportation	hub,	with	some	of	the	most	active
airports	and	seaports	in	the	region.	In	the	commercial	parts	of	town,
you	could	find	all	of	the	standard	urban	amenities	and	bustling
downtown	streets.	But	Karachi	was	also	one	of	the	least	livable	cities	in
the	world.

Over	60	percent	of	Karachi’s	residents	lived	in	squatter	settlements

and	slums.	These	densely	packed	neighborhoods	were	filled	with
makeshift	houses	cobbled	together	from	old	boards,	cinder	blocks,	and
other	discarded	materials.	There	was	no	waste	removal	system,	no
electricity	grid,	no	clean	water	supply.	When	dry,	the	streets	were	a
combination	of	dust	and	trash.	When	wet,	they	became	a	muddy	pit	of
sewage.	Mosquito	colonies	thrived	in	pools	of	stagnant	water,	and
children	played	among	the	garbage.

The	unsanitary	conditions	lead	to	widespread	illness	and	disease.
Contaminated	water	sources	caused	epidemics	of	diarrhea,	vomiting,
and	abdominal	pain.	Nearly	one	third	of	the	children	living	there	were
malnourished.	With	so	many	people	crammed	into	such	a	small	space,
viruses	and	bacterial	infections	spread	rapidly.	It	was	this	public	health
crisis	that	had	brought	Stephen	Luby	to	Pakistan.

Luby	and	his	team	realized	that	in	an	environment	with	poor
sanitation,	the	simple	habit	of	washing	your	hands	could	make	a	real

difference	in	the	health	of	the	residents.	But	they	soon	discovered	that
many	people	were	already	aware	that	handwashing	was	important.

And	yet,	despite	this	knowledge,	many	residents	were	washing	their
hands	in	a	haphazard	fashion.	Some	people	would	just	run	their	hands
under	the	water	quickly.	Others	would	only	wash	one	hand.	Many
would	simply	forget	to	wash	their	hands	before	preparing	food.
Everyone	said	handwashing	was	important,	but	few	people	made	a
habit	out	of	it.	The	problem	wasn’t	knowledge.	The	problem	was
consistency.

That	was	when	Luby	and	his	team	partnered	with	Procter	&	Gamble

to	supply	the	neighborhood	with	Safeguard	soap.	Compared	to	your
standard	bar	of	soap,	using	Safeguard	was	a	more	enjoyable
experience.

“In	Pakistan,	Safeguard	was	a	premium	soap,”	Luby	told	me.	“The
study	participants	commonly	mentioned	how	much	they	liked	it.”	The
soap	foamed	easily,	and	people	were	able	to	lather	their	hands	with
suds.	It	smelled	great.	Instantly,	handwashing	became	slightly	more
pleasurable.

“I	see	the	goal	of	handwashing	promotion	not	as	behavior	change
but	as	habit	adoption,”	Luby	said.	“It	is	a	lot	easier	for	people	to	adopt
a	product	that	provides	a	strong	positive	sensory	signal,	for	example
the	mint	taste	of	toothpaste,	than	it	is	to	adopt	a	habit	that	does	not
provide	pleasurable	sensory	feedback,	like	flossing	one’s	teeth.	The
marketing	team	at	Procter	&	Gamble	talked	about	trying	to	create	a
positive	handwashing	experience.”

Within	months,	the	researchers	saw	a	rapid	shift	in	the	health	of
children	in	the	neighborhood.	The	rate	of	diarrhea	fell	by	52	percent;
pneumonia	by	48	percent;	and	impetigo,	a	bacterial	skin	infection,	by
35	percent.

The	long-term	effects	were	even	better.	“We	went	back	to	some	of

the	households	in	Karachi	six	years	after,”	Luby	told	me.	“Over	95
percent	of	households	who	had	been	given	the	soap	for	free	and
encouraged	to	wash	their	hands	had	a	handwashing	station	with	soap
and	water	available	when	our	study	team	visited.	.	.	.	We	had	not	given
any	soap	to	the	intervention	group	for	over	five	years,	but	during	the
trial	they	had	become	so	habituated	to	wash	their	hands,	that	they	had

maintained	the	practice.”	It	was	a	powerful	example	of	the	fourth	and
final	Law	of	Behavior	Change:	make	it	satisfying.

We	are	more	likely	to	repeat	a	behavior	when	the	experience	is
satisfying.	This	is	entirely	logical.	Feelings	of	pleasure—even	minor
ones	like	washing	your	hands	with	soap	that	smells	nice	and	lathers
well—are	signals	that	tell	the	brain:	“This	feels	good.	Do	this	again,
next	time.”	Pleasure	teaches	your	brain	that	a	behavior	is	worth
remembering	and	repeating.

Take	the	story	of	chewing	gum.	Chewing	gum	had	been	sold
commercially	throughout	the	1800s,	but	it	wasn’t	until	Wrigley
launched	in	1891	that	it	became	a	worldwide	habit.	Early	versions	were
made	from	relatively	bland	resins—chewy,	but	not	tasty.	Wrigley
revolutionized	the	industry	by	adding	flavors	like	Spearmint	and	Juicy
Fruit,	which	made	the	product	flavorful	and	fun	to	use.	Then	they	went
a	step	further	and	began	pushing	chewing	gum	as	a	pathway	to	a	clean
mouth.	Advertisements	told	readers	to	“Refresh	Your	Taste.”

Tasty	flavors	and	the	feeling	of	a	fresh	mouth	provided	little	bits	of

immediate	reinforcement	and	made	the	product	satisfying	to	use.
Consumption	skyrocketed,	and	Wrigley	became	the	largest	chewing
gum	company	in	the	world.

Toothpaste	had	a	similar	trajectory.	Manufacturers	enjoyed	great

success	when	they	added	flavors	like	spearmint,	peppermint,	and
cinnamon	to	their	products.	These	flavors	don’t	improve	the
effectiveness	of	toothpaste.	They	simply	create	a	“clean	mouth”	feel
and	make	the	experience	of	brushing	your	teeth	more	pleasurable.	My
wife	actually	stopped	using	Sensodyne	because	she	didn’t	like	the
aftertaste.	She	switched	to	a	brand	with	a	stronger	mint	flavor,	which
proved	to	be	more	satisfying.

Conversely,	if	an	experience	is	not	satisfying,	we	have	little	reason	to

repeat	it.	In	my	research,	I	came	across	the	story	of	a	woman	who	had
a	narcissistic	relative	who	drove	her	nuts.	In	an	attempt	to	spend	less
time	with	this	egomaniac,	she	acted	as	dull	and	as	boring	as	possible
whenever	he	was	around.	Within	a	few	encounters,	he	started	avoiding
her	because	he	found	her	so	uninteresting.

Stories	like	these	are	evidence	of	the	Cardinal	Rule	of	Behavior
Change:	What	is	rewarded	is	repeated.	What	is	punished	is	avoided.
You	learn	what	to	do	in	the	future	based	on	what	you	were	rewarded

for	doing	(or	punished	for	doing)	in	the	past.	Positive	emotions
cultivate	habits.	Negative	emotions	destroy	them.

The	first	three	laws	of	behavior	change—make	it	obvious,	make	it
attractive,	and	make	it	easy—increase	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	be
performed	this	time.	The	fourth	law	of	behavior	change—make	it
satisfying—increases	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	be	repeated	next
time.	It	completes	the	habit	loop.

But	there	is	a	trick.	We	are	not	looking	for	just	any	type	of

satisfaction.	We	are	looking	for	immediate	satisfaction.

THE	MISMATCH	BETWEEN	IMMEDIATE	AND	DELAYED
REWARDS

Imagine	you’re	an	animal	roaming	the	plains	of	Africa—a	giraffe	or	an
elephant	or	a	lion.	On	any	given	day,	most	of	your	decisions	have	an
immediate	impact.	You	are	always	thinking	about	what	to	eat	or	where
to	sleep	or	how	to	avoid	a	predator.	You	are	constantly	focused	on	the
present	or	the	very	near	future.	You	live	in	what	scientists	call	an
immediate-return	environment	because	your	actions	instantly	deliver
clear	and	immediate	outcomes.

Now	switch	back	to	your	human	self.	In	modern	society,	many	of
the	choices	you	make	today	will	not	benefit	you	immediately.	If	you	do
a	good	job	at	work,	you’ll	get	a	paycheck	in	a	few	weeks.	If	you	exercise
today,	perhaps	you	won’t	be	overweight	next	year.	If	you	save	money
now,	maybe	you’ll	have	enough	for	retirement	decades	from	now.	You
live	in	what	scientists	call	a	delayed-return	environment	because	you
can	work	for	years	before	your	actions	deliver	the	intended	payoff.

The	human	brain	did	not	evolve	for	life	in	a	delayed-return
environment.	The	earliest	remains	of	modern	humans,	known	as
Homo	sapiens	sapiens,	are	approximately	two	hundred	thousand	years
old.	These	were	the	first	humans	to	have	a	brain	relatively	similar	to
ours.	In	particular,	the	neocortex—the	newest	part	of	the	brain	and	the
region	responsible	for	higher	functions	like	language—was	roughly	the
same	size	two	hundred	thousand	years	ago	as	today.	You	are	walking
around	with	the	same	hardware	as	your	Paleolithic	ancestors.

It	is	only	recently—during	the	last	five	hundred	years	or	so—that
society	has	shifted	to	a	predominantly	delayed-return	environment.*

Compared	to	the	age	of	the	brain,	modern	society	is	brand-new.	In	the
last	one	hundred	years,	we	have	seen	the	rise	of	the	car,	the	airplane,
the	television,	the	personal	computer,	the	internet,	the	smartphone,
and	Beyoncé.	The	world	has	changed	much	in	recent	years,	but	human
nature	has	changed	little.

Similar	to	other	animals	on	the	African	savannah,	our	ancestors
spent	their	days	responding	to	grave	threats,	securing	the	next	meal,
and	taking	shelter	from	a	storm.	It	made	sense	to	place	a	high	value	on
instant	gratification.	The	distant	future	was	less	of	a	concern.	And	after
thousands	of	generations	in	an	immediate-return	environment,	our
brains	evolved	to	prefer	quick	payoffs	to	long-term	ones.

Behavioral	economists	refer	to	this	tendency	as	time	inconsistency.

That	is,	the	way	your	brain	evaluates	rewards	is	inconsistent	across
time.*	You	value	the	present	more	than	the	future.	Usually,	this
tendency	serves	us	well.	A	reward	that	is	certain	right	now	is	typically
worth	more	than	one	that	is	merely	possible	in	the	future.	But
occasionally,	our	bias	toward	instant	gratification	causes	problems.

Why	would	someone	smoke	if	they	know	it	increases	the	risk	of	lung
cancer?	Why	would	someone	overeat	when	they	know	it	increases	their
risk	of	obesity?	Why	would	someone	have	unsafe	sex	if	they	know	it
can	result	in	sexually	transmitted	disease?	Once	you	understand	how
the	brain	prioritizes	rewards,	the	answers	become	clear:	the
consequences	of	bad	habits	are	delayed	while	the	rewards	are
immediate.	Smoking	might	kill	you	in	ten	years,	but	it	reduces	stress
and	eases	your	nicotine	cravings	now.	Overeating	is	harmful	in	the
long	run	but	appetizing	in	the	moment.	Sex—safe	or	not—provides
pleasure	right	away.	Disease	and	infection	won’t	show	up	for	days	or
weeks,	even	years.

Every	habit	produces	multiple	outcomes	across	time.	Unfortunately,

these	outcomes	are	often	misaligned.	With	our	bad	habits,	the
immediate	outcome	usually	feels	good,	but	the	ultimate	outcome	feels
bad.	With	good	habits,	it	is	the	reverse:	the	immediate	outcome	is
unenjoyable,	but	the	ultimate	outcome	feels	good.	The	French
economist	Frédéric	Bastiat	explained	the	problem	clearly	when	he
wrote,	“It	almost	always	happens	that	when	the	immediate
consequence	is	favorable,	the	later	consequences	are	disastrous,	and
vice	versa.	.	.	.	Often,	the	sweeter	the	first	fruit	of	a	habit,	the	more
bitter	are	its	later	fruits.”

Put	another	way,	the	costs	of	your	good	habits	are	in	the	present.

The	costs	of	your	bad	habits	are	in	the	future.

The	brain’s	tendency	to	prioritize	the	present	moment	means	you
can’t	rely	on	good	intentions.	When	you	make	a	plan—to	lose	weight,
write	a	book,	or	learn	a	language—you	are	actually	making	plans	for
your	future	self.	And	when	you	envision	what	you	want	your	life	to	be
like,	it	is	easy	to	see	the	value	in	taking	actions	with	long-term	benefits.
We	all	want	better	lives	for	our	future	selves.	However,	when	the
moment	of	decision	arrives,	instant	gratification	usually	wins.	You	are
no	longer	making	a	choice	for	Future	You,	who	dreams	of	being	fitter
or	wealthier	or	happier.	You	are	choosing	for	Present	You,	who	wants
to	be	full,	pampered,	and	entertained.	As	a	general	rule,	the	more
immediate	pleasure	you	get	from	an	action,	the	more	strongly	you
should	question	whether	it	aligns	with	your	long-term	goals.*

With	a	fuller	understanding	of	what	causes	our	brain	to	repeat	some
behaviors	and	avoid	others,	let’s	update	the	Cardinal	Rule	of	Behavior
Change:	What	is	immediately	rewarded	is	repeated.	What	is
immediately	punished	is	avoided.

Our	preference	for	instant	gratification	reveals	an	important	truth
about	success:	because	of	how	we	are	wired,	most	people	will	spend	all
day	chasing	quick	hits	of	satisfaction.	The	road	less	traveled	is	the	road
of	delayed	gratification.	If	you’re	willing	to	wait	for	the	rewards,	you’ll
face	less	competition	and	often	get	a	bigger	payoff.	As	the	saying	goes,
the	last	mile	is	always	the	least	crowded.

This	is	precisely	what	research	has	shown.	People	who	are	better	at
delaying	gratification	have	higher	SAT	scores,	lower	levels	of	substance
abuse,	lower	likelihood	of	obesity,	better	responses	to	stress,	and
superior	social	skills.	We’ve	all	seen	this	play	out	in	our	own	lives.	If
you	delay	watching	television	and	get	your	homework	done,	you’ll
generally	learn	more	and	get	better	grades.	If	you	don’t	buy	desserts
and	chips	at	the	store,	you’ll	often	eat	healthier	food	when	you	get
home.	At	some	point,	success	in	nearly	every	field	requires	you	to
ignore	an	immediate	reward	in	favor	of	a	delayed	reward.

Here’s	the	problem:	most	people	know	that	delaying	gratification	is

the	wise	approach.	They	want	the	benefits	of	good	habits:	to	be
healthy,	productive,	at	peace.	But	these	outcomes	are	seldom	top-of-
mind	at	the	decisive	moment.	Thankfully,	it’s	possible	to	train	yourself
to	delay	gratification—but	you	need	to	work	with	the	grain	of	human

nature,	not	against	it.	The	best	way	to	do	this	is	to	add	a	little	bit	of
immediate	pleasure	to	the	habits	that	pay	off	in	the	long-run	and	a
little	bit	of	immediate	pain	to	ones	that	don’t.

HOW	TO	TURN	INSTANT	GRATIFICATION	TO	YOUR	ADVANTAGE

The	vital	thing	in	getting	a	habit	to	stick	is	to	feel	successful—even	if
it’s	in	a	small	way.	The	feeling	of	success	is	a	signal	that	your	habit	paid
off	and	that	the	work	was	worth	the	effort.

In	a	perfect	world,	the	reward	for	a	good	habit	is	the	habit	itself.	In
the	real	world,	good	habits	tend	to	feel	worthwhile	only	after	they	have
provided	you	with	something.	Early	on,	it’s	all	sacrifice.	You’ve	gone	to
the	gym	a	few	times,	but	you’re	not	stronger	or	fitter	or	faster—at	least,
not	in	any	noticeable	sense.	It’s	only	months	later,	once	you	shed	a	few
pounds	or	your	arms	gain	some	definition,	that	it	becomes	easier	to
exercise	for	its	own	sake.	In	the	beginning,	you	need	a	reason	to	stay
on	track.	This	is	why	immediate	rewards	are	essential.	They	keep	you
excited	while	the	delayed	rewards	accumulate	in	the	background.

What	we’re	really	talking	about	here—when	we’re	discussing
immediate	rewards—is	the	ending	of	a	behavior.	The	ending	of	any
experience	is	vital	because	we	tend	to	remember	it	more	than	other
phases.	You	want	the	ending	of	your	habit	to	be	satisfying.	The	best
approach	is	to	use	reinforcement,	which	refers	to	the	process	of	using
an	immediate	reward	to	increase	the	rate	of	a	behavior.	Habit	stacking,
which	we	covered	in	Chapter	5,	ties	your	habit	to	an	immediate	cue,
which	makes	it	obvious	when	to	start.	Reinforcement	ties	your	habit	to
an	immediate	reward,	which	makes	it	satisfying	when	you	finish.

Immediate	reinforcement	can	be	especially	helpful	when	dealing
with	habits	of	avoidance,	which	are	behaviors	you	want	to	stop	doing.
It	can	be	challenging	to	stick	with	habits	like	“no	frivolous	purchases”
or	“no	alcohol	this	month”	because	nothing	happens	when	you	skip
happy	hour	drinks	or	don’t	buy	that	pair	of	shoes.	It	can	be	hard	to	feel
satisfied	when	there	is	no	action	in	the	first	place.	All	you’re	doing	is
resisting	temptation,	and	there	isn’t	much	satisfying	about	that.

One	solution	is	to	turn	the	situation	on	its	head.	You	want	to	make

avoidance	visible.	Open	a	savings	account	and	label	it	for	something
you	want—maybe	“Leather	Jacket.”	Whenever	you	pass	on	a	purchase,
put	the	same	amount	of	money	in	the	account.	Skip	your	morning

latte?	Transfer	$5.	Pass	on	another	month	of	Netflix?	Move	$10	over.
It’s	like	creating	a	loyalty	program	for	yourself.	The	immediate	reward
of	seeing	yourself	save	money	toward	the	leather	jacket	feels	a	lot
better	than	being	deprived.	You	are	making	it	satisfying	to	do	nothing.

One	of	my	readers	and	his	wife	used	a	similar	setup.	They	wanted	to
stop	eating	out	so	much	and	start	cooking	together	more.	They	labeled
their	savings	account	“Trip	to	Europe.”	Whenever	they	skipped	going
out	to	eat,	they	transferred	$50	into	the	account.	At	the	end	of	the	year,
they	put	the	money	toward	the	vacation.

It	is	worth	noting	that	it	is	important	to	select	short-term	rewards

that	reinforce	your	identity	rather	than	ones	that	conflict	with	it.
Buying	a	new	jacket	is	fine	if	you’re	trying	to	lose	weight	or	read	more
books,	but	it	doesn’t	work	if	you’re	trying	to	budget	and	save	money.
Instead,	taking	a	bubble	bath	or	going	on	a	leisurely	walk	are	good
examples	of	rewarding	yourself	with	free	time,	which	aligns	with	your
ultimate	goal	of	more	freedom	and	financial	independence.	Similarly,
if	your	reward	for	exercising	is	eating	a	bowl	of	ice	cream,	then	you’re
casting	votes	for	conflicting	identities,	and	it	ends	up	being	a	wash.
Instead,	maybe	your	reward	is	a	massage,	which	is	both	a	luxury	and	a
vote	toward	taking	care	of	your	body.	Now	the	short-term	reward	is
aligned	with	your	long-term	vision	of	being	a	healthy	person.

Eventually,	as	intrinsic	rewards	like	a	better	mood,	more	energy,
and	reduced	stress	kick	in,	you’ll	become	less	concerned	with	chasing
the	secondary	reward.	The	identity	itself	becomes	the	reinforcer.	You
do	it	because	it’s	who	you	are	and	it	feels	good	to	be	you.	The	more	a
habit	becomes	part	of	your	life,	the	less	you	need	outside
encouragement	to	follow	through.	Incentives	can	start	a	habit.	Identity
sustains	a	habit.

That	said,	it	takes	time	for	the	evidence	to	accumulate	and	a	new

identity	to	emerge.	Immediate	reinforcement	helps	maintain
motivation	in	the	short	term	while	you’re	waiting	for	the	long-term
rewards	to	arrive.

In	summary,	a	habit	needs	to	be	enjoyable	for	it	to	last.	Simple	bits
of	reinforcement—like	soap	that	smells	great	or	toothpaste	that	has	a
refreshing	mint	flavor	or	seeing	$50	hit	your	savings	account—can
offer	the	immediate	pleasure	you	need	to	enjoy	a	habit.	And	change	is
easy	when	it	is	enjoyable.

How	to	Stick	with	Good	Habits	Every	Day

I

N	1993,	a	bank	in	Abbotsford,	Canada,	hired	a	twenty-three-year-old
stockbroker	named	Trent	Dyrsmid.	Abbotsford	was	a	relatively	small

suburb,	tucked	away	in	the	shadow	of	nearby	Vancouver,	where	most
of	the	big	business	deals	were	being	made.	Given	the	location,	and	the
fact	that	Dyrsmid	was	a	rookie,	nobody	expected	too	much	of	him.	But
he	made	brisk	progress	thanks	to	a	simple	daily	habit.

Dyrsmid	began	each	morning	with	two	jars	on	his	desk.	One	was
filled	with	120	paper	clips.	The	other	was	empty.	As	soon	as	he	settled
in	each	day,	he	would	make	a	sales	call.	Immediately	after,	he	would
move	one	paper	clip	from	the	full	jar	to	the	empty	jar	and	the	process
would	begin	again.	“Every	morning	I	would	start	with	120	paper	clips
in	one	jar	and	I	would	keep	dialing	the	phone	until	I	had	moved	them
all	to	the	second	jar,”	he	told	me.

Within	eighteen	months,	Dyrsmid	was	bringing	in	$5	million	to	the

firm.	By	age	twenty-four,	he	was	making	$75,000	per	year—the
equivalent	of	$125,000	today.	Not	long	after,	he	landed	a	six-figure	job
with	another	company.

I	like	to	refer	to	this	technique	as	the	Paper	Clip	Strategy	and,	over
the	years,	I’ve	heard	from	readers	who	have	employed	it	in	a	variety	of
ways.	One	woman	shifted	a	hairpin	from	one	container	to	another
whenever	she	wrote	a	page	of	her	book.	Another	man	moved	a	marble
from	one	bin	to	the	next	after	each	set	of	push-ups.

Making	progress	is	satisfying,	and	visual	measures—like	moving

paper	clips	or	hairpins	or	marbles—provide	clear	evidence	of	your
progress.	As	a	result,	they	reinforce	your	behavior	and	add	a	little	bit	of
immediate	satisfaction	to	any	activity.	Visual	measurement	comes	in

many	forms:	food	journals,	workout	logs,	loyalty	punch	cards,	the
progress	bar	on	a	software	download,	even	the	page	numbers	in	a
book.	But	perhaps	the	best	way	to	measure	your	progress	is	with	a
habit	tracker.

HOW	TO	KEEP	YOUR	HABITS	ON	TRACK

A	habit	tracker	is	a	simple	way	to	measure	whether	you	did	a	habit.
The	most	basic	format	is	to	get	a	calendar	and	cross	off	each	day	you
stick	with	your	routine.	For	example,	if	you	meditate	on	Monday,
Wednesday,	and	Friday,	each	of	those	dates	gets	an	X.	As	time	rolls	by,
the	calendar	becomes	a	record	of	your	habit	streak.

Countless	people	have	tracked	their	habits,	but	perhaps	the	most

famous	was	Benjamin	Franklin.	Beginning	at	age	twenty,	Franklin
carried	a	small	booklet	everywhere	he	went	and	used	it	to	track
thirteen	personal	virtues.	This	list	included	goals	like	“Lose	no	time.	Be
always	employed	in	something	useful”	and	“Avoid	trifling
conversation.”	At	the	end	of	each	day,	Franklin	would	open	his	booklet
and	record	his	progress.

Jerry	Seinfeld	reportedly	uses	a	habit	tracker	to	stick	with	his	streak

of	writing	jokes.	In	the	documentary	Comedian,	he	explains	that	his
goal	is	simply	to	“never	break	the	chain”	of	writing	jokes	every	day.	In
other	words,	he	is	not	focused	on	how	good	or	bad	a	particular	joke	is
or	how	inspired	he	feels.	He	is	simply	focused	on	showing	up	and
adding	to	his	streak.

“Don’t	break	the	chain”	is	a	powerful	mantra.	Don’t	break	the	chain
of	sales	calls	and	you’ll	build	a	successful	book	of	business.	Don’t	break
the	chain	of	workouts	and	you’ll	get	fit	faster	than	you’d	expect.	Don’t
break	the	chain	of	creating	every	day	and	you	will	end	up	with	an
impressive	portfolio.	Habit	tracking	is	powerful	because	it	leverages
multiple	Laws	of	Behavior	Change.	It	simultaneously	makes	a	behavior
obvious,	attractive,	and	satisfying.

Let’s	break	down	each	one.

Benefit	#1:	Habit	tracking	is	obvious.

Recording	your	last	action	creates	a	trigger	that	can	initiate	your	next
one.	Habit	tracking	naturally	builds	a	series	of	visual	cues	like	the
streak	of	X’s	on	your	calendar	or	the	list	of	meals	in	your	food	log.
When	you	look	at	the	calendar	and	see	your	streak,	you’ll	be	reminded
to	act	again.	Research	has	shown	that	people	who	track	their	progress
on	goals	like	losing	weight,	quitting	smoking,	and	lowering	blood
pressure	are	all	more	likely	to	improve	than	those	who	don’t.	One
study	of	more	than	sixteen	hundred	people	found	that	those	who	kept
a	daily	food	log	lost	twice	as	much	weight	as	those	who	did	not.	The
mere	act	of	tracking	a	behavior	can	spark	the	urge	to	change	it.

Habit	tracking	also	keeps	you	honest.	Most	of	us	have	a	distorted

view	of	our	own	behavior.	We	think	we	act	better	than	we	do.
Measurement	offers	one	way	to	overcome	our	blindness	to	our	own
behavior	and	notice	what’s	really	going	on	each	day.	One	glance	at	the
paper	clips	in	the	container	and	you	immediately	know	how	much
work	you	have	(or	haven’t)	been	putting	in.	When	the	evidence	is	right
in	front	of	you,	you’re	less	likely	to	lie	to	yourself.

Benefit	#2:	Habit	tracking	is	attractive.

The	most	effective	form	of	motivation	is	progress.	When	we	get	a
signal	that	we	are	moving	forward,	we	become	more	motivated	to
continue	down	that	path.	In	this	way,	habit	tracking	can	have	an
addictive	effect	on	motivation.	Each	small	win	feeds	your	desire.

This	can	be	particularly	powerful	on	a	bad	day.	When	you’re	feeling
down,	it’s	easy	to	forget	about	all	the	progress	you	have	already	made.
Habit	tracking	provides	visual	proof	of	your	hard	work—a	subtle
reminder	of	how	far	you’ve	come.	Plus,	the	empty	square	you	see	each
morning	can	motivate	you	to	get	started	because	you	don’t	want	to	lose
your	progress	by	breaking	the	streak.

Benefit	#3:	Habit	tracking	is	satisfying.

This	is	the	most	crucial	benefit	of	all.	Tracking	can	become	its	own
form	of	reward.	It	is	satisfying	to	cross	an	item	off	your	to-do	list,	to
complete	an	entry	in	your	workout	log,	or	to	mark	an	X	on	the
calendar.	It	feels	good	to	watch	your	results	grow—the	size	of	your

investment	portfolio,	the	length	of	your	book	manuscript—and	if	it
feels	good,	then	you’re	more	likely	to	endure.

Habit	tracking	also	helps	keep	your	eye	on	the	ball:	you’re	focused
on	the	process	rather	than	the	result.	You’re	not	fixated	on	getting	six-
pack	abs,	you’re	just	trying	to	keep	the	streak	alive	and	become	the
type	of	person	who	doesn’t	miss	workouts.

In	summary,	habit	tracking	(1)	creates	a	visual	cue	that	can	remind

you	to	act,	(2)	is	inherently	motivating	because	you	see	the	progress
you	are	making	and	don’t	want	to	lose	it,	and	(3)	feels	satisfying
whenever	you	record	another	successful	instance	of	your	habit.
Furthermore,	habit	tracking	provides	visual	proof	that	you	are	casting
votes	for	the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become,	which	is	a	delightful
form	of	immediate	and	intrinsic	gratification.*

You	may	be	wondering,	if	habit	tracking	is	so	useful,	why	have	I

waited	so	long	to	talk	about	it?

Despite	all	the	benefits,	I’ve	left	this	discussion	until	now	for	a
simple	reason:	many	people	resist	the	idea	of	tracking	and	measuring.
It	can	feel	like	a	burden	because	it	forces	you	into	two	habits:	the	habit
you’re	trying	to	build	and	the	habit	of	tracking	it.	Counting	calories
sounds	like	a	hassle	when	you’re	already	struggling	to	follow	a	diet.
Writing	down	every	sales	call	seems	tedious	when	you’ve	got	work	to
do.	It	feels	easier	to	say,	“I’ll	just	eat	less.”	Or,	“I’ll	try	harder.”	Or,	“I’ll
remember	to	do	it.”	People	inevitably	tell	me	things	like,	“I	have	a
decision	journal,	but	I	wish	I	used	it	more.”	Or,	“I	recorded	my
workouts	for	a	week,	but	then	quit.”	I’ve	been	there	myself.	I	once
made	a	food	log	to	track	my	calories.	I	managed	to	do	it	for	one	meal
and	then	gave	up.

Tracking	isn’t	for	everyone,	and	there	is	no	need	to	measure	your
entire	life.	But	nearly	anyone	can	benefit	from	it	in	some	form—even	if
it’s	only	temporary.

What	can	we	do	to	make	tracking	easier?

First,	whenever	possible,	measurement	should	be	automated.	You’ll

probably	be	surprised	by	how	much	you’re	already	tracking	without
knowing	it.	Your	credit	card	statement	tracks	how	often	you	go	out	to
eat.	Your	Fitbit	registers	how	many	steps	you	take	and	how	long	you
sleep.	Your	calendar	records	how	many	new	places	you	travel	to	each
year.	Once	you	know	where	to	get	the	data,	add	a	note	to	your	calendar

to	review	it	each	week	or	each	month,	which	is	more	practical	than
tracking	it	every	day.

Second,	manual	tracking	should	be	limited	to	your	most	important
habits.	It	is	better	to	consistently	track	one	habit	than	to	sporadically
track	ten.

Finally,	record	each	measurement	immediately	after	the	habit

occurs.	The	completion	of	the	behavior	is	the	cue	to	write	it	down.	This
approach	allows	you	to	combine	the	habit-stacking	method	mentioned
in	Chapter	5	with	habit	tracking.

The	habit	stacking	+	habit	tracking	formula	is:

After	[CURRENT	HABIT],	I	will	[TRACK	MY	HABIT].

After	I	hang	up	the	phone	from	a	sales	call,	I	will	move	one	paper
clip	over.

After	I	finish	each	set	at	the	gym,	I	will	record	it	in	my	workout
journal.

After	I	put	my	plate	in	the	dishwasher,	I	will	write	down	what	I
ate.

These	tactics	can	make	tracking	your	habits	easier.	Even	if	you
aren’t	the	type	of	person	who	enjoys	recording	your	behavior,	I	think
you’ll	find	a	few	weeks	of	measurements	to	be	insightful.	It’s	always
interesting	to	see	how	you’ve	actually	been	spending	your	time.

That	said,	every	habit	streak	ends	at	some	point.	And,	more
important	than	any	single	measurement,	is	having	a	good	plan	for
when	your	habits	slide	off	track.

HOW	TO	RECOVER	QUICKLY	WHEN	YOUR	HABITS	BREAK
DOWN

No	matter	how	consistent	you	are	with	your	habits,	it	is	inevitable	that
life	will	interrupt	you	at	some	point.	Perfection	is	not	possible.	Before
long,	an	emergency	will	pop	up—you	get	sick	or	you	have	to	travel	for
work	or	your	family	needs	a	little	more	of	your	time.

Whenever	this	happens	to	me,	I	try	to	remind	myself	of	a	simple

rule:	never	miss	twice.

If	I	miss	one	day,	I	try	to	get	back	into	it	as	quickly	as	possible.
Missing	one	workout	happens,	but	I’m	not	going	to	miss	two	in	a	row.
Maybe	I’ll	eat	an	entire	pizza,	but	I’ll	follow	it	up	with	a	healthy	meal.	I
can’t	be	perfect,	but	I	can	avoid	a	second	lapse.	As	soon	as	one	streak
ends,	I	get	started	on	the	next	one.

The	first	mistake	is	never	the	one	that	ruins	you.	It	is	the	spiral	of
repeated	mistakes	that	follows.	Missing	once	is	an	accident.	Missing
twice	is	the	start	of	a	new	habit.

This	is	a	distinguishing	feature	between	winners	and	losers.	Anyone
can	have	a	bad	performance,	a	bad	workout,	or	a	bad	day	at	work.	But
when	successful	people	fail,	they	rebound	quickly.	The	breaking	of	a
habit	doesn’t	matter	if	the	reclaiming	of	it	is	fast.

I	think	this	principle	is	so	important	that	I’ll	stick	to	it	even	if	I	can’t

do	a	habit	as	well	or	as	completely	as	I	would	like.	Too	often,	we	fall
into	an	all-or-nothing	cycle	with	our	habits.	The	problem	is	not
slipping	up;	the	problem	is	thinking	that	if	you	can’t	do	something
perfectly,	then	you	shouldn’t	do	it	at	all.

You	don’t	realize	how	valuable	it	is	to	just	show	up	on	your	bad	(or
busy)	days.	Lost	days	hurt	you	more	than	successful	days	help	you.	If
you	start	with	$100,	then	a	50	percent	gain	will	take	you	to	$150.	But
you	only	need	a	33	percent	loss	to	take	you	back	to	$100.	In	other
words,	avoiding	a	33	percent	loss	is	just	as	valuable	as	achieving	a	50
percent	gain.	As	Charlie	Munger	says,	“The	first	rule	of	compounding:
Never	interrupt	it	unnecessarily.”

This	is	why	the	“bad”	workouts	are	often	the	most	important	ones.

Sluggish	days	and	bad	workouts	maintain	the	compound	gains	you
accrued	from	previous	good	days.	Simply	doing	something—ten
squats,	five	sprints,	a	push-up,	anything	really—is	huge.	Don’t	put	up	a
zero.	Don’t	let	losses	eat	into	your	compounding.

Furthermore,	it’s	not	always	about	what	happens	during	the

workout.	It’s	about	being	the	type	of	person	who	doesn’t	miss
workouts.	It’s	easy	to	train	when	you	feel	good,	but	it’s	crucial	to	show
up	when	you	don’t	feel	like	it—even	if	you	do	less	than	you	hope.	Going
to	the	gym	for	five	minutes	may	not	improve	your	performance,	but	it
reaffirms	your	identity.

The	all-or-nothing	cycle	of	behavior	change	is	just	one	pitfall	that
can	derail	your	habits.	Another	potential	danger—especially	if	you	are

using	a	habit	tracker—is	measuring	the	wrong	thing.

KNOWING	WHEN	(AND	WHEN	NOT)	TO	TRACK	A	HABIT

Say	you’re	running	a	restaurant	and	you	want	to	know	if	your	chef	is
doing	a	good	job.	One	way	to	measure	success	is	to	track	how	many
customers	pay	for	a	meal	each	day.	If	more	customers	come	in,	the
food	must	be	good.	If	fewer	customers	come	in,	something	must	be
wrong.

However,	this	one	measurement—daily	revenue—only	gives	a
limited	picture	of	what’s	really	going	on.	Just	because	someone	pays
for	a	meal	doesn’t	mean	they	enjoy	the	meal.	Even	dissatisfied
customers	are	unlikely	to	dine	and	dash.	In	fact,	if	you’re	only
measuring	revenue,	the	food	might	be	getting	worse	but	you’re	making
up	for	it	with	marketing	or	discounts	or	some	other	method.	Instead,	it
may	be	more	effective	to	track	how	many	customers	finish	their	meal
or	perhaps	the	percentage	of	customers	who	leave	a	generous	tip.

The	dark	side	of	tracking	a	particular	behavior	is	that	we	become

driven	by	the	number	rather	than	the	purpose	behind	it.	If	your
success	is	measured	by	quarterly	earnings,	you	will	optimize	sales,
revenue,	and	accounting	for	quarterly	earnings.	If	your	success	is
measured	by	a	lower	number	on	the	scale,	you	will	optimize	for	a	lower
number	on	the	scale,	even	if	that	means	embracing	crash	diets,	juice
cleanses,	and	fat-loss	pills.	The	human	mind	wants	to	“win”	whatever
game	is	being	played.

This	pitfall	is	evident	in	many	areas	of	life.	We	focus	on	working
long	hours	instead	of	getting	meaningful	work	done.	We	care	more
about	getting	ten	thousand	steps	than	we	do	about	being	healthy.	We
teach	for	standardized	tests	instead	of	emphasizing	learning,	curiosity,
and	critical	thinking.	In	short,	we	optimize	for	what	we	measure.	When
we	choose	the	wrong	measurement,	we	get	the	wrong	behavior.

This	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	Goodhart’s	Law.	Named	after	the
economist	Charles	Goodhart,	the	principle	states,	“When	a	measure
becomes	a	target,	it	ceases	to	be	a	good	measure.”	Measurement	is	only
useful	when	it	guides	you	and	adds	context	to	a	larger	picture,	not
when	it	consumes	you.	Each	number	is	simply	one	piece	of	feedback	in
the	overall	system.

In	our	data-driven	world,	we	tend	to	overvalue	numbers	and
undervalue	anything	ephemeral,	soft,	and	difficult	to	quantify.	We
mistakenly	think	the	factors	we	can	measure	are	the	only	factors	that
exist.	But	just	because	you	can	measure	something	doesn’t	mean	it’s
the	most	important	thing.	And	just	because	you	can’t	measure
something	doesn’t	mean	it’s	not	important	at	all.

All	of	this	to	say,	it’s	crucial	to	keep	habit	tracking	in	its	proper
place.	It	can	feel	satisfying	to	record	a	habit	and	track	your	progress,
but	the	measurement	is	not	the	only	thing	that	matters.	Furthermore,
there	are	many	ways	to	measure	progress,	and	sometimes	it	helps	to
shift	your	focus	to	something	entirely	different.

This	is	why	nonscale	victories	can	be	effective	for	weight	loss.	The

number	on	the	scale	may	be	stubborn,	so	if	you	focus	solely	on	that
number,	your	motivation	will	sag.	But	you	may	notice	that	your	skin
looks	better	or	you	wake	up	earlier	or	your	sex	drive	got	a	boost.	All	of
these	are	valid	ways	to	track	your	improvement.	If	you’re	not	feeling
motivated	by	the	number	on	the	scale,	perhaps	it’s	time	to	focus	on	a
different	measurement—one	that	gives	you	more	signals	of	progress.

No	matter	how	you	measure	your	improvement,	habit	tracking

offers	a	simple	way	to	make	your	habits	more	satisfying.	Each
measurement	provides	a	little	bit	of	evidence	that	you’re	moving	in	the
right	direction	and	a	brief	moment	of	immediate	pleasure	for	a	job	well
done.

Chapter	Summary

One	of	the	most	satisfying	feelings	is	the	feeling	of	making
progress.

A	habit	tracker	is	a	simple	way	to	measure	whether	you	did	a
habit—like	marking	an	X	on	a	calendar.

Habit	trackers	and	other	visual	forms	of	measurement	can	make
your	habits	satisfying	by	providing	clear	evidence	of	your
progress.

Don’t	break	the	chain.	Try	to	keep	your	habit	streak	alive.

Never	miss	twice.	If	you	miss	one	day,	try	to	get	back	on	track	as
quickly	as	possible.

Just	because	you	can	measure	something	doesn’t	mean	it’s	the
most	important	thing.

How	an	Accountability	Partner	Can
Change	Everything

A

FTER	SERVING	AS	a	pilot	in	World	War	II,	Roger	Fisher	attended
Harvard	Law	School	and	spent	thirty-four	years	specializing	in

negotiation	and	conflict	management.	He	founded	the	Harvard
Negotiation	Project	and	worked	with	numerous	countries	and	world
leaders	on	peace	resolutions,	hostage	crises,	and	diplomatic
compromises.	But	it	was	in	the	1970s	and	1980s,	as	the	threat	of
nuclear	war	escalated,	that	Fisher	developed	perhaps	his	most
interesting	idea.

At	the	time,	Fisher	was	focused	on	designing	strategies	that	could
prevent	nuclear	war,	and	he	had	noticed	a	troubling	fact.	Any	sitting
president	would	have	access	to	launch	codes	that	could	kill	millions	of
people	but	would	never	actually	see	anyone	die	because	he	would
always	be	thousands	of	miles	away.

“My	suggestion	was	quite	simple,”	he	wrote	in	1981.	“Put	that
[nuclear]	code	number	in	a	little	capsule,	and	then	implant	that
capsule	right	next	to	the	heart	of	a	volunteer.	The	volunteer	would
carry	with	him	a	big,	heavy	butcher	knife	as	he	accompanied	the
President.	If	ever	the	President	wanted	to	fire	nuclear	weapons,	the
only	way	he	could	do	so	would	be	for	him	first,	with	his	own	hands,	to
kill	one	human	being.	The	President	says,	‘George,	I’m	sorry	but	tens
of	millions	must	die.’	He	has	to	look	at	someone	and	realize	what	death
is—what	an	innocent	death	is.	Blood	on	the	White	House	carpet.	It’s
reality	brought	home.

“When	I	suggested	this	to	friends	in	the	Pentagon	they	said,	‘My

God,	that’s	terrible.	Having	to	kill	someone	would	distort	the
President’s	judgment.	He	might	never	push	the	button.’”

Throughout	our	discussion	of	the	4th	Law	of	Behavior	Change	we

have	covered	the	importance	of	making	good	habits	immediately
satisfying.	Fisher’s	proposal	is	an	inversion	of	the	4th	Law:	Make	it
immediately	unsatisfying.

Just	as	we	are	more	likely	to	repeat	an	experience	when	the	ending

is	satisfying,	we	are	also	more	likely	to	avoid	an	experience	when	the
ending	is	painful.	Pain	is	an	effective	teacher.	If	a	failure	is	painful,	it
gets	fixed.	If	a	failure	is	relatively	painless,	it	gets	ignored.	The	more
immediate	and	more	costly	a	mistake	is,	the	faster	you	will	learn	from
it.	The	threat	of	a	bad	review	forces	a	plumber	to	be	good	at	his	job.
The	possibility	of	a	customer	never	returning	makes	restaurants	create
good	food.	The	cost	of	cutting	the	wrong	blood	vessel	makes	a	surgeon
master	human	anatomy	and	cut	carefully.	When	the	consequences	are
severe,	people	learn	quickly.

The	more	immediate	the	pain,	the	less	likely	the	behavior.	If	you
want	to	prevent	bad	habits	and	eliminate	unhealthy	behaviors,	then
adding	an	instant	cost	to	the	action	is	a	great	way	to	reduce	their	odds.

We	repeat	bad	habits	because	they	serve	us	in	some	way,	and	that
makes	them	hard	to	abandon.	The	best	way	I	know	to	overcome	this
predicament	is	to	increase	the	speed	of	the	punishment	associated	with
the	behavior.	There	can’t	be	a	gap	between	the	action	and	the
consequences.

As	soon	as	actions	incur	an	immediate	consequence,	behavior
begins	to	change.	Customers	pay	their	bills	on	time	when	they	are
charged	a	late	fee.	Students	show	up	to	class	when	their	grade	is	linked
to	attendance.	We’ll	jump	through	a	lot	of	hoops	to	avoid	a	little	bit	of
immediate	pain.

There	is,	of	course,	a	limit	to	this.	If	you’re	going	to	rely	on

punishment	to	change	behavior,	then	the	strength	of	the	punishment
must	match	the	relative	strength	of	the	behavior	it	is	trying	to	correct.
To	be	productive,	the	cost	of	procrastination	must	be	greater	than	the
cost	of	action.	To	be	healthy,	the	cost	of	laziness	must	be	greater	than
the	cost	of	exercise.	Getting	fined	for	smoking	in	a	restaurant	or	failing

to	recycle	adds	consequence	to	an	action.	Behavior	only	shifts	if	the
punishment	is	painful	enough	and	reliably	enforced.

In	general,	the	more	local,	tangible,	concrete,	and	immediate	the
consequence,	the	more	likely	it	is	to	influence	individual	behavior.	The
more	global,	intangible,	vague,	and	delayed	the	consequence,	the	less
likely	it	is	to	influence	individual	behavior.

Thankfully,	there	is	a	straightforward	way	to	add	an	immediate	cost

to	any	bad	habit:	create	a	habit	contract.

THE	HABIT	CONTRACT

The	first	seat	belt	law	was	passed	in	New	York	on	December	1,	1984.	At
the	time,	just	14	percent	of	people	in	the	United	States	regularly	wore	a
seat	belt—but	that	was	all	about	to	change.

Within	five	years,	over	half	of	the	nation	had	seat	belt	laws.	Today,
wearing	a	seat	belt	is	enforceable	by	law	in	forty-nine	of	the	fifty	states.
And	it’s	not	just	the	legislation,	the	number	of	people	wearing	seat
belts	has	changed	dramatically	as	well.	In	2016,	over	88	percent	of
Americans	buckled	up	each	time	they	got	in	a	car.	In	just	over	thirty
years,	there	was	a	complete	reversal	in	the	habits	of	millions	of	people.

Laws	and	regulations	are	an	example	of	how	government	can
change	our	habits	by	creating	a	social	contract.	As	a	society,	we
collectively	agree	to	abide	by	certain	rules	and	then	enforce	them	as	a
group.	Whenever	a	new	piece	of	legislation	impacts	behavior—seat	belt
laws,	banning	smoking	inside	restaurants,	mandatory	recycling—it	is
an	example	of	a	social	contract	shaping	our	habits.	The	group	agrees	to
act	in	a	certain	way,	and	if	you	don’t	follow	along,	you’ll	be	punished.

Just	as	governments	use	laws	to	hold	citizens	accountable,	you	can
create	a	habit	contract	to	hold	yourself	accountable.	A	habit	contract	is
a	verbal	or	written	agreement	in	which	you	state	your	commitment	to	a
particular	habit	and	the	punishment	that	will	occur	if	you	don’t	follow
through.	Then	you	find	one	or	two	people	to	act	as	your	accountability
partners	and	sign	off	on	the	contract	with	you.

Bryan	Harris,	an	entrepreneur	from	Nashville,	Tennessee,	was	the
first	person	I	saw	put	this	strategy	into	action.	Shortly	after	the	birth	of
his	son,	Harris	realized	he	wanted	to	shed	a	few	pounds.	He	wrote	up	a
habit	contract	between	himself,	his	wife,	and	his	personal	trainer.	The

first	version	read,	“Bryan’s	#1	objective	for	Q1	of	2017	is	to	start	eating
correctly	again	so	he	feels	better,	looks	better,	and	is	able	to	hit	his
long-term	goal	of	200	pounds	at	10%	body	fat.”

Below	that	statement,	Harris	laid	out	a	road	map	for	achieving	his

ideal	outcome:

Phase	#1:	Get	back	to	a	strict	“slow-carb”	diet	in	Q1.

Phase	#2:	Start	a	strict	macronutrient	tracking	program	in	Q2.

Phase	#3:	Refine	and	maintain	the	details	of	his	diet	and	workout
program	in	Q3.

Finally,	he	wrote	out	each	of	the	daily	habits	that	would	get	him	to
his	goal.	For	example,	“Write	down	all	food	that	he	consumes	each	day
and	weigh	himself	each	day.”

And	then	he	listed	the	punishment	if	he	failed:	“If	Bryan	doesn’t	do

these	two	items	then	the	following	consequence	will	be	enforced:	He
will	have	to	dress	up	each	workday	and	each	Sunday	morning	for	the
rest	of	the	quarter.	Dress	up	is	defined	as	not	wearing	jeans,	t-shirts,
hoodies,	or	shorts.	He	will	also	give	Joey	(his	trainer)	$200	to	use	as
he	sees	fit	if	he	misses	one	day	of	logging	food.”

At	the	bottom	of	the	page,	Harris,	his	wife,	and	his	trainer	all	signed

the	contract.

My	initial	reaction	was	that	a	contract	like	this	seemed	overly

formal	and	unnecessary,	especially	the	signatures.	But	Harris
convinced	me	that	signing	the	contract	was	an	indication	of
seriousness.	“Anytime	I	skip	this	part,”	he	said,	“I	start	slacking	almost
immediately.”

Three	months	later,	after	hitting	his	targets	for	Q1,	Harris	upgraded

his	goals.	The	consequences	escalated,	too.	If	he	missed	his
carbohydrate	and	protein	targets,	he	had	to	pay	his	trainer	$100.	And
if	he	failed	to	weigh	himself,	he	had	to	give	his	wife	$500	to	use	as	she
saw	fit.	Perhaps	most	painfully,	if	he	forgot	to	run	sprints,	he	had	to
dress	up	for	work	every	day	and	wear	an	Alabama	hat	the	rest	of	the
quarter—the	bitter	rival	of	his	beloved	Auburn	team.

The	strategy	worked.	With	his	wife	and	trainer	acting	as

accountability	partners	and	with	the	habit	contract	clarifying	exactly

what	to	do	each	day,	Harris	lost	the	weight.*

To	make	bad	habits	unsatisfying,	your	best	option	is	to	make	them
painful	in	the	moment.	Creating	a	habit	contract	is	a	straightforward
way	to	do	exactly	that.

Even	if	you	don’t	want	to	create	a	full-blown	habit	contract,	simply
having	an	accountability	partner	is	useful.	The	comedian	Margaret	Cho
writes	a	joke	or	song	every	day.	She	does	the	“song	a	day”	challenge
with	a	friend,	which	helps	them	both	stay	accountable.	Knowing	that
someone	is	watching	can	be	a	powerful	motivator.	You	are	less	likely	to
procrastinate	or	give	up	because	there	is	an	immediate	cost.	If	you
don’t	follow	through,	perhaps	they’ll	see	you	as	untrustworthy	or	lazy.
Suddenly,	you	are	not	only	failing	to	uphold	your	promises	to	yourself,
but	also	failing	to	uphold	your	promises	to	others.

You	can	even	automate	this	process.	Thomas	Frank,	an

entrepreneur	in	Boulder,	Colorado,	wakes	up	at	5:55	each	morning.
And	if	he	doesn’t,	he	has	a	tweet	automatically	scheduled	that	says,
“It’s	6:10	and	I’m	not	up	because	I’m	lazy!	Reply	to	this	for	$5	via
PayPal	(limit	5),	assuming	my	alarm	didn’t	malfunction.”

We	are	always	trying	to	present	our	best	selves	to	the	world.	We

comb	our	hair	and	brush	our	teeth	and	dress	ourselves	carefully
because	we	know	these	habits	are	likely	to	get	a	positive	reaction.	We
want	to	get	good	grades	and	graduate	from	top	schools	to	impress
potential	employers	and	mates	and	our	friends	and	family.	We	care
about	the	opinions	of	those	around	us	because	it	helps	if	others	like	us.
This	is	precisely	why	getting	an	accountability	partner	or	signing	a
habit	contract	can	work	so	well.

Chapter	Summary

The	inversion	of	the	4th	Law	of	Behavior	Change	is	make	it
unsatisfying.

We	are	less	likely	to	repeat	a	bad	habit	if	it	is	painful	or
unsatisfying.

An	accountability	partner	can	create	an	immediate	cost	to
inaction.	We	care	deeply	about	what	others	think	of	us,	and	we	do
not	want	others	to	have	a	lesser	opinion	of	us.

A	habit	contract	can	be	used	to	add	a	social	cost	to	any	behavior.
It	makes	the	costs	of	violating	your	promises	public	and	painful.

Knowing	that	someone	else	is	watching	you	can	be	a	powerful
motivator.

HOW	TO	CREATE	A	GOOD	HABIT

The	1st	Law:	Make	It	Obvious

1.1:	Fill	out	the	Habits	Scorecard.	Write	down	your	current	habits	to	become	aware	of	them.

1.2:	Use	implementation	intentions:	“I	will	[BEHAVIOR]	at	[TIME]	in	[LOCATION].”

1.3:	Use	habit	stacking:	“After	[CURRENT	HABIT],	I	will	[NEW	HABIT].”

1.4:	Design	your	environment.	Make	the	cues	of	good	habits	obvious	and	visible.

The	2nd	Law:Make	It	Attractive

2.1:	Use	temptation	bundling.	Pair	an	action	you	want	to	do	with	an	action	you	need	to	do.

2.2:	Join	a	culture	where	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal	behavior.

2.3:	Create	a	motivation	ritual.	Do	something	you	enjoy	immediately	before	a	difficult	habit.

The	3rd	Law:	Make	It	Easy

3.1:	Reduce	friction.	Decrease	the	number	of	steps	between	you	and	your	good	habits.

3.2:	Prime	the	environment.	Prepare	your	environment	to	make	future	actions	easier.

3.3:	Master	the	decisive	moment.	Optimize	the	small	choices	that	deliver	outsized	impact.

3.4:	Use	the	Two-Minute	Rule.	Downscale	your	habits	until	they	can	be	done	in	two	minutes

or	less.

3.5:	Automate	your	habits.	Invest	in	technology	and	onetime	purchases	that	lock	in	future

behavior.

The	4th	Law:	Make	It	Satisfying

4.1:	Use	reinforcement.	Give	yourself	an	immediate	reward	when	you	complete	your	habit.

4.2:	Make	“doing	nothing”	enjoyable.	When	avoiding	a	bad	habit,	design	a	way	to	see	the

benefits.

4.3:	Use	a	habit	tracker.	Keep	track	of	your	habit	streak	and	“don’t	break	the	chain.”

4.4:	Never	miss	twice.	When	you	forget	to	do	a	habit,	make	sure	you	get	back	on	track

immediately.

HOW	TO	BREAK	A	BAD	HABIT

Inversion	of	the	1st	Law:	Make	It	Invisible

1.5:	Reduce	exposure.	Remove	the	cues	of	your	bad	habits	from	your	environment.

Inversion	of	the	2nd	Law:	Make	It	Unattractive

2.4:	Reframe	your	mind-set.	Highlight	the	benefits	of	avoiding	your	bad	habits.

Inversion	of	the	3rd	Law:	Make	It	Difficult

3.6:	Increase	friction.	Increase	the	number	of	steps	between	you	and	your	bad	habits.

3.7:	Use	a	commitment	device.	Restrict	your	future	choices	to	the	ones	that	benefit	you.

Inversion	of	the	4th	Law:	Make	It	Unsatisfying

4.5:	Get	an	accountability	partner.	Ask	someone	to	watch	your	behavior.

4.6:	Create	a	habit	contract.	Make	the	costs	of	your	bad	habits	public	and	painful.

How	to	Go	from	Being	Merely	Good	to
Being	Truly	Great

18

The	Truth	About	Talent	(When	Genes
Matter	and	When	They	Don’t)

M

ANY	PEOPLE	ARE	familiar	with	Michael	Phelps,	who	is	widely
considered	to	be	one	of	the	greatest	athletes	in	history.	Phelps	has

won	more	Olympic	medals	not	only	than	any	swimmer	but	also	more
than	any	Olympian	in	any	sport.

Fewer	people	know	the	name	Hicham	El	Guerrouj,	but	he	was	a
fantastic	athlete	in	his	own	right.	El	Guerrouj	is	a	Moroccan	runner
who	holds	two	Olympic	gold	medals	and	is	one	of	the	greatest	middle-
distance	runners	of	all	time.	For	many	years,	he	held	the	world	record
in	the	mile,	1,500-meter,	and	2,000-meter	races.	At	the	Olympic
Games	in	Athens,	Greece,	in	2004,	he	won	gold	in	the	1,500-meter	and
5,000-meter	races.

These	two	athletes	are	wildly	different	in	many	ways.	(For	starters,
one	competed	on	land	and	the	other	in	water.)	But	most	notably,	they
differ	significantly	in	height.	El	Guerrouj	is	five	feet,	nine	inches	tall.
Phelps	is	six	feet,	four	inches	tall.	Despite	this	seven-inch	difference	in
height,	the	two	men	are	identical	in	one	respect:	Michael	Phelps	and
Hicham	El	Guerrouj	wear	the	same	length	inseam	on	their	pants.

How	is	this	possible?	Phelps	has	relatively	short	legs	for	his	height
and	a	very	long	torso,	the	perfect	build	for	swimming.	El	Guerrouj	has
incredibly	long	legs	and	a	short	upper	body,	an	ideal	frame	for	distance
running.

Now,	imagine	if	these	world-class	athletes	were	to	switch	sports.
Given	his	remarkable	athleticism,	could	Michael	Phelps	become	an
Olympic-caliber	distance	runner	with	enough	training?	It’s	unlikely.	At

peak	fitness,	Phelps	weighed	194	pounds,	which	is	40	percent	heavier
than	El	Guerrouj,	who	competed	at	an	ultralight	138	pounds.	Taller
runners	are	heavier	runners,	and	every	extra	pound	is	a	curse	when	it
comes	to	distance	running.	Against	elite	competition,	Phelps	would	be
doomed	from	the	start.

Similarly,	El	Guerrouj	might	be	one	of	the	best	runners	in	history,
but	it’s	doubtful	he	would	ever	qualify	for	the	Olympics	as	a	swimmer.
Since	1976,	the	average	height	of	Olympic	gold	medalists	in	the	men’s
1,500-meter	run	is	five	feet,	ten	inches.	In	comparison,	the	average
height	of	Olympic	gold	medalists	in	the	men’s	100-meter	freestyle
swim	is	six	feet,	four	inches.	Swimmers	tend	to	be	tall	and	have	long
backs	and	arms,	which	are	ideal	for	pulling	through	the	water.	El
Guerrouj	would	be	at	a	severe	disadvantage	before	he	ever	touched	the
pool.

The	secret	to	maximizing	your	odds	of	success	is	to	choose	the	right
field	of	competition.	This	is	just	as	true	with	habit	change	as	it	is	with
sports	and	business.	Habits	are	easier	to	perform,	and	more	satisfying
to	stick	with,	when	they	align	with	your	natural	inclinations	and
abilities.	Like	Michael	Phelps	in	the	pool	or	Hicham	El	Guerrouj	on	the
track,	you	want	to	play	a	game	where	the	odds	are	in	your	favor.

Embracing	this	strategy	requires	the	acceptance	of	the	simple	truth
that	people	are	born	with	different	abilities.	Some	people	don’t	like	to
discuss	this	fact.	On	the	surface,	your	genes	seem	to	be	fixed,	and	it’s
no	fun	to	talk	about	things	you	cannot	control.	Plus,	phrases	like
biological	determinism	makes	it	sound	like	certain	individuals	are
destined	for	success	and	others	doomed	to	failure.	But	this	is	a
shortsighted	view	of	the	influence	of	genes	on	behavior.

The	strength	of	genetics	is	also	their	weakness.	Genes	cannot	be
easily	changed,	which	means	they	provide	a	powerful	advantage	in
favorable	circumstances	and	a	serious	disadvantage	in	unfavorable
circumstances.	If	you	want	to	dunk	a	basketball,	being	seven	feet	tall	is
very	useful.	If	you	want	to	perform	a	gymnastics	routine,	being	seven
feet	tall	is	a	great	hindrance.	Our	environment	determines	the
suitability	of	our	genes	and	the	utility	of	our	natural	talents.	When	our
environment	changes,	so	do	the	qualities	that	determine	success.

This	is	true	not	just	for	physical	characteristics	but	for	mental	ones
as	well.	I’m	smart	if	you	ask	me	about	habits	and	human	behavior;	not

so	much	when	it	comes	to	knitting,	rocket	propulsion,	or	guitar	chords.
Competence	is	highly	dependent	on	context.

The	people	at	the	top	of	any	competitive	field	are	not	only	well
trained,	they	are	also	well	suited	to	the	task.	And	this	is	why,	if	you
want	to	be	truly	great,	selecting	the	right	place	to	focus	is	crucial.

In	short:	genes	do	not	determine	your	destiny.	They	determine	your

areas	of	opportunity.	As	physician	Gabor	Mate	notes,	“Genes	can
predispose,	but	they	don’t	predetermine.”	The	areas	where	you	are
genetically	predisposed	to	success	are	the	areas	where	habits	are	more
likely	to	be	satisfying.	The	key	is	to	direct	your	effort	toward	areas	that
both	excite	you	and	match	your	natural	skills,	to	align	your	ambition
with	your	ability.

The	obvious	question	is,	“How	do	I	figure	out	where	the	odds	are	in
my	favor?	How	do	I	identify	the	opportunities	and	habits	that	are	right
for	me?”	The	first	place	we	will	look	for	an	answer	is	by	understanding
your	personality.

HOW	YOUR	PERSONALITY	INFLUENCES	YOUR	HABITS

Your	genes	are	operating	beneath	the	surface	of	every	habit.	Indeed,
beneath	the	surface	of	every	behavior.	Genes	have	been	shown	to
influence	everything	from	the	number	of	hours	you	spend	watching
television	to	your	likelihood	to	marry	or	divorce	to	your	tendency	to	get
addicted	to	drugs,	alcohol,	or	nicotine.	There’s	a	strong	genetic
component	to	how	obedient	or	rebellious	you	are	when	facing
authority,	how	vulnerable	or	resistant	you	are	to	stressful	events,	how
proactive	or	reactive	you	tend	to	be,	and	even	how	captivated	or	bored
you	feel	during	sensory	experiences	like	attending	a	concert.	As	Robert
Plomin,	a	behavioral	geneticist	at	King’s	College	in	London,	told	me,
“It	is	now	at	the	point	where	we	have	stopped	testing	to	see	if	traits
have	a	genetic	component	because	we	literally	can’t	find	a	single	one
that	isn’t	influenced	by	our	genes.”

Bundled	together,	your	unique	cluster	of	genetic	traits	predispose

you	to	a	particular	personality.	Your	personality	is	the	set	of
characteristics	that	is	consistent	from	situation	to	situation.	The	most
proven	scientific	analysis	of	personality	traits	is	known	as	the	“Big
Five,”	which	breaks	them	down	into	five	spectrums	of	behavior.

1.	 Openness	to	experience:	from	curious	and	inventive	on	one	end

to	cautious	and	consistent	on	the	other.

2.	 Conscientiousness:	organized	and	efficient	to	easygoing	and

spontaneous.

3.	 Extroversion:	outgoing	and	energetic	to	solitary	and	reserved

(you	likely	know	them	as	extroverts	vs.	introverts).

4.	 Agreeableness:	friendly	and	compassionate	to	challenging	and

detached.

5.	 Neuroticism:	anxious	and	sensitive	to	confident,	calm,	and

stable.

All	five	characteristics	have	biological	underpinnings.	Extroversion,
for	instance,	can	be	tracked	from	birth.	If	scientists	play	a	loud	noise	in
the	nursing	ward,	some	babies	turn	toward	it	while	others	turn	away.
When	the	researchers	tracked	these	children	through	life,	they	found
that	the	babies	who	turned	toward	the	noise	were	more	likely	to	grow
up	to	be	extroverts.	Those	who	turned	away	were	more	likely	to
become	introverts.

People	who	are	high	in	agreeableness	are	kind,	considerate,	and

warm.	They	also	tend	to	have	higher	natural	oxytocin	levels,	a
hormone	that	plays	an	important	role	in	social	bonding,	increases
feelings	of	trust,	and	can	act	as	a	natural	antidepressant.	You	can	easily
imagine	how	someone	with	more	oxytocin	might	be	inclined	to	build
habits	like	writing	thank-you	notes	or	organizing	social	events.

As	a	third	example,	consider	neuroticism,	which	is	a	personality

trait	all	people	possess	to	various	degrees.	People	who	are	high	in
neuroticism	tend	to	be	anxious	and	worry	more	than	others.	This	trait
has	been	linked	to	hypersensitivity	of	the	amygdala,	the	portion	of	the
brain	responsible	for	noticing	threats.	In	other	words,	people	who	are
more	sensitive	to	negative	cues	in	their	environment	are	more	likely	to
score	high	in	neuroticism.

Our	habits	are	not	solely	determined	by	our	personalities,	but	there
is	no	doubt	that	our	genes	nudge	us	in	a	certain	direction.	Our	deeply
rooted	preferences	make	certain	behaviors	easier	for	some	people	than
for	others.	You	don’t	have	to	apologize	for	these	differences	or	feel
guilty	about	them,	but	you	do	have	to	work	with	them.	A	person	who
scores	lower	on	conscientiousness,	for	example,	will	be	less	likely	to	be

orderly	by	nature	and	may	need	to	rely	more	heavily	on	environment
design	to	stick	with	good	habits.	(As	a	reminder	for	the	less
conscientious	readers	among	us,	environment	design	is	a	strategy	we
discussed	in	Chapters	6	and	12.)

The	takeaway	is	that	you	should	build	habits	that	work	for	your
personality.*	People	can	get	ripped	working	out	like	a	bodybuilder,	but
if	you	prefer	rock	climbing	or	cycling	or	rowing,	then	shape	your
exercise	habit	around	your	interests.	If	your	friend	follows	a	low-carb
diet	but	you	find	that	low-fat	works	for	you,	then	more	power	to	you.	If
you	want	to	read	more,	don’t	be	embarrassed	if	you	prefer	steamy
romance	novels	over	nonfiction.	Read	whatever	fascinates	you.*	You
don’t	have	to	build	the	habits	everyone	tells	you	to	build.	Choose	the
habit	that	best	suits	you,	not	the	one	that	is	most	popular.

There	is	a	version	of	every	habit	that	can	bring	you	joy	and

satisfaction.	Find	it.	Habits	need	to	be	enjoyable	if	they	are	going	to
stick.	This	is	the	core	idea	behind	the	4th	Law.

Tailoring	your	habits	to	your	personality	is	a	good	start,	but	this	is

not	the	end	of	the	story.	Let’s	turn	our	attention	to	finding	and
designing	situations	where	you’re	at	a	natural	advantage.

HOW	TO	FIND	A	GAME	WHERE	THE	ODDS	ARE	IN	YOUR	FAVOR

Learning	to	play	a	game	where	the	odds	are	in	your	favor	is	critical	for
maintaining	motivation	and	feeling	successful.	In	theory,	you	can
enjoy	almost	anything.	In	practice,	you	are	more	likely	to	enjoy	the
things	that	come	easily	to	you.	People	who	are	talented	in	a	particular
area	tend	to	be	more	competent	at	that	task	and	are	then	praised	for
doing	a	good	job.	They	stay	energized	because	they	are	making
progress	where	others	have	failed,	and	because	they	get	rewarded	with
better	pay	and	bigger	opportunities,	which	not	only	makes	them
happier	but	also	propels	them	to	produce	even	higher-quality	work.	It’s
a	virtuous	cycle.

Pick	the	right	habit	and	progress	is	easy.	Pick	the	wrong	habit	and

life	is	a	struggle.

How	do	you	pick	the	right	habit?	The	first	step	is	something	we
covered	in	the	3rd	Law:	make	it	easy.	In	many	cases,	when	people	pick
the	wrong	habit,	it	simply	means	they	picked	a	habit	that	was	too

difficult.	When	a	habit	is	easy,	you	are	more	likely	to	be	successful.
When	you	are	successful,	you	are	more	likely	to	feel	satisfied.	However,
there	is	another	level	to	consider.	In	the	long-run,	if	you	continue	to
advance	and	improve,	any	area	can	become	challenging.	At	some
point,	you	need	to	make	sure	you’re	playing	the	right	game	for	your
skillset.	How	do	you	figure	that	out?

The	most	common	approach	is	trial	and	error.	Of	course,	there’s	a

problem	with	this	strategy:	life	is	short.	You	don’t	have	time	to	try
every	career,	date	every	eligible	bachelor,	or	play	every	musical
instrument.	Thankfully,	there	is	an	effective	way	to	manage	this
conundrum,	and	it	is	known	as	the	explore/exploit	trade-off.

In	the	beginning	of	a	new	activity,	there	should	be	a	period	of

exploration.	In	relationships,	it’s	called	dating.	In	college,	it’s	called	the
liberal	arts.	In	business,	it’s	called	split	testing.	The	goal	is	to	try	out
many	possibilities,	research	a	broad	range	of	ideas,	and	cast	a	wide	net.

After	this	initial	period	of	exploration,	shift	your	focus	to	the	best

solution	you’ve	found—but	keep	experimenting	occasionally.	The
proper	balance	depends	on	whether	you’re	winning	or	losing.	If	you
are	currently	winning,	you	exploit,	exploit,	exploit.	If	you	are	currently
losing,	you	continue	to	explore,	explore,	explore.

In	the	long-run	it	is	probably	most	effective	to	work	on	the	strategy

that	seems	to	deliver	the	best	results	about	80	to	90	percent	of	the
time	and	keep	exploring	with	the	remaining	10	to	20	percent.	Google
famously	asks	employees	to	spend	80	percent	of	the	workweek	on	their
official	job	and	20	percent	on	projects	of	their	choice,	which	has	led	to
the	creation	of	blockbuster	products	like	AdWords	and	Gmail.

The	optimal	approach	also	depends	on	how	much	time	you	have.	If
you	have	a	lot	of	time—like	someone	at	the	beginning	of	their	career—
it	makes	more	sense	to	explore	because	once	you	find	the	right	thing,
you	still	have	a	good	amount	of	time	to	exploit	it.	If	you’re	pressed	for
time—say,	as	you	come	up	on	the	deadline	for	a	project—you	should
implement	the	best	solution	you’ve	found	so	far	and	get	some	results.

As	you	explore	different	options,	there	are	a	series	of	questions	you
can	ask	yourself	to	continually	narrow	in	on	the	habits	and	areas	that
will	be	most	satisfying	to	you:

What	feels	like	fun	to	me,	but	work	to	others?	The	mark	of
whether	you	are	made	for	a	task	is	not	whether	you	love	it	but

whether	you	can	handle	the	pain	of	the	task	easier	than	most
people.	When	are	you	enjoying	yourself	while	other	people	are
complaining?	The	work	that	hurts	you	less	than	it	hurts	others	is
the	work	you	were	made	to	do.

What	makes	me	lose	track	of	time?	Flow	is	the	mental	state
you	enter	when	you	are	so	focused	on	the	task	at	hand	that	the
rest	of	the	world	fades	away.	This	blend	of	happiness	and	peak
performance	is	what	athletes	and	performers	experience	when
they	are	“in	the	zone.”	It	is	nearly	impossible	to	experience	a	flow
state	and	not	find	the	task	satisfying	at	least	to	some	degree.

Where	do	I	get	greater	returns	than	the	average	person?
We	are	continually	comparing	ourselves	to	those	around	us,	and	a
behavior	is	more	likely	to	be	satisfying	when	the	comparison	is	in
our	favor.	When	I	started	writing	at	jamesclear.com,	my	email	list
grew	very	quickly.	I	wasn’t	quite	sure	what	I	was	doing	well,	but	I
knew	that	results	seemed	to	be	coming	faster	for	me	than	for
some	of	my	colleagues,	which	motivated	me	to	keep	writing.

What	comes	naturally	to	me?	For	just	a	moment,	ignore	what
you	have	been	taught.	Ignore	what	society	has	told	you.	Ignore
what	others	expect	of	you.	Look	inside	yourself	and	ask,	“What
feels	natural	to	me?	When	have	I	felt	alive?	When	have	I	felt	like
the	real	me?”	No	internal	judgments	or	people-pleasing.	No
second-guessing	or	self-criticism.	Just	feelings	of	engagement	and
enjoyment.	Whenever	you	feel	authentic	and	genuine,	you	are
headed	in	the	right	direction.

To	be	honest,	some	of	this	process	is	just	luck.	Michael	Phelps	and
Hicham	El	Guerrouj	were	lucky	to	be	born	with	a	rare	set	of	abilities
that	are	highly	valued	by	society	and	to	be	placed	in	the	ideal
environment	for	those	abilities.	We	all	have	limited	time	on	this	planet,
and	the	truly	great	among	us	are	the	ones	who	not	only	work	hard	but
also	have	the	good	fortune	to	be	exposed	to	opportunities	that	favor	us.

But	what	if	you	don’t	want	to	leave	it	up	to	luck?

If	you	can’t	find	a	game	where	the	odds	are	stacked	in	your	favor,

create	one.	Scott	Adams,	the	cartoonist	behind	Dilbert,	says,
“Everyone	has	at	least	a	few	areas	in	which	they	could	be	in	the	top
25%	with	some	effort.	In	my	case,	I	can	draw	better	than	most	people,
but	I’m	hardly	an	artist.	And	I’m	not	any	funnier	than	the	average

standup	comedian	who	never	makes	it	big,	but	I’m	funnier	than	most
people.	The	magic	is	that	few	people	can	draw	well	and	write	jokes.	It’s
the	combination	of	the	two	that	makes	what	I	do	so	rare.	And	when
you	add	in	my	business	background,	suddenly	I	had	a	topic	that	few
cartoonists	could	hope	to	understand	without	living	it.”

When	you	can’t	win	by	being	better,	you	can	win	by	being	different.

By	combining	your	skills,	you	reduce	the	level	of	competition,	which
makes	it	easier	to	stand	out.	You	can	shortcut	the	need	for	a	genetic
advantage	(or	for	years	of	practice)	by	rewriting	the	rules.	A	good
player	works	hard	to	win	the	game	everyone	else	is	playing.	A	great
player	creates	a	new	game	that	favors	their	strengths	and	avoids	their
weaknesses.

In	college,	I	designed	my	own	major,	biomechanics,	which	was	a

combination	of	physics,	chemistry,	biology,	and	anatomy.	I	wasn’t
smart	enough	to	stand	out	among	the	top	physics	or	biology	majors,	so
I	created	my	own	game.	And	because	it	suited	me—I	was	only	taking
the	courses	I	was	interested	in—studying	felt	like	less	of	a	chore.	It	was
also	easier	to	avoid	the	trap	of	comparing	myself	to	everyone	else.	After
all,	nobody	else	was	taking	the	same	combination	of	classes,	so	who
could	say	if	they	were	better	or	worse?

Specialization	is	a	powerful	way	to	overcome	the	“accident”	of	bad
genetics.	The	more	you	master	a	specific	skill,	the	harder	it	becomes
for	others	to	compete	with	you.	Many	bodybuilders	are	stronger	than
the	average	arm	wrestler,	but	even	a	massive	bodybuilder	may	lose	at
arm	wrestling	because	the	arm	wrestling	champ	has	very	specific
strength.	Even	if	you’re	not	the	most	naturally	gifted,	you	can	often	win
by	being	the	best	in	a	very	narrow	category.

Boiling	water	will	soften	a	potato	but	harden	an	egg.	You	can’t
control	whether	you’re	a	potato	or	an	egg,	but	you	can	decide	to	play	a
game	where	it’s	better	to	be	hard	or	soft.	If	you	can	find	a	more
favorable	environment,	you	can	transform	the	situation	from	one
where	the	odds	are	against	you	to	one	where	they	are	in	your	favor.

HOW	TO	GET	THE	MOST	OUT	OF	YOUR	GENES

Our	genes	do	not	eliminate	the	need	for	hard	work.	They	clarify	it.
They	tell	us	what	to	work	hard	on.	Once	we	realize	our	strengths,	we
know	where	to	spend	our	time	and	energy.	We	know	which	types	of

opportunities	to	look	for	and	which	types	of	challenges	to	avoid.	The
better	we	understand	our	nature,	the	better	our	strategy	can	be.

Biological	differences	matter.	Even	so,	it’s	more	productive	to	focus

on	whether	you	are	fulfilling	your	own	potential	than	comparing
yourself	to	someone	else.	The	fact	that	you	have	a	natural	limit	to	any
specific	ability	has	nothing	to	do	with	whether	you	are	reaching	the
ceiling	of	your	capabilities.	People	get	so	caught	up	in	the	fact	that	they
have	limits	that	they	rarely	exert	the	effort	required	to	get	close	to
them.

Furthermore,	genes	can’t	make	you	successful	if	you’re	not	doing
the	work.	Yes,	it’s	possible	that	the	ripped	trainer	at	the	gym	has	better
genes,	but	if	you	haven’t	put	in	the	same	reps,	it’s	impossible	to	say	if
you	have	been	dealt	a	better	or	worse	genetic	hand.	Until	you	work	as
hard	as	those	you	admire,	don’t	explain	away	their	success	as	luck.

In	summary,	one	of	the	best	ways	to	ensure	your	habits	remain
satisfying	over	the	long-run	is	to	pick	behaviors	that	align	with	your
personality	and	skills.	Work	hard	on	the	things	that	come	easy.

Chapter	Summary

The	secret	to	maximizing	your	odds	of	success	is	to	choose	the
right	field	of	competition.

Pick	the	right	habit	and	progress	is	easy.	Pick	the	wrong	habit	and
life	is	a	struggle.

Genes	cannot	be	easily	changed,	which	means	they	provide	a
powerful	advantage	in	favorable	circumstances	and	a	serious
disadvantage	in	unfavorable	circumstances.

Habits	are	easier	when	they	align	with	your	natural	abilities.
Choose	the	habits	that	best	suit	you.

Play	a	game	that	favors	your	strengths.	If	you	can’t	find	a	game
that	favors	you,	create	one.

Genes	do	not	eliminate	the	need	for	hard	work.	They	clarify	it.
They	tell	us	what	to	work	hard	on.

The	Goldilocks	Rule:	How	to	Stay
Motivated	in	Life	and	Work

I

N	1955,	Disneyland	had	just	opened	in	Anaheim,	California,	when	a
ten-year-old	boy	walked	in	and	asked	for	a	job.	Labor	laws	were

loose	back	then	and	the	boy	managed	to	land	a	position	selling
guidebooks	for	$0.50	apiece.

Within	a	year,	he	had	transitioned	to	Disney’s	magic	shop,	where	he

learned	tricks	from	the	older	employees.	He	experimented	with	jokes
and	tried	out	simple	routines	on	visitors.	Soon	he	discovered	that	what
he	loved	was	not	performing	magic	but	performing	in	general.	He	set
his	sights	on	becoming	a	comedian.

Beginning	in	his	teenage	years,	he	started	performing	in	little	clubs
around	Los	Angeles.	The	crowds	were	small	and	his	act	was	short.	He
was	rarely	on	stage	for	more	than	five	minutes.	Most	of	the	people	in
the	crowd	were	too	busy	drinking	or	talking	with	friends	to	pay
attention.	One	night,	he	literally	delivered	his	stand-up	routine	to	an
empty	club.

It	wasn’t	glamorous	work,	but	there	was	no	doubt	he	was	getting
better.	His	first	routines	would	only	last	one	or	two	minutes.	By	high
school,	his	material	had	expanded	to	include	a	five-minute	act	and,	a
few	years	later,	a	ten-minute	show.	At	nineteen,	he	was	performing
weekly	for	twenty	minutes	at	a	time.	He	had	to	read	three	poems
during	the	show	just	to	make	the	routine	long	enough,	but	his	skills
continued	to	progress.

He	spent	another	decade	experimenting,	adjusting,	and	practicing.
He	took	a	job	as	a	television	writer	and,	gradually,	he	was	able	to	land

his	own	appearances	on	talk	shows.	By	the	mid-1970s,	he	had	worked
his	way	into	being	a	regular	guest	on	The	Tonight	Show	and	Saturday
Night	Live.

Finally,	after	nearly	fifteen	years	of	work,	the	young	man	rose	to
fame.	He	toured	sixty	cities	in	sixty-three	days.	Then	seventy-two	cities
in	eighty	days.	Then	eighty-five	cities	in	ninety	days.	He	had	18,695
people	attend	one	show	in	Ohio.	Another	45,000	tickets	were	sold	for
his	three-day	show	in	New	York.	He	catapulted	to	the	top	of	his	genre
and	became	one	of	the	most	successful	comedians	of	his	time.

His	name	is	Steve	Martin.

Martin’s	story	offers	a	fascinating	perspective	on	what	it	takes	to
stick	with	habits	for	the	long	run.	Comedy	is	not	for	the	timid.	It	is
hard	to	imagine	a	situation	that	would	strike	fear	into	the	hearts	of
more	people	than	performing	alone	on	stage	and	failing	to	get	a	single
laugh.	And	yet	Steve	Martin	faced	this	fear	every	week	for	eighteen
years.	In	his	words,	“10	years	spent	learning,	4	years	spent	refining,
and	4	years	as	a	wild	success.”

Why	is	it	that	some	people,	like	Martin,	stick	with	their	habits—
whether	practicing	jokes	or	drawing	cartoons	or	playing	guitar—while
most	of	us	struggle	to	stay	motivated?	How	do	we	design	habits	that
pull	us	in	rather	than	ones	that	fade	away?	Scientists	have	been
studying	this	question	for	many	years.	While	there	is	still	much	to
learn,	one	of	the	most	consistent	findings	is	that	the	way	to	maintain
motivation	and	achieve	peak	levels	of	desire	is	to	work	on	tasks	of	“just
manageable	difficulty.”

The	human	brain	loves	a	challenge,	but	only	if	it	is	within	an
optimal	zone	of	difficulty.	If	you	love	tennis	and	try	to	play	a	serious
match	against	a	four-year-old,	you	will	quickly	become	bored.	It’s	too
easy.	You’ll	win	every	point.	In	contrast,	if	you	play	a	professional
tennis	player	like	Roger	Federer	or	Serena	Williams,	you	will	quickly
lose	motivation	because	the	match	is	too	difficult.

Now	consider	playing	tennis	against	someone	who	is	your	equal.	As
the	game	progresses,	you	win	a	few	points	and	you	lose	a	few.	You	have
a	good	chance	of	winning,	but	only	if	you	really	try.	Your	focus
narrows,	distractions	fade	away,	and	you	find	yourself	fully	invested	in
the	task	at	hand.	This	is	a	challenge	of	just	manageable	difficulty	and	it
is	a	prime	example	of	the	Goldilocks	Rule.

The	Goldilocks	Rule	states	that	humans	experience	peak	motivation

when	working	on	tasks	that	are	right	on	the	edge	of	their	current
abilities.	Not	too	hard.	Not	too	easy.	Just	right.

THE	GOLDILOCKS	RULE

FIGURE	15:	Maximum	motivation	occurs	when	facing	a	challenge	of	just
manageable	difficulty.	In	psychology	research	this	is	known	as	the	Yerkes–
Dodson	law,	which	describes	the	optimal	level	of	arousal	as	the	midpoint
between	boredom	and	anxiety.

Martin’s	comedy	career	is	an	excellent	example	of	the	Goldilocks
Rule	in	practice.	Each	year,	he	expanded	his	comedy	routine—but	only
by	a	minute	or	two.	He	was	always	adding	new	material,	but	he	also
kept	a	few	jokes	that	were	guaranteed	to	get	laughs.	There	were	just
enough	victories	to	keep	him	motivated	and	just	enough	mistakes	to
keep	him	working	hard.

When	you’re	starting	a	new	habit,	it’s	important	to	keep	the
behavior	as	easy	as	possible	so	you	can	stick	with	it	even	when
conditions	aren’t	perfect.	This	is	an	idea	we	covered	in	detail	while
discussing	the	3rd	Law	of	Behavior	Change.

Once	a	habit	has	been	established,	however,	it’s	important	to

continue	to	advance	in	small	ways.	These	little	improvements	and	new
challenges	keep	you	engaged.	And	if	you	hit	the	Goldilocks	Zone	just
right,	you	can	achieve	a	flow	state.*

A	flow	state	is	the	experience	of	being	“in	the	zone”	and	fully

immersed	in	an	activity.	Scientists	have	tried	to	quantify	this	feeling.
They	found	that	to	achieve	a	state	of	flow,	a	task	must	be	roughly	4
percent	beyond	your	current	ability.	In	real	life	it’s	typically	not
feasible	to	quantify	the	difficulty	of	an	action	in	this	way,	but	the	core
idea	of	the	Goldilocks	Rule	remains:	working	on	challenges	of	just
manageable	difficulty—something	on	the	perimeter	of	your	ability—
seems	crucial	for	maintaining	motivation.

Improvement	requires	a	delicate	balance.	You	need	to	regularly
search	for	challenges	that	push	you	to	your	edge	while	continuing	to
make	enough	progress	to	stay	motivated.	Behaviors	need	to	remain
novel	in	order	for	them	to	stay	attractive	and	satisfying.	Without
variety,	we	get	bored.	And	boredom	is	perhaps	the	greatest	villain	on
the	quest	for	self-improvement.

HOW	TO	STAY	FOCUSED	WHEN	YOU	GET	BORED	WORKING	ON
YOUR	GOALS

After	my	baseball	career	ended,	I	was	looking	for	a	new	sport.	I	joined
a	weightlifting	team	and	one	day	an	elite	coach	visited	our	gym.	He	had
worked	with	thousands	of	athletes	during	his	long	career,	including	a
few	Olympians.	I	introduced	myself	and	we	began	talking	about	the
process	of	improvement.

“What’s	the	difference	between	the	best	athletes	and	everyone	else?”

I	asked.	“What	do	the	really	successful	people	do	that	most	don’t?”

He	mentioned	the	factors	you	might	expect:	genetics,	luck,	talent.
But	then	he	said	something	I	wasn’t	expecting:	“At	some	point	it	comes
down	to	who	can	handle	the	boredom	of	training	every	day,	doing	the
same	lifts	over	and	over	and	over.”

His	answer	surprised	me	because	it’s	a	different	way	of	thinking
about	work	ethic.	People	talk	about	getting	“amped	up”	to	work	on
their	goals.	Whether	it’s	business	or	sports	or	art,	you	hear	people	say
things	like,	“It	all	comes	down	to	passion.”	Or,	“You	have	to	really	want

it.”	As	a	result,	many	of	us	get	depressed	when	we	lose	focus	or
motivation	because	we	think	that	successful	people	have	some
bottomless	reserve	of	passion.	But	this	coach	was	saying	that	really
successful	people	feel	the	same	lack	of	motivation	as	everyone	else.	The
difference	is	that	they	still	find	a	way	to	show	up	despite	the	feelings	of
boredom.

Mastery	requires	practice.	But	the	more	you	practice	something,	the

more	boring	and	routine	it	becomes.	Once	the	beginner	gains	have
been	made	and	we	learn	what	to	expect,	our	interest	starts	to	fade.
Sometimes	it	happens	even	faster	than	that.	All	you	have	to	do	is	hit
the	gym	a	few	days	in	a	row	or	publish	a	couple	of	blog	posts	on	time
and	letting	one	day	slip	doesn’t	feel	like	much.	Things	are	going	well.
It’s	easy	to	rationalize	taking	a	day	off	because	you’re	in	a	good	place.

The	greatest	threat	to	success	is	not	failure	but	boredom.	We	get

bored	with	habits	because	they	stop	delighting	us.	The	outcome
becomes	expected.	And	as	our	habits	become	ordinary,	we	start
derailing	our	progress	to	seek	novelty.	Perhaps	this	is	why	we	get
caught	up	in	a	never-ending	cycle,	jumping	from	one	workout	to	the
next,	one	diet	to	the	next,	one	business	idea	to	the	next.	As	soon	as	we
experience	the	slightest	dip	in	motivation,	we	begin	seeking	a	new
strategy—even	if	the	old	one	was	still	working.	As	Machiavelli	noted,
“Men	desire	novelty	to	such	an	extent	that	those	who	are	doing	well
wish	for	a	change	as	much	as	those	who	are	doing	badly.”

Perhaps	this	is	why	many	of	the	most	habit-forming	products	are
those	that	provide	continuous	forms	of	novelty.	Video	games	provide
visual	novelty.	Porn	provides	sexual	novelty.	Junk	foods	provide
culinary	novelty.	Each	of	these	experiences	offer	continual	elements	of
surprise.

In	psychology,	this	is	known	as	a	variable	reward.*	Slot	machines
are	the	most	common	real-world	example.	A	gambler	hits	the	jackpot
every	now	and	then	but	not	at	any	predictable	interval.	The	pace	of
rewards	varies.	This	variance	leads	to	the	greatest	spike	of	dopamine,
enhances	memory	recall,	and	accelerates	habit	formation.

Variable	rewards	won’t	create	a	craving—that	is,	you	can’t	take	a
reward	people	are	uninterested	in,	give	it	to	them	at	a	variable	interval,
and	hope	it	will	change	their	mind—but	they	are	a	powerful	way	to
amplify	the	cravings	we	already	experience	because	they	reduce
boredom.

The	sweet	spot	of	desire	occurs	at	a	50/50	split	between	success	and

failure.	Half	of	the	time	you	get	what	you	want.	Half	of	the	time	you
don’t.	You	need	just	enough	“winning”	to	experience	satisfaction	and
just	enough	“wanting”	to	experience	desire.	This	is	one	of	the	benefits
of	following	the	Goldilocks	Rule.	If	you’re	already	interested	in	a	habit,
working	on	challenges	of	just	manageable	difficulty	is	a	good	way	to
keep	things	interesting.

Of	course,	not	all	habits	have	a	variable	reward	component,	and	you

wouldn’t	want	them	to.	If	Google	only	delivered	a	useful	search	result
some	of	the	time,	I	would	switch	to	a	competitor	pretty	quickly.	If	Uber
only	picked	up	half	of	my	trips,	I	doubt	I’d	be	using	that	service	much
longer.	And	if	I	flossed	my	teeth	each	night	and	only	sometimes	ended
up	with	a	clean	mouth,	I	think	I’d	skip	it.

Variable	rewards	or	not,	no	habit	will	stay	interesting	forever.	At
some	point,	everyone	faces	the	same	challenge	on	the	journey	of	self-
improvement:	you	have	to	fall	in	love	with	boredom.

We	all	have	goals	that	we	would	like	to	achieve	and	dreams	that	we
would	like	to	fulfill,	but	it	doesn’t	matter	what	you	are	trying	to	become
better	at,	if	you	only	do	the	work	when	it’s	convenient	or	exciting,	then
you’ll	never	be	consistent	enough	to	achieve	remarkable	results.

I	can	guarantee	that	if	you	manage	to	start	a	habit	and	keep	sticking

to	it,	there	will	be	days	when	you	feel	like	quitting.	When	you	start	a
business,	there	will	be	days	when	you	don’t	feel	like	showing	up.	When
you’re	at	the	gym,	there	will	be	sets	that	you	don’t	feel	like	finishing.
When	it’s	time	to	write,	there	will	be	days	that	you	don’t	feel	like
typing.	But	stepping	up	when	it’s	annoying	or	painful	or	draining	to	do
so,	that’s	what	makes	the	difference	between	a	professional	and	an
amateur.

Professionals	stick	to	the	schedule;	amateurs	let	life	get	in	the	way.
Professionals	know	what	is	important	to	them	and	work	toward	it	with
purpose;	amateurs	get	pulled	off	course	by	the	urgencies	of	life.

David	Cain,	an	author	and	meditation	teacher,	encourages	his

students	to	avoid	being	“fair-weather	meditators.”	Similarly,	you	don’t
want	to	be	a	fair-weather	athlete	or	a	fair-weather	writer	or	a	fair-
weather	anything.	When	a	habit	is	truly	important	to	you,	you	have	to
be	willing	to	stick	to	it	in	any	mood.	Professionals	take	action	even

when	the	mood	isn’t	right.	They	might	not	enjoy	it,	but	they	find	a	way
to	put	the	reps	in.

There	have	been	a	lot	of	sets	that	I	haven’t	felt	like	finishing,	but	I’ve

never	regretted	doing	the	workout.	There	have	been	a	lot	of	articles	I
haven’t	felt	like	writing,	but	I’ve	never	regretted	publishing	on
schedule.	There	have	been	a	lot	of	days	I’ve	felt	like	relaxing,	but	I’ve
never	regretted	showing	up	and	working	on	something	that	was
important	to	me.

The	only	way	to	become	excellent	is	to	be	endlessly	fascinated	by

doing	the	same	thing	over	and	over.	You	have	to	fall	in	love	with
boredom.

Chapter	Summary

The	Goldilocks	Rule	states	that	humans	experience	peak
motivation	when	working	on	tasks	that	are	right	on	the	edge	of
their	current	abilities.

The	greatest	threat	to	success	is	not	failure	but	boredom.

As	habits	become	routine,	they	become	less	interesting	and	less
satisfying.	We	get	bored.

Anyone	can	work	hard	when	they	feel	motivated.	It’s	the	ability	to
keep	going	when	work	isn’t	exciting	that	makes	the	difference.

Professionals	stick	to	the	schedule;	amateurs	let	life	get	in	the
way.

The	Downside	of	Creating	Good	Habits

H

ABITS	CREATE	THE	FOUNDATION	FOR	MASTERY.	In	chess,	it	is	only	after
the	basic	movements	of	the	pieces	have	become	automatic	that	a

player	can	focus	on	the	next	level	of	the	game.	Each	chunk	of
information	that	is	memorized	opens	up	the	mental	space	for	more
effortful	thinking.	This	is	true	for	any	endeavor.	When	you	know	the
simple	movements	so	well	that	you	can	perform	them	without
thinking,	you	are	free	to	pay	attention	to	more	advanced	details.	In	this
way,	habits	are	the	backbone	of	any	pursuit	of	excellence.

However,	the	benefits	of	habits	come	at	a	cost.	At	first,	each
repetition	develops	fluency,	speed,	and	skill.	But	then,	as	a	habit
becomes	automatic,	you	become	less	sensitive	to	feedback.	You	fall
into	mindless	repetition.	It	becomes	easier	to	let	mistakes	slide.	When
you	can	do	it	“good	enough”	on	autopilot,	you	stop	thinking	about	how
to	do	it	better.

The	upside	of	habits	is	that	we	can	do	things	without	thinking.	The

downside	of	habits	is	that	you	get	used	to	doing	things	a	certain	way
and	stop	paying	attention	to	little	errors.	You	assume	you’re	getting
better	because	you’re	gaining	experience.	In	reality,	you	are	merely
reinforcing	your	current	habits—not	improving	them.	In	fact,	some
research	has	shown	that	once	a	skill	has	been	mastered	there	is	usually
a	slight	decline	in	performance	over	time.

Usually,	this	minor	dip	in	performance	is	no	cause	for	worry.	You
don’t	need	a	system	to	continuously	improve	how	well	you	brush	your
teeth	or	tie	your	shoes	or	make	your	morning	cup	of	tea.	With	habits
like	these,	good	enough	is	usually	good	enough.	The	less	energy	you

spend	on	trivial	choices,	the	more	you	can	spend	it	on	what	really
matters.

However,	when	you	want	to	maximize	your	potential	and	achieve
elite	levels	of	performance,	you	need	a	more	nuanced	approach.	You
can’t	repeat	the	same	things	blindly	and	expect	to	become	exceptional.
Habits	are	necessary,	but	not	sufficient	for	mastery.	What	you	need	is	a
combination	of	automatic	habits	and	deliberate	practice.

Habits	+	Deliberate	Practice	=	Mastery

To	become	great,	certain	skills	do	need	to	become	automatic.
Basketball	players	need	to	be	able	to	dribble	without	thinking	before
they	can	move	on	to	mastering	layups	with	their	nondominant	hand.
Surgeons	need	to	repeat	the	first	incision	so	many	times	that	they
could	do	it	with	their	eyes	closed,	so	that	they	can	focus	on	the
hundreds	of	variables	that	arise	during	surgery.	But	after	one	habit	has
been	mastered,	you	have	to	return	to	the	effortful	part	of	the	work	and
begin	building	the	next	habit.

Mastery	is	the	process	of	narrowing	your	focus	to	a	tiny	element	of

success,	repeating	it	until	you	have	internalized	the	skill,	and	then
using	this	new	habit	as	the	foundation	to	advance	to	the	next	frontier
of	your	development.	Old	tasks	become	easier	the	second	time	around,
but	it	doesn’t	get	easier	overall	because	now	you’re	pouring	your
energy	into	the	next	challenge.	Each	habit	unlocks	the	next	level	of
performance.	It’s	an	endless	cycle.

MASTERING	ONE	HABIT

MASTERING	A	FIELD

FIGURE	16:	The	process	of	mastery	requires	that	you	progressively	layer
improvements	on	top	of	one	another,	each	habit	building	upon	the	last	until	a
new	level	of	performance	has	been	reached	and	a	higher	range	of	skills	has
been	internalized.

Although	habits	are	powerful,	what	you	need	is	a	way	to	remain
conscious	of	your	performance	over	time,	so	you	can	continue	to	refine
and	improve.	It	is	precisely	at	the	moment	when	you	begin	to	feel	like
you	have	mastered	a	skill—right	when	things	are	starting	to	feel

automatic	and	you	are	becoming	comfortable—that	you	must	avoid
slipping	into	the	trap	of	complacency.

The	solution?	Establish	a	system	for	reflection	and	review.

HOW	TO	REVIEW	YOUR	HABITS	AND	MAKE	ADJUSTMENTS

In	1986,	the	Los	Angeles	Lakers	had	one	of	the	most	talented
basketball	teams	ever	assembled,	but	they	are	rarely	remembered	that
way.	The	team	started	the	1985–1986	NBA	season	with	an	astounding
29–5	record.	“The	pundits	were	saying	that	we	might	be	the	best	team
in	the	history	of	basketball,”	head	coach	Pat	Riley	said	after	the	season.
Surprisingly,	the	Lakers	stumbled	in	the	1986	playoffs	and	suffered	a
season-ending	defeat	in	the	Western	Conference	Finals.	The	“best
team	in	the	history	of	basketball”	didn’t	even	play	for	the	NBA
championship.

After	that	blow,	Riley	was	tired	of	hearing	about	how	much	talent
his	players	had	and	about	how	much	promise	his	team	held.	He	didn’t
want	to	see	flashes	of	brilliance	followed	by	a	gradual	fade	in
performance.	He	wanted	the	Lakers	to	play	up	to	their	potential,	night
after	night.	In	the	summer	of	1986,	he	created	a	plan	to	do	exactly	that,
a	system	that	he	called	the	Career	Best	Effort	program	or	CBE.

“When	players	first	join	the	Lakers,”	Riley	explained,	“we	track	their

basketball	statistics	all	the	way	back	to	high	school.	I	call	this	Taking
Their	Number.	We	look	for	an	accurate	gauge	of	what	a	player	can	do,
then	build	him	into	our	plan	for	the	team,	based	on	the	notion	that	he
will	maintain	and	then	improve	upon	his	averages.”

After	determining	a	player’s	baseline	level	of	performance,	Riley
added	a	key	step.	He	asked	each	player	to	“improve	their	output	by	at
least	1	percent	over	the	course	of	the	season.	If	they	succeeded,	it
would	be	a	CBE,	or	Career	Best	Effort.”	Similar	to	the	British	Cycling
team	that	we	discussed	in	Chapter	1,	the	Lakers	sought	peak
performance	by	getting	slightly	better	each	day.

Riley	was	careful	to	point	out	that	CBE	was	not	merely	about	points
or	statistics	but	about	giving	your	“best	effort	spiritually	and	mentally
and	physically.”	Players	got	credit	for	“allowing	an	opponent	to	run
into	you	when	you	know	that	a	foul	will	be	called	against	him,	diving
for	loose	balls,	going	after	rebounds	whether	you	are	likely	to	get	them

or	not,	helping	a	teammate	when	the	player	he’s	guarding	has	surged
past	him,	and	other	‘unsung	hero’	deeds.”

As	an	example,	let’s	say	that	Magic	Johnson—the	Lakers	star	player

at	the	time—had	11	points,	8	rebounds,	12	assists,	2	steals,	and	5
turnovers	in	a	game.	Magic	also	got	credit	for	an	“unsung	hero”	deed
by	diving	after	a	loose	ball	(+1).	Finally,	he	played	a	total	of	33	minutes
in	this	imaginary	game.

The	positive	numbers	(11	+	8	+	12	+	2	+	1)	add	up	to	34.	Then,	we
subtract	the	5	turnovers	(34–5)	to	get	29.	Finally,	we	divide	29	by	33
minutes	played.

29/33	=	0.879

Magic’s	CBE	number	here	would	be	879.	This	number	was

calculated	for	all	of	a	player’s	games,	and	it	was	the	average	CBE	that	a
player	was	asked	to	improve	by	1	percent	over	the	season.	Riley
compared	each	player’s	current	CBE	to	not	only	their	past
performances	but	also	those	of	other	players	in	the	league.	As	Riley	put
it,	“We	rank	team	members	alongside	league	opponents	who	play	the
same	position	and	have	similar	role	definitions.”

Sportswriter	Jackie	MacMullan	noted,	“Riley	trumpeted	the	top
performers	in	the	league	in	bold	lettering	on	the	blackboard	each	week
and	measured	them	against	the	corresponding	players	on	his	own
roster.	Solid,	reliable	players	generally	rated	a	score	in	the	600s,	while
elite	players	scored	at	least	800.	Magic	Johnson,	who	submitted	138
triple-doubles	in	his	career,	often	scored	over	1,000.”

The	Lakers	also	emphasized	year-over-year	progress	by	making
historical	comparisons	of	CBE	data.	Riley	said,	“We	stacked	the	month
of	November	1986,	next	to	November	1985,	and	showed	the	players
whether	they	were	doing	better	or	worse	than	at	the	same	point	last
season.	Then	we	showed	them	how	their	performance	figures	for
December	1986,	stacked	up	against	November’s.”

The	Lakers	rolled	out	CBE	in	October	1986.	Eight	months	later,	they

were	NBA	champions.	The	following	year,	Pat	Riley	led	his	team	to
another	title	as	the	Lakers	became	the	first	team	in	twenty	years	to	win
back-to-back	NBA	championships.	Afterward,	he	said,	“Sustaining	an
effort	is	the	most	important	thing	for	any	enterprise.	The	way	to	be
successful	is	to	learn	how	to	do	things	right,	then	do	them	the	same
way	every	time.”

The	CBE	program	is	a	prime	example	of	the	power	of	reflection	and

review.	The	Lakers	were	already	talented.	CBE	helped	them	get	the
most	out	of	what	they	had,	and	made	sure	their	habits	improved	rather
than	declined.

Reflection	and	review	enables	the	long-term	improvement	of	all
habits	because	it	makes	you	aware	of	your	mistakes	and	helps	you
consider	possible	paths	for	improvement.	Without	reflection,	we	can
make	excuses,	create	rationalizations,	and	lie	to	ourselves.	We	have	no
process	for	determining	whether	we	are	performing	better	or	worse
compared	to	yesterday.

Top	performers	in	all	fields	engage	in	various	types	of	reflection	and

review,	and	the	process	doesn’t	have	to	be	complex.	Kenyan	runner
Eliud	Kipchoge	is	one	of	the	greatest	marathoners	of	all	time	and	an
Olympic	gold	medalist.	He	still	takes	notes	after	every	practice	in
which	he	reviews	his	training	for	the	day	and	searches	for	areas	that
can	be	improved.	Similarly,	gold	medal	swimmer	Katie	Ledecky
records	her	wellness	on	a	scale	of	1	to	10	and	includes	notes	on	her
nutrition	and	how	well	she	slept.	She	also	records	the	times	posted	by
other	swimmers.	At	the	end	of	each	week,	her	coach	goes	over	her
notes	and	adds	his	thoughts.

It’s	not	just	athletes,	either.	When	comedian	Chris	Rock	is	preparing

fresh	material,	he	will	first	appear	at	small	nightclubs	dozens	of	times
and	test	hundreds	of	jokes.	He	brings	a	notepad	on	stage	and	records
which	bits	go	over	well	and	where	he	needs	to	make	adjustments.	The
few	killer	lines	that	survive	will	form	the	backbone	of	his	new	show.

I	know	of	executives	and	investors	who	keep	a	“decision	journal”	in
which	they	record	the	major	decisions	they	make	each	week,	why	they
made	them,	and	what	they	expect	the	outcome	to	be.	They	review	their
choices	at	the	end	of	each	month	or	year	to	see	where	they	were	correct
and	where	they	went	wrong.*

Improvement	is	not	just	about	learning	habits,	it’s	also	about	fine-
tuning	them.	Reflection	and	review	ensures	that	you	spend	your	time
on	the	right	things	and	make	course	corrections	whenever	necessary—
like	Pat	Riley	adjusting	the	effort	of	his	players	on	a	nightly	basis.	You
don’t	want	to	keep	practicing	a	habit	if	it	becomes	ineffective.

Personally,	I	employ	two	primary	modes	of	reflection	and	review.
Each	December,	I	perform	an	Annual	Review,	in	which	I	reflect	on	the

previous	year.	I	tally	my	habits	for	the	year	by	counting	up	how	many
articles	I	published,	how	many	workouts	I	put	in,	how	many	new
places	I	visited,	and	more.*	Then,	I	reflect	on	my	progress	(or	lack
thereof)	by	answering	three	questions:

1.	 What	went	well	this	year?

2.	 What	didn’t	go	so	well	this	year?

3.	 What	did	I	learn?

Six	months	later,	when	summer	rolls	around,	I	conduct	an	Integrity

Report.	Like	everyone,	I	make	a	lot	of	mistakes.	My	Integrity	Report
helps	me	realize	where	I	went	wrong	and	motivates	me	to	get	back	on
course.	I	use	it	as	a	time	to	revisit	my	core	values	and	consider	whether
I	have	been	living	in	accordance	with	them.	This	is	when	I	reflect	on
my	identity	and	how	I	can	work	toward	being	the	type	of	person	I	wish
to	become.*

My	yearly	Integrity	Report	answers	three	questions:

1.	 What	are	the	core	values	that	drive	my	life	and	work?

2.	 How	am	I	living	and	working	with	integrity	right	now?

3.	 How	can	I	set	a	higher	standard	in	the	future?

These	two	reports	don’t	take	very	long—just	a	few	hours	per	year—

but	they	are	crucial	periods	of	refinement.	They	prevent	the	gradual
slide	that	happens	when	I	don’t	pay	close	attention.	They	provide	an
annual	reminder	to	revisit	my	desired	identity	and	consider	how	my
habits	are	helping	me	become	the	type	of	person	I	wish	to	be.	They
indicate	when	I	should	upgrade	my	habits	and	take	on	new	challenges
and	when	I	should	dial	my	efforts	back	and	focus	on	the	fundamentals.

Reflection	can	also	bring	a	sense	of	perspective.	Daily	habits	are
powerful	because	of	how	they	compound,	but	worrying	too	much	about
every	daily	choice	is	like	looking	at	yourself	in	the	mirror	from	an	inch
away.	You	can	see	every	imperfection	and	lose	sight	of	the	bigger
picture.	There	is	too	much	feedback.	Conversely,	never	reviewing	your
habits	is	like	never	looking	in	the	mirror.	You	aren’t	aware	of	easily
fixable	flaws—a	spot	on	your	shirt,	a	bit	of	food	in	your	teeth.	There	is

too	little	feedback.	Periodic	reflection	and	review	is	like	viewing
yourself	in	the	mirror	from	a	conversational	distance.	You	can	see	the
important	changes	you	should	make	without	losing	sight	of	the	bigger
picture.	You	want	to	view	the	entire	mountain	range,	not	obsess	over
each	peak	and	valley.

Finally,	reflection	and	review	offers	an	ideal	time	to	revisit	one	of

the	most	important	aspects	of	behavior	change:	identity.

HOW	TO	BREAK	THE	BELIEFS	THAT	HOLD	YOU	BACK

In	the	beginning,	repeating	a	habit	is	essential	to	build	up	evidence	of
your	desired	identity.	As	you	latch	on	to	that	new	identity,	however,
those	same	beliefs	can	hold	you	back	from	the	next	level	of	growth.
When	working	against	you,	your	identity	creates	a	kind	of	“pride”	that
encourages	you	to	deny	your	weak	spots	and	prevents	you	from	truly
growing.	This	is	one	of	the	greatest	downsides	of	building	habits.

The	more	sacred	an	idea	is	to	us—that	is,	the	more	deeply	it	is	tied
to	our	identity—the	more	strongly	we	will	defend	it	against	criticism.
You	see	this	in	every	industry.	The	schoolteacher	who	ignores
innovative	teaching	methods	and	sticks	with	her	tried-and-true	lesson
plans.	The	veteran	manager	who	is	committed	to	doing	things	“his
way.”	The	surgeon	who	dismisses	the	ideas	of	her	younger	colleagues.
The	band	who	produces	a	mind-blowing	first	album	and	then	gets
stuck	in	a	rut.	The	tighter	we	cling	to	an	identity,	the	harder	it	becomes
to	grow	beyond	it.

One	solution	is	to	avoid	making	any	single	aspect	of	your	identity	an

overwhelming	portion	of	who	you	are.	In	the	words	of	investor	Paul
Graham,	“keep	your	identity	small.”	The	more	you	let	a	single	belief
define	you,	the	less	capable	you	are	of	adapting	when	life	challenges
you.	If	you	tie	everything	up	in	being	the	point	guard	or	the	partner	at
the	firm	or	whatever	else,	then	the	loss	of	that	facet	of	your	life	will
wreck	you.	If	you’re	a	vegan	and	then	develop	a	health	condition	that
forces	you	to	change	your	diet,	you’ll	have	an	identity	crisis	on	your
hands.	When	you	cling	too	tightly	to	one	identity,	you	become	brittle.
Lose	that	one	thing	and	you	lose	yourself.

For	most	of	my	young	life,	being	an	athlete	was	a	major	part	of	my

identity.	After	my	baseball	career	ended,	I	struggled	to	find	myself.

When	you	spend	your	whole	life	defining	yourself	in	one	way	and	that
disappears,	who	are	you	now?

Military	veterans	and	former	entrepreneurs	report	similar	feelings.
If	your	identity	is	wrapped	up	in	a	belief	like	“I’m	a	great	soldier,”	what
happens	when	your	period	of	service	ends?	For	many	business	owners,
their	identity	is	something	along	the	lines	of	“I’m	the	CEO”	or	“I’m	the
founder.”	If	you	have	spent	every	waking	moment	working	on	your
business,	how	will	you	feel	after	you	sell	the	company?

The	key	to	mitigating	these	losses	of	identity	is	to	redefine	yourself

such	that	you	get	to	keep	important	aspects	of	your	identity	even	if
your	particular	role	changes.

“I’m	an	athlete”	becomes	“I’m	the	type	of	person	who	is	mentally
tough	and	loves	a	physical	challenge.”

“I’m	a	great	soldier”	transforms	into	“I’m	the	type	of	person	who
is	disciplined,	reliable,	and	great	on	a	team.”

“I’m	the	CEO”	translates	to	“I’m	the	type	of	person	who	builds
and	creates	things.”

When	chosen	effectively,	an	identity	can	be	flexible	rather	than

brittle.	Like	water	flowing	around	an	obstacle,	your	identity	works	with
the	changing	circumstances	rather	than	against	them.

The	following	quote	from	the	Tao	Te	Ching	encapsulates	the	ideas

perfectly:

Men	are	born	soft	and	supple;

dead,	they	are	stiff	and	hard.

Plants	are	born	tender	and	pliant;

dead,	they	are	brittle	and	dry.

Thus	whoever	is	stiff	and	inflexible

is	a	disciple	of	death.

Whoever	is	soft	and	yielding

is	a	disciple	of	life.

The	hard	and	stiff	will	be	broken.

The	soft	and	supple	will	prevail.

—LAO	TZU

Habits	deliver	numerous	benefits,	but	the	downside	is	that	they	can

lock	us	into	our	previous	patterns	of	thinking	and	acting—even	when
the	world	is	shifting	around	us.	Everything	is	impermanent.	Life	is
constantly	changing,	so	you	need	to	periodically	check	in	to	see	if	your
old	habits	and	beliefs	are	still	serving	you.

A	lack	of	self-awareness	is	poison.	Reflection	and	review	is	the

antidote.

Chapter	Summary

The	upside	of	habits	is	that	we	can	do	things	without	thinking.
The	downside	is	that	we	stop	paying	attention	to	little	errors.

Habits	+	Deliberate	Practice	=	Mastery

Reflection	and	review	is	a	process	that	allows	you	to	remain
conscious	of	your	performance	over	time.

The	tighter	we	cling	to	an	identity,	the	harder	it	becomes	to	grow
beyond	it.

Conclusion

The	Secret	to	Results	That	Last

T

HERE	IS	AN	ancient	Greek	parable	known	as	the	Sorites	Paradox,*
which	talks	about	the	effect	one	small	action	can	have	when
repeated	enough	times.	One	formulation	of	the	paradox	goes	as
follows:	Can	one	coin	make	a	person	rich?	If	you	give	a	person	a	pile	of
ten	coins,	you	wouldn’t	claim	that	he	or	she	is	rich.	But	what	if	you	add
another?	And	another?	And	another?	At	some	point,	you	will	have	to
admit	that	no	one	can	be	rich	unless	one	coin	can	make	him	or	her	so.

We	can	say	the	same	about	atomic	habits.	Can	one	tiny	change
transform	your	life?	It’s	unlikely	you	would	say	so.	But	what	if	you
made	another?	And	another?	And	another?	At	some	point,	you	will
have	to	admit	that	your	life	was	transformed	by	one	small	change.

The	holy	grail	of	habit	change	is	not	a	single	1	percent	improvement,
but	a	thousand	of	them.	It’s	a	bunch	of	atomic	habits	stacking	up,	each
one	a	fundamental	unit	of	the	overall	system.

In	the	beginning,	small	improvements	can	often	seem	meaningless
because	they	get	washed	away	by	the	weight	of	the	system.	Just	as	one
coin	won’t	make	you	rich,	one	positive	change	like	meditating	for	one
minute	or	reading	one	page	each	day	is	unlikely	to	deliver	a	noticeable
difference.

Gradually,	though,	as	you	continue	to	layer	small	changes	on	top	of
one	another,	the	scales	of	life	start	to	move.	Each	improvement	is	like
adding	a	grain	of	sand	to	the	positive	side	of	the	scale,	slowly	tilting
things	in	your	favor.	Eventually,	if	you	stick	with	it,	you	hit	a	tipping
point.	Suddenly,	it	feels	easier	to	stick	with	good	habits.	The	weight	of
the	system	is	working	for	you	rather	than	against	you.

Over	the	course	of	this	book,	we’ve	looked	at	dozens	of	stories	about

top	performers.	We’ve	heard	about	Olympic	gold	medalists,	award-
winning	artists,	business	leaders,	lifesaving	physicians,	and	star
comedians	who	have	all	used	the	science	of	small	habits	to	master	their

craft	and	vault	to	the	top	of	their	field.	Each	of	the	people,	teams,	and
companies	we	have	covered	has	faced	different	circumstances,	but
ultimately	progressed	in	the	same	way:	through	a	commitment	to	tiny,
sustainable,	unrelenting	improvements.

Success	is	not	a	goal	to	reach	or	a	finish	line	to	cross.	It	is	a	system
to	improve,	an	endless	process	to	refine.	In	Chapter	1,	I	said,	“If	you’re
having	trouble	changing	your	habits,	the	problem	isn’t	you.	The
problem	is	your	system.	Bad	habits	repeat	themselves	again	and	again
not	because	you	don’t	want	to	change,	but	because	you	have	the	wrong
system	for	change.”

As	this	book	draws	to	a	close,	I	hope	the	opposite	is	true.	With	the
Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change,	you	have	a	set	of	tools	and	strategies
that	you	can	use	to	build	better	systems	and	shape	better	habits.
Sometimes	a	habit	will	be	hard	to	remember	and	you’ll	need	to	make	it
obvious.	Other	times	you	won’t	feel	like	starting	and	you’ll	need	to
make	it	attractive.	In	many	cases,	you	may	find	that	a	habit	will	be	too
difficult	and	you’ll	need	to	make	it	easy.	And	sometimes,	you	won’t	feel
like	sticking	with	it	and	you’ll	need	to	make	it	satisfying.

Behaviors	are	effortless	here.

Behaviors	are	difficult	here.

Obvious

Attractive

Easy

Satisfying

Invisible

Unattractive

Hard

Unsatisfying

You	want	to	push	your	good	habits	toward	the	left	side	of	the	spectrum	by
making	them	obvious,	attractive,	easy,	and	satisfying.	Meanwhile,	you	want
to	cluster	your	bad	habits	toward	the	right	side	by	making	them	invisible,
unattractive,	hard,	and	unsatisfying.

This	is	a	continuous	process.	There	is	no	finish	line.	There	is	no
permanent	solution.	Whenever	you’re	looking	to	improve,	you	can
rotate	through	the	Four	Laws	of	Behavior	Change	until	you	find	the
next	bottleneck.	Make	it	obvious.	Make	it	attractive.	Make	it	easy.
Make	it	satisfying.	Round	and	round.	Always	looking	for	the	next	way
to	get	1	percent	better.

The	secret	to	getting	results	that	last	is	to	never	stop	making
improvements.	It’s	remarkable	what	you	can	build	if	you	just	don’t

stop.	It’s	remarkable	the	business	you	can	build	if	you	don’t	stop
working.	It’s	remarkable	the	body	you	can	build	if	you	don’t	stop
training.	It’s	remarkable	the	knowledge	you	can	build	if	you	don’t	stop
learning.	It’s	remarkable	the	fortune	you	can	build	if	you	don’t	stop
saving.	It’s	remarkable	the	friendships	you	can	build	if	you	don’t	stop
caring.	Small	habits	don’t	add	up.	They	compound.

That’s	the	power	of	atomic	habits.	Tiny	changes.	Remarkable

results.

Little	Lessons	from	the	Four	Laws

I

N	THIS	BOOK,	I	have	introduced	a	four-step	model	for	human	behavior:
cue,	craving,	response,	reward.	This	framework	not	only	teaches	us

how	to	create	new	habits	but	also	reveals	some	interesting	insights
about	human	behavior.

1.	Cue

2.	Craving

3.	Response

4.	Reward

Problem	phase

Solution	phase

In	this	section,	I	have	compiled	some	lessons	(and	a	few	bits	of
common	sense)	that	are	confirmed	by	the	model.	The	purpose	of	these
examples	is	to	clarify	just	how	useful	and	wide-ranging	this	framework
is	when	describing	human	behavior.	Once	you	understand	the	model,
you’ll	see	examples	of	it	everywhere.

Awareness	comes	before	desire.	A	craving	is	created	when	you
assign	meaning	to	a	cue.	Your	brain	constructs	an	emotion	or	feeling	to
describe	your	current	situation,	and	that	means	a	craving	can	only
occur	after	you	have	noticed	an	opportunity.

Happiness	is	simply	the	absence	of	desire.	When	you	observe

a	cue,	but	do	not	desire	to	change	your	state,	you	are	content	with	the
current	situation.	Happiness	is	not	about	the	achievement	of	pleasure
(which	is	joy	or	satisfaction),	but	about	the	lack	of	desire.	It	arrives
when	you	have	no	urge	to	feel	differently.	Happiness	is	the	state	you
enter	when	you	no	longer	want	to	change	your	state.

However,	happiness	is	fleeting	because	a	new	desire	always	comes

along.	As	Caed	Budris	says,	“Happiness	is	the	space	between	one

desire	being	fulfilled	and	a	new	desire	forming.”	Likewise,	suffering	is
the	space	between	craving	a	change	in	state	and	getting	it.

It	is	the	idea	of	pleasure	that	we	chase.	We	seek	the	image	of

pleasure	that	we	generate	in	our	minds.	At	the	time	of	action,	we	do
not	know	what	it	will	be	like	to	attain	that	image	(or	even	if	it	will
satisfy	us).	The	feeling	of	satisfaction	only	comes	afterward.	This	is
what	the	Austrian	neurologist	Victor	Frankl	meant	when	he	said	that
happiness	cannot	be	pursued,	it	must	ensue.	Desire	is	pursued.
Pleasure	ensues	from	action.

Peace	occurs	when	you	don’t	turn	your	observations	into
problems.	The	first	step	in	any	behavior	is	observation.	You	notice	a
cue,	a	bit	of	information,	an	event.	If	you	do	not	desire	to	act	on	what
you	observe,	then	you	are	at	peace.

Craving	is	about	wanting	to	fix	everything.	Observation	without
craving	is	the	realization	that	you	do	not	need	to	fix	anything.	Your
desires	are	not	running	rampant.	You	do	not	crave	a	change	in	state.
Your	mind	does	not	generate	a	problem	for	you	to	solve.	You’re	simply
observing	and	existing.

With	a	big	enough	why	you	can	overcome	any	how.
Friedrich	Nietzsche,	the	German	philosopher	and	poet,	famously
wrote,	“He	who	has	a	why	to	live	for	can	bear	almost	any	how.”	This
phrase	harbors	an	important	truth	about	human	behavior.	If	your
motivation	and	desire	are	great	enough	(that	is,	why	are	you	are
acting),	you’ll	take	action	even	when	it	is	quite	difficult.	Great	craving
can	power	great	action—even	when	friction	is	high.

Being	curious	is	better	than	being	smart.	Being	motivated

and	curious	counts	for	more	than	being	smart	because	it	leads	to
action.	Being	smart	will	never	deliver	results	on	its	own	because	it
doesn’t	get	you	to	act.	It	is	desire,	not	intelligence,	that	prompts
behavior.	As	Naval	Ravikant	says,	“The	trick	to	doing	anything	is	first
cultivating	a	desire	for	it.”

Emotions	drive	behavior.	Every	decision	is	an	emotional
decision	at	some	level.	Whatever	your	logical	reasons	are	for	taking
action,	you	only	feel	compelled	to	act	on	them	because	of	emotion.	In
fact,	people	with	damage	to	emotional	centers	of	the	brain	can	list
many	reasons	for	taking	action	but	still	will	not	act	because	they	do	not

have	emotions	to	drive	them.	This	is	why	craving	comes	before
response.	The	feeling	comes	first,	and	then	the	behavior.

We	can	only	be	rational	and	logical	after	we	have	been
emotional.	The	primary	mode	of	the	brain	is	to	feel;	the	secondary
mode	is	to	think.	Our	first	response—the	fast,	nonconscious	portion	of
the	brain—is	optimized	for	feeling	and	anticipating.	Our	second
response—the	slow,	conscious	portion	of	the	brain—is	the	part	that
does	the	“thinking.”

Psychologists	refer	to	this	as	System	1	(feelings	and	rapid

judgments)	versus	System	2	(rational	analysis).	The	feeling	comes	first
(System	1);	the	rationality	only	intervenes	later	(System	2).	This	works
great	when	the	two	are	aligned,	but	it	results	in	illogical	and	emotional
thinking	when	they	are	not.

Your	response	tends	to	follow	your	emotions.	Our	thoughts

and	actions	are	rooted	in	what	we	find	attractive,	not	necessarily	in
what	is	logical.	Two	people	can	notice	the	same	set	of	facts	and
respond	very	differently	because	they	run	those	facts	through	their
unique	emotional	filter.	This	is	one	reason	why	appealing	to	emotion	is
typically	more	powerful	than	appealing	to	reason.	If	a	topic	makes
someone	feel	emotional,	they	will	rarely	be	interested	in	the	data.	This
is	why	emotions	can	be	such	a	threat	to	wise	decision	making.

Put	another	way:	most	people	believe	that	the	reasonable	response

is	the	one	that	benefits	them:	the	one	that	satisfies	their	desires.	To
approach	a	situation	from	a	more	neutral	emotional	position	allows
you	to	base	your	response	on	the	data	rather	than	the	emotion.

Suffering	drives	progress.	The	source	of	all	suffering	is	the
desire	for	a	change	in	state.	This	is	also	the	source	of	all	progress.	The
desire	to	change	your	state	is	what	powers	you	to	take	action.	It	is
wanting	more	that	pushes	humanity	to	seek	improvements,	develop
new	technologies,	and	reach	for	a	higher	level.	With	craving,	we	are
dissatisfied	but	driven.	Without	craving,	we	are	satisfied	but	lack
ambition.

Your	actions	reveal	how	badly	you	want	something.	If	you

keep	saying	something	is	a	priority	but	you	never	act	on	it,	then	you
don’t	really	want	it.	It’s	time	to	have	an	honest	conversation	with
yourself.	Your	actions	reveal	your	true	motivations.

Reward	is	on	the	other	side	of	sacrifice.	Response	(sacrifice	of

energy)	always	precedes	reward	(the	collection	of	resources).	The
“runner’s	high”	only	comes	after	the	hard	run.	The	reward	only	comes
after	the	energy	is	spent.

Self-control	is	difficult	because	it	is	not	satisfying.	A	reward

is	an	outcome	that	satisfies	your	craving.	This	makes	self-control
ineffective	because	inhibiting	our	desires	does	not	usually	resolve
them.	Resisting	temptation	does	not	satisfy	your	craving;	it	just
ignores	it.	It	creates	space	for	the	craving	to	pass.	Self-control	requires
you	to	release	a	desire	rather	than	satisfy	it.

Our	expectations	determine	our	satisfaction.	The	gap

between	our	cravings	and	our	rewards	determines	how	satisfied	we	feel
after	taking	action.	If	the	mismatch	between	expectations	and
outcomes	is	positive	(surprise	and	delight),	then	we	are	more	likely	to
repeat	a	behavior	in	the	future.	If	the	mismatch	is	negative
(disappointment	and	frustration),	then	we	are	less	likely	to	do	so.

For	example,	if	you	expect	to	get	$10	and	get	$100,	you	feel	great.	If

you	expect	to	get	$100	and	get	$10,	you	feel	disappointed.	Your
expectation	changes	your	satisfaction.	An	average	experience	preceded
by	high	expectations	is	a	disappointment.	An	average	experience
preceded	by	low	expectations	is	a	delight.	When	liking	and	wanting	are
approximately	the	same,	you	feel	satisfied.

Satisfaction	=	Liking	–	Wanting

This	is	the	wisdom	behind	Seneca’s	famous	quote,	“Being	poor	is
not	having	too	little,	it	is	wanting	more.”	If	your	wants	outpace	your
likes,	you’ll	always	be	unsatisfied.	You’re	perpetually	putting	more
weight	on	the	problem	than	the	solution.

Happiness	is	relative.	When	I	first	began	sharing	my	writing
publicly	it	took	me	three	months	to	get	one	thousand	subscribers.
When	I	hit	that	milestone,	I	told	my	parents	and	my	girlfriend.	We
celebrated.	I	felt	excited	and	motivated.	A	few	years	later,	I	realized
that	one	thousand	people	were	signing	up	each	day.	And	yet	I	didn’t
even	think	to	tell	anyone.	It	felt	normal.	I	was	getting	results	ninety
times	faster	than	before	but	experiencing	little	pleasure	over	it.	It
wasn’t	until	a	few	days	later	that	I	realized	how	absurd	it	was	that	I
wasn’t	celebrating	something	that	would	have	seemed	like	a	pipe
dream	just	a	few	years	before.

The	pain	of	failure	correlates	to	the	height	of	expectation.
When	desire	is	high,	it	hurts	to	not	like	the	outcome.	Failing	to	attain
something	you	want	hurts	more	than	failing	to	attain	something	you
didn’t	think	much	about	in	the	first	place.	This	is	why	people	say,	“I
don’t	want	to	get	my	hopes	up.”

Feelings	come	both	before	and	after	the	behavior.	Before
acting,	there	is	a	feeling	that	motivates	you	to	act—the	craving.	After
acting,	there	is	a	feeling	that	teaches	you	to	repeat	the	action	in	the
future—the	reward.

Cue	>	Craving	(Feeling)	>	Response	>	Reward	(Feeling)

How	we	feel	influences	how	we	act,	and	how	we	act	influences	how

we	feel.

Desire	initiates.	Pleasure	sustains.	Wanting	and	liking	are	the

two	drivers	of	behavior.	If	it’s	not	desirable,	you	have	no	reason	to	do
it.	Desire	and	craving	are	what	initiate	a	behavior.	But	if	it’s	not
enjoyable,	you	have	no	reason	to	repeat	it.	Pleasure	and	satisfaction
are	what	sustain	a	behavior.	Feeling	motivated	gets	you	to	act.	Feeling
successful	gets	you	to	repeat.

Hope	declines	with	experience	and	is	replaced	by

acceptance.	The	first	time	an	opportunity	arises,	there	is	hope	of
what	could	be.	Your	expectation	(cravings)	is	based	solely	on	promise.
The	second	time	around,	your	expectation	is	grounded	in	reality.	You
begin	to	understand	how	the	process	works	and	your	hope	is	gradually
traded	for	a	more	accurate	prediction	and	acceptance	of	the	likely
outcome.

This	is	one	reason	why	we	continually	grasp	for	the	latest	get-rich-
quick	or	weight-loss	scheme.	New	plans	offer	hope	because	we	don’t
have	any	experiences	to	ground	our	expectations.	New	strategies	seem
more	appealing	than	old	ones	because	they	can	have	unbounded	hope.
As	Aristotle	noted,	“Youth	is	easily	deceived	because	it	is	quick	to
hope.”	Perhaps	this	can	be	revised	to	“Youth	is	easily	deceived	because
it	only	hopes.”	There	is	no	experience	to	root	the	expectation	in.	In	the
beginning,	hope	is	all	you	have.

How	to	Apply	These	Ideas	to	Business

O

VER	THE	YEARS,	I’ve	spoken	at	Fortune	500	companies	and	growing
start-ups	about	how	to	apply	the	science	of	small	habits	to	run
more	effective	businesses	and	build	better	products.	I’ve	compiled
many	of	the	most	practical	strategies	into	a	short	bonus	chapter.	I
think	you’ll	find	it	to	be	an	incredibly	useful	addition	to	the	main	ideas
mentioned	in	Atomic	Habits.

How	to	Apply	These	Ideas	to	Parenting

O

NE	OF	THE	most	common	questions	I	hear	from	readers	is
something	along	the	lines	of,	“How	can	I	get	my	kids	to	do	this
stuff?”	The	ideas	in	Atomic	Habits	are	intended	to	apply	broadly	to	all
of	human	behavior	(teenagers	are	humans,	too),	which	means	you
should	find	plenty	of	useful	strategies	in	the	main	text.	That	said,
parenting	does	face	its	own	set	of	challenges.	As	a	bonus	chapter,	I’ve
put	together	a	brief	guide	on	how	to	apply	these	ideas	specifically	to
parenting.

Acknowledgments

I

HAVE	RELIED	HEAVILY	on	others	during	the	creation	of	this	book.	Before
anyone	else,	I	must	thank	my	wife,	Kristy,	who	has	been

indispensable	throughout	this	process.	She	has	played	every	role	a
person	can	play	in	the	writing	of	a	book:	spouse,	friend,	fan,	critic,
editor,	researcher,	therapist.	It	is	no	exaggeration	to	say	this	book
would	not	be	the	same	without	her.	It	might	not	exist	at	all.	Like
everything	in	our	life,	we	did	it	together.

Second,	I	am	grateful	to	my	family,	not	only	for	their	support	and

encouragement	on	this	book	but	also	for	believing	in	me	no	matter
what	project	I	happen	to	be	working	on.	I	have	benefited	from	many
years	of	support	from	my	parents,	grandparents,	and	siblings.	In
particular,	I	want	my	mom	and	dad	to	know	that	I	love	them.	It	is	a
special	feeling	to	know	that	your	parents	are	your	greatest	fans.

Third,	to	my	assistant,	Lyndsey	Nuckols.	At	this	point,	her	job	defies

description	as	she	has	been	asked	to	do	nearly	everything	one	could
imagine	for	a	small	business.	Thankfully,	her	skills	and	talents	are
more	powerful	than	my	questionable	management	style.	Some	sections
of	this	book	are	as	much	hers	as	they	are	mine.	I	am	deeply	grateful	for
her	help.

As	for	the	content	and	writing	of	the	book,	I	have	a	long	list	of
people	to	thank.	To	start,	there	are	a	few	people	from	whom	I	have
learned	so	much	that	it	would	be	a	crime	to	not	mention	them	by
name.	Leo	Babauta,	Charles	Duhigg,	Nir	Eyal,	and	BJ	Fogg	have	each
influenced	my	thoughts	on	habits	in	meaningful	ways.	Their	work	and
ideas	can	be	found	sprinkled	throughout	this	text.	If	you	enjoyed	this
book,	I’d	encourage	you	to	read	their	writing	as	well.

At	various	stages	of	writing,	I	benefited	from	the	guidance	of	many
fine	editors.	Thanks	to	Peter	Guzzardi	for	walking	me	through	the	early
stages	of	the	writing	process	and	for	a	kick	in	the	pants	when	I	really
needed	it.	I	am	indebted	to	Blake	Atwood	and	Robin	Dellabough	for
transforming	my	ugly	and	insanely	long	first	drafts	into	a	tight,

readable	manuscript.	And	I	am	thankful	to	Anne	Barngrover	for	her
ability	to	add	a	little	class	and	poetic	style	to	my	writing.

I’d	like	to	thank	the	many	people	who	read	early	versions	of	the
manuscript,	including	Bruce	Ammons,	Darcey	Ansell,	Tim	Ballard,
Vishal	Bhardwaj,	Charlotte	Blank,	Jerome	Burt,	Sim	Campbell,	Al
Carlos,	Nicky	Case,	Julie	Chang,	Jason	Collins,	Debra	Croy,	Roger
Dooley,	Tiago	Forte,	Matt	Gartland,	Andrew	Gierer,	Randy	Giffen,	Jon
Giganti,	Adam	Gilbert,	Stephan	Guyenet,	Jeremy	Hendon,	Jane
Horvath,	Joakim	Jansson,	Josh	Kaufman,	Anne	Kavanagh,	Chris
Klaus,	Zeke	Lopez,	Cady	Macon,	Cyd	Madsen,	Kiera	McGrath,	Amy
Mitchell,	Anna	Moise,	Stacey	Morris,	Tara-Nicholle	Nelson,	Taylor
Pearson,	Max	Shank,	Trey	Shelton,	Jason	Shen,	Jacob	Zangelidis,	and
Ari	Zelmanow.	The	book	benefited	greatly	from	your	feedback.

To	the	team	at	Avery	and	Penguin	Random	House	who	made	this

book	a	reality,	thank	you.	I	owe	a	debt	of	special	thanks	to	my
publisher,	Megan	Newman,	for	her	endless	patience	as	I	continually
pushed	back	deadlines.	She	gave	me	the	space	I	needed	to	create	a
book	I	was	proud	of	and	championed	my	ideas	at	every	step.	To	Nina,
for	her	ability	to	transform	my	writing	while	still	retaining	my	original
message.	To	Lindsay,	Farin,	Casey,	and	the	rest	of	the	PRH	team	for
spreading	the	message	of	this	book	to	more	people	than	I	could	ever
reach	on	my	own.	To	Pete	Garceau,	for	designing	a	beautiful	cover	for
this	book.

And	to	my	agent,	Lisa	DiMona,	for	her	guidance	and	insight	at	every

step	of	the	publishing	process.

To	the	many	friends	and	family	members	who	asked	“How’s	the
book	going?”	and	offered	a	word	of	encouragement	when	I	inevitably
replied	“Slowly”—thank	you.	Every	author	faces	a	few	dark	moments
when	writing	a	book,	and	one	kind	word	can	be	enough	to	get	you	to
show	up	again	the	next	day.

I	am	sure	there	are	people	I	have	forgotten,	but	I	keep	an	updated
list	of	anyone	who	has	influenced	my	thinking	in	meaningful	ways	at
jamesclear.com/thanks.

And	finally,	to	you.	Life	is	short	and	you	have	shared	some	of	your

precious	time	with	me	by	reading	this	book.	Thank	you.

Notes

I

N	THIS	SECTION,	I	have	included	a	detailed	list	of	notes,	references,	and
citations	for	each	chapter	in	the	book.	I	trust	that	most	readers	will

find	this	list	to	be	sufficient.	However,	I	also	realize	that	scientific
literature	changes	over	time	and	the	references	for	this	book	may	need
to	be	updated.	Furthermore,	I	fully	expect	that	I	have	made	a	mistake
somewhere	in	this	book—either	in	attributing	an	idea	to	the	wrong
person	or	not	giving	credit	to	someone	where	it	is	due.	(If	you	believe
this	to	be	the	case,	please	email	me	at	james@jamesclear.com	so	I	can
fix	the	issue	as	soon	as	possible.)

In	addition	to	the	notes	below,	you	can	find	a	full	list	of	updated

INTRODUCTION

We	all	deal	with	setbacks:	What	about	luck,	you	might	ask?	Luck	matters,	certainly.	Habits
are	not	the	only	thing	that	influence	your	success,	but	they	are	probably	the	most
important	factor	that	is	within	your	control.	And	the	only	self-improvement	strategy
that	makes	any	sense	is	to	focus	on	what	you	can	control.

“The	whole	principle	came	from	the	idea”:	Matt	Slater,	“Olympics	Cycling:	Marginal

Gains	Underpin	Team	GB	Dominance,”	BBC,	August	8,	2012,

Just	five	years	after	Brailsford	took	over:	Technically,	the	British	riders	won	57	percent
of	the	road	and	track	cycling	medals	at	the	2008	Olympics.	Fourteen	gold	medals	were
available	in	road	and	track	cycling	events.	The	Brits	won	eight	of	them.

you’ll	end	up	thirty-seven	times	better:	Jason	Shen,	an	entrepreneur	and	writer,

received	an	early	look	at	this	book.	After	reading	this	chapter,	he	remarked:	“If	the	gains
were	linear,	you’d	predict	to	be	3.65x	better	off.	But	because	it	is	exponential,	the
improvement	is	actually	10x	greater.”	April	3,	2018.

Habits	are	the	compound	interest:	Many	people	have	noted	how	habits	multiply	over

time.	Here	are	some	of	my	favorite	articles	and	books	on	the	subject:	Leo	Babauta,	“The
Power	of	Habit	Investments,”	Zen	Habits,	January	28,	2013,
https://zenhabits.net/bank;	Morgan	Housel,	“The	Freakishly	Strong	Base,”
Collaborative	Fund,	October	31,	2017,	http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-
freakishly-strong-base;	Darren	Hardy,	The	Compound	Effect	(New	York:	Vanguard
Press,	2012).

Accomplishing	one	extra	task:	As	Sam	Altman	says,	“A	small	productivity	gain,

compounded	over	50	years,	is	worth	a	lot.”	“Productivity,”	Sam	Altman.	April	10,	2018,
http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity.

Habits	are	a	double-edged	sword:	I’d	like	to	credit	Jason	Hreha	with	originally	describing
habits	to	me	in	this	way.	Jason	Hreha	(@jhreha),	“They’re	a	double	edged	sword,”
Twitter,	February	21,	2018,	https://twitter.com/jhreha/status/966430907371433984.

The	more	tasks	you	can	handle	without	thinking:	Michael	(@mmay3r),	“The

foundation	of	productivity	is	habits.	The	more	you	do	automatically,	the	more	you’re

subsequently	freed	to	do.	This	effect	compounds,”	Twitter,	April	10,	2018,
https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/983837519274889216.

each	book	you	read	not	only	teaches:	This	idea—that	learning	new	ideas	increases	the
value	of	your	old	ideas—is	something	I	first	heard	about	from	Patrick	O’Shaughnessy,
who	writes,	“This	is	why	knowledge	compounds.	Old	stuff	that	was	a	4/10	in	value	can
become	a	10/10,	unlocked	by	another	book	in	the	future.”

Inspiration	for	this	drawing	came	from	a	tweet	titled	“Deception	of	linear	vs	exponential”	by

@MlichaelW.	May	19,	2018.
https://twitter.com/MlichaelW/status/997878086132817920.

The	seed	of	every	habit:	This	paragraph	was	inspired	by	a	quote	from	Mr.	Mircea,	an
account	on	Twitter,	who	wrote,	“each	habit	began	its	life	as	a	single	decision.”
https://twitter.com/mistermircea.

the	goal	cannot	be	what	differentiates	the	winners	from	the	losers:	Hat	tip	to

CrossFit	coach	Ben	Bergeron	for	inspiring	this	quote	during	a	conversation	I	had	with
him	on	February	28,	2017.

You	fall	to	the	level	of	your	systems:	This	line	was	inspired	by	the	following	quote	from

Archilochus:	“We	don’t	rise	to	the	level	of	our	expectations,	we	fall	to	the	level	of	our
training.”

CHAPTER	2

You	can	imagine	them	like	the	layers	of	an	onion:	Hat	tip	to	Simon	Sinek.	His	“Golden
Circle”	framework	is	similar	in	design,	but	discusses	different	topics.	For	more,	see
Simon	Sinek,	Start	with	Why:	How	Great	Leaders	Inspire	Everyone	to	Take	Action
(London:	Portfolio/Penguin,	2013),	37.

I	resolved	to	stop	chewing	my	nails:	The	quotes	used	in	this	section	are	presented	as	a
conversation	for	reading	clarity,	but	were	originally	written	by	Clark.	See:	Brian	Clark,
“The	Powerful	Psychological	Boost	that	Helps	You	Make	and	Break	Habits,”	Further,
November	14,	2017,	https://further.net/pride-habits.

Research	has	shown	that	once	a	person:	Christopher	J.	Bryan	et	al.,	“Motivating	Voter
Turnout	by	Invoking	the	Self,”	Proceedings	of	the	National	Academy	of	Sciences	108,
no.	31	(2011):	12653–12656.

There	is	internal	pressure:	Leon	Festinger,	A	Theory	of	Cognitive	Dissonance	(Stanford,

CA:	Stanford	University	Press,	1957).

Your	identity	is	literally	your	“repeated	beingness”:	Technically,	identidem	is	a	word
belonging	to	the	Late	Latin	language.	Also,	thanks	to	Tamar	Shippony,	a	reader	of
jamesclear.com,	who	originally	told	me	about	the	etymology	of	the	word	identity,	which
she	looked	up	in	the	American	Heritage	Dictionary.

We	change	bit	by	bit:	This	is	another	reason	atomic	habits	are	such	an	effective	form	of

change.	If	you	change	your	identity	too	quickly	and	become	someone	radically	different
overnight,	then	you	feel	as	if	you	lose	your	sense	of	self.	But	if	you	update	and	expand
your	identity	gradually,	you	will	find	yourself	reborn	into	someone	totally	new	and	yet

still	familiar.	Slowly—habit	by	habit,	vote	by	vote—you	become	accustomed	to	your	new
identity.	Atomic	habits	and	gradual	improvement	are	the	keys	to	identity	change
without	identity	loss.

“behaviors	followed	by	satisfying	consequences”:	This	is	an	abbreviated	version	of	the
original	quote	from	Thorndike,	which	reads:	“responses	that	produce	a	satisfying	effect
in	a	particular	situation	become	more	likely	to	occur	again	in	that	situation,	and
responses	that	produce	a	discomforting	effect	become	less	likely	to	occur	again	in	that

CHAPTER	4

The	psychologist	Gary	Klein:	I	originally	heard	about	this	story	from	Daniel	Kahneman,

but	it	was	confirmed	by	Gary	Klein	in	an	email	on	March	30,	2017.	Klein	also	covers	the
story	in	his	own	book,	which	uses	slightly	different	quotes:	Gary	A.	Klein,	Sources	of

Museum	curators	have	been	known	to	discern:	The	story	of	the	Getty	kouros,	covered
in	Malcolm	Gladwell’s	book	Blink,	is	a	famous	example.	The	sculpture,	initially	believed
to	be	from	ancient	Greece,	was	purchased	for	$10	million.	The	controversy	surrounding
the	sculpture	happened	later	when	one	expert	identified	it	as	a	forgery	upon	first	glance.

“Until	you	make	the	unconscious	conscious”:	Although	this	quote	by	Jung	is	popular,	I
had	trouble	tracking	down	the	original	source.	It’s	probably	a	paraphrase	of	this
passage:	“The	psychological	rule	says	that	when	an	inner	situation	is	not	made
conscious,	it	happens	outside,	as	fate.	That	is	to	say,	when	the	individual	remains
undivided	and	does	not	become	conscious	of	his	inner	opposite,	the	world	must	perforce
act	out	the	conflict	and	be	torn	into	opposing	halves.”	For	more,	see	C.	G.	Jung,	Aion:

his	concept	is	slightly	different,	but	I	like	the	term	and	thought	it	appropriate	to	use	in

the	term	habit	stacking,	but	in	different	contexts.

Fogg	uses	the	term	anchoring	to	describe	this	approach	because	your	old	habit	acts	as
an	“anchor”	that	keeps	the	new	one	in	place.	No	matter	what	term	you	prefer,	I	believe	it

The	importance	of	dopamine:	“The	importance	of	dopamine	was	discovered	by	accident.

In	1954,	James	Olds	and	Peter	Milner,	two	neuroscientists	at	McGill	University,	decided
to	implant	an	electrode	deep	into	the	center	of	a	rat’s	brain.	The	precise	placement	of
the	electrode	was	largely	happenstance;	at	the	time,	the	geography	of	the	mind
remained	a	mystery.	But	Olds	and	Milner	got	lucky.	They	inserted	the	needle	right	next
to	the	nucleus	accumbens	(NAcc),	a	part	of	the	brain	that	generates	pleasurable	feelings.
Whenever	you	eat	a	piece	of	chocolate	cake,	or	listen	to	a	favorite	pop	song,	or	watch
your	favorite	team	win	the	World	Series,	it	is	your	NAcc	that	helps	you	feel	so	happy.
But	Olds	and	Milner	quickly	discovered	that	too	much	pleasure	can	be	fatal.	They	placed
the	electrodes	in	several	rodents’	brains	and	then	ran	a	small	current	into	each	wire,

making	the	NAccs	continually	excited.	The	scientists	noticed	that	the	rodents	lost
interest	in	everything.	They	stopped	eating	and	drinking.	All	courtship	behavior	ceased.
The	rats	would	just	huddle	in	the	corners	of	their	cages,	transfixed	by	their	bliss.	Within
days,	all	of	the	animals	had	perished.	They	died	of	thirst.	For	more,	see	Jonah	Lehrer,

CHAPTER	11

In	the	end,	they	had	little	to	show	for	their	efforts:	This	story	comes	from	page	29	of
Art	&	Fear	by	David	Bayles	and	Ted	Orland.	In	an	email	conversation	with	Orland	on
October	18,	2016,	he	explained	the	origins	of	the	story.	“Yes,	the	‘ceramics	story’	in	‘Art

&	Fear’	is	indeed	true,	allowing	for	some	literary	license	in	the	retelling.	Its	real-world
origin	was	as	a	gambit	employed	by	photographer	Jerry	Uelsmann	to	motivate	his
Beginning	Photography	students	at	the	University	of	Florida.	As	retold	in	‘Art	&	Fear’	it
faithfully	captures	the	scene	as	Jerry	told	it	to	me—except	I	replaced	photography	with
ceramics	as	the	medium	being	explored.	Admittedly,	it	would’ve	been	easier	to	retain
photography	as	the	art	medium	being	discussed,	but	David	Bayles	(co-author)	&	I	are
both	photographers	ourselves,	and	at	the	time	we	were	consciously	trying	to	broaden
the	range	of	media	being	referenced	in	the	text.	The	intriguing	thing	to	me	is	that	it
hardly	matters	what	art	form	was	invoked—the	moral	of	the	story	appears	to	hold
equally	true	straight	across	the	whole	art	spectrum	(and	even	outside	the	arts,	for	that
matter).”	Later	in	that	same	email,	Orland	said,	“You	have	our	permission	to	reprint	any
or	all	of	the	‘ceramics’	passage	in	your	forthcoming	book.”	In	the	end,	I	settled	on
publishing	an	adapted	version,	which	combines	their	telling	of	the	ceramics	story	with
facts	from	the	original	source	of	Uelsmann’s	photography	students.	David	Bayles	and

by	the	brain,	there	was	a	persistent	effect	that	lasted	afterward	that	made	it	easier	for
those	signals	to	be	transmitted	in	the	future.

Genes	have	been	shown	to	influence	everything:	“All	traits	are	heritable”	is	a	bit	of	an
exaggeration,	but	not	by	much.	Concrete	behavioral	traits	that	patently	depend	on
content	provided	by	the	home	or	culture	are,	of	course,	not	heritable	at	all;	which
language	you	speak,	which	religion	you	worship	in,	which	political	party	you	belong	to.
But	behavioral	traits	that	reflect	the	underlying	talents	and	temperaments	are	heritable:
how	proficient	with	language	you	are,	how	religious,	how	liberal	or	conservative.
General	intelligence	is	heritable,	and	so	are	the	five	major	ways	in	which	personality	can
vary	.	.	.	openness	to	experience,	conscientiousness,	extroversion-introversion,
antagonism-agreeableness,	and	neuroticism.	And	traits	that	are	surprisingly	specific

CONCLUSION

No	one	can	be	rich	unless	one	coin	can	make	him	or	her	so:	Desiderius	Erasmus	and

Van	Loon	Hendrik	Willem,	The	Praise	of	Folly	(New	York:	Black,	1942),	31.	Hat	tip	to
Gretchen	Rubin.	I	first	read	about	this	parable	in	her	book,	Better	Than	Before,	and
then	tracked	down	the	origin	story.	For	more,	see	Gretchen	Rubin,	Better	Than	Before
(New	York:	Hodder,	2016).

LITTLE	LESSONS	FROM	THE	FOUR	LAWS

“Happiness	is	the	space	between	one	desire”:	Caed	(@caedbudris),	“Happiness	is	the
space	between	desire	being	fulfilled	and	a	new	desire	forming,”	Twitter,	November	10,
2017,	https://twitter.com/caedbudris/status/929042389930594304.

happiness	cannot	be	pursued,	it	must	ensue:	Frankl’s	full	quotation	is	as	follows:

“Don’t	aim	at	success.	The	more	you	aim	at	it	and	make	it	a	target,	the	more	you	are
going	to	miss	it.	For	success,	like	happiness,	cannot	be	pursued;	it	must	ensue,	and	it
only	does	so	as	the	unintended	side	effect	of	one’s	personal	dedication	to	a	cause	greater
than	oneself	or	as	the	by-product	of	one’s	surrender	to	a	person	other	than	oneself.”	For
more,	see	Viktor	E.	Frankl,	Man’s	Search	for	Meaning:	An	Introduction	to
Logotherapy	(Boston:	Beacon	Press,	1962).

“He	who	has	a	why	to	live	for	can	bear	almost	any	how”:	Friedrich	Nietzsche	and

Oscar	Levy,	The	Twilight	of	the	Idols	(Edinburgh:	Foulis,	1909).

The	feeling	comes	first	(System	1):	Daniel	Kahneman,	Thinking,	Fast	and	Slow	(New

York:	Farrar,	Straus	and	Giroux,	2015).

appealing	to	emotion	is	typically	more	powerful	than	appealing	to	reason:	“If	you
wish	to	persuade,	appeal	to	interest,	rather	than	reason”	(Benjamin	Franklin).

Satisfaction	=	Liking	−	Wanting:	This	is	similar	to	David	Meister’s	fifth	law	of	service

businesses:	Satisfaction	=	perception	−	expectation.

“Being	poor	is	not	having	too	little,	it	is	wanting	more”:	Lucius	Annaeus	Seneca	and

Anna	Lydia	Motto,	Moral	Epistles	(Chico,	CA:	Scholars	Press,	1985).

As	Aristotle	noted:	It	is	debated	whether	Aristotle	actually	said	this.	The	quote	has	been

attributed	to	him	for	centuries,	but	I	could	find	no	primary	source	for	the	phrase.

*	Interested	readers	can	learn	more	at	habitsacademy.com.

*	As	this	book	was	going	to	print,	new	information	about	the
British	Cycling	team	has	come	out.	You	can	see	my	thoughts
at	atomichabits.com/cycling.

*	I	geeked	out	and	actually	calculated	this.	Washington,	D.C.,
is	about	225	miles	from	New	York	City.	Assuming	you	are
flying	on	a	747	or	an	Airbus	A380,	changing	the	heading	by
3.5	degrees	as	you	leave	Los	Angeles	likely	causes	the	nose	of
the	airplane	to	shift	between	7.2	to	7.6	feet,	or	about	86	to	92
inches.	A	very	small	shift	in	direction	can	lead	to	a	very
meaningful	change	in	destination.

*	The	terms	unconscious,	nonconscious,	and	subconscious
can	all	be	used	to	describe	the	absence	of	awareness	or
thought.	Even	in	academic	circles,	these	words	are	often	used
interchangeably	without	much	nitpicking	(for	once).
Nonconscious	is	the	term	I’m	going	to	use	because	it	is	broad
enough	to	encompass	both	the	processes	of	the	mind	we
could	never	consciously	access	and	the	moments	when	we	are
simply	not	paying	attention	to	what	surrounds	us.
Nonconscious	is	a	description	of	anything	you	are	not
consciously	thinking	about.

*	Certainly,	there	are	some	aspects	of	your	identity	that	tend
to	remain	unchanged	over	time—like	identifying	as	someone
who	is	tall	or	short.	But	even	for	more	fixed	qualities	and
characteristics,	whether	you	view	them	in	a	positive	or
negative	light	is	determined	by	your	experiences	throughout
life.

*	Readers	of	The	Power	of	Habit	by	Charles	Duhigg	will
recognize	these	terms.	Duhigg	wrote	a	great	book	and	my
intention	is	to	pick	up	where	he	left	off	by	integrating	these
stages	into	four	simple	laws	you	can	apply	to	build	better
habits	in	life	and	work.

*	Charles	Duhigg	and	Nir	Eyal	deserve	special	recognition	for
their	influence	on	this	image.	This	representation	of	the	habit
loop	is	a	combination	of	language	that	was	popularized	by
Duhigg’s	book,	The	Power	of	Habit,	and	a	design	that	was
popularized	by	Eyal’s	book,	Hooked.

*	When	I	visited	Japan,	I	saw	this	strategy	save	a	woman’s
life.	Her	young	son	stepped	onto	the	Shinkansen,	one	of
Japan’s	famous	bullet	trains	that	travel	at	over	two	hundred
miles	per	hour,	just	as	the	doors	were	closing.	She	was	left
outside	on	the	platform	and	jammed	her	arm	through	the
door	to	grab	him.	With	her	arm	stuck	in	the	door,	the	train
was	about	to	take	off,	but	right	before	it	pulled	away	an
employee	performed	a	safety	check	by	Pointing-and-Calling
up	and	down	the	platform.	In	less	than	five	seconds,	he
noticed	the	woman	and	managed	to	stop	the	train	from
leaving.	The	door	opened,	the	woman—now	in	tears—ran	to
her	son,	and	a	minute	later	the	train	departed	safely.

Habits	Scorecard	at	atomichabits.com/scorecard.

*	In	addition	to	her	payment	for	the	library,	Catherine	the
Great	asked	Diderot	to	keep	the	books	until	she	needed	them
and	offered	to	pay	him	a	yearly	salary	to	act	as	her	librarian.

*	Fogg	refers	to	this	strategy	as	the	“Tiny	Habits	recipe,”	but
I’ll	call	it	the	habit	stacking	formula	throughout	the	book.

*	If	you’re	looking	for	more	examples	and	guidance,	you	can
download	a	Habit	Stacking	template	at
atomichabits.com/habitstacking.

*	Dopamine	is	not	the	only	chemical	that	influences	your
habits.	Every	behavior	involves	multiple	brain	regions	and
neurochemicals,	and	anyone	who	claims	that	“habits	are	all
about	dopamine”	is	skipping	over	major	portions	of	the
process.	It	is	just	one	of	the	important	role	players	in	habit
formation.	However,	I	will	single	out	the	dopamine	circuit	in
this	chapter	because	it	provides	a	window	into	the	biological
underpinnings	of	desire,	craving,	and	motivation	that	are
behind	every	habit.

*	I’m	so	happy	I	was	able	to	fit	a	Game	of	Thrones	reference
into	this	book.

*	This	is	just	a	partial	list	of	underlying	motives.	I	offer	a
more	complete	list	and	more	examples	of	how	to	apply	them
to	business	at	atomichabits.com/business.

*	A	similar	story	is	told	in	the	book	Art	&	Fear	by	David
Bayles	and	Ted	Orland.	It	has	been	adapted	here	with
permission.	See	the	endnotes	for	a	full	explanation.

*	This	is	a	foundational	principle	in	physics,	where	it	is
known	as	the	Principle	of	Least	Action.	It	states	that	the	path
followed	between	any	two	points	will	always	be	the	path
requiring	the	least	energy.	This	simple	principle	underpins
the	laws	of	the	universe.	From	this	one	idea,	you	can	describe
the	laws	of	motion	and	relativity.

*	The	phrase	addition	by	subtraction	is	also	used	by	teams
and	businesses	to	describe	removing	people	from	a	group	in
order	to	make	the	team	stronger	overall.

*	To	be	fair,	this	still	sounds	like	an	amazing	night.

*	I	designed	a	habit	journal	specifically	to	make	journaling
easier.	It	includes	a	“One	Line	Per	Day”	section	where	you
simply	write	one	sentence	about	your	day.	You	can	learn
more	at	atomichabits.com/journal.

*	The	irony	of	how	closely	this	story	matches	my	process	of
writing	this	book	is	not	lost	on	me.	Although	my	publisher
was	much	more	accommodating,	and	my	closet	remained
full,	I	did	feel	like	I	had	to	place	myself	on	house	arrest	to
finish	the	manuscript.

*	This	is	also	referred	to	as	a	“Ulysses	pact”	or	a	“Ulysses
contract.”	Named	after	Ulysses,	the	hero	of	The	Odyssey,	who
told	his	sailors	to	tie	him	to	the	mast	of	the	ship	so	that	he
could	hear	the	enchanting	song	of	the	Sirens	but	wouldn’t	be
able	to	steer	the	ship	toward	them	and	crash	on	the	rocks.
Ulysses	realized	the	benefits	of	locking	in	your	future	actions
while	your	mind	is	in	the	right	place	rather	than	waiting	to
see	where	your	desires	take	you	in	the	moment.

*	The	shift	to	a	delayed-return	environment	likely	began
around	the	advent	of	agriculture	ten	thousand	years	ago
when	farmers	began	planting	crops	in	anticipation	of	a
harvest	months	later.	However,	it	was	not	until	recent
centuries	that	our	lives	became	filled	with	delayed-return
choices:	career	planning,	retirement	planning,	vacation
planning,	and	everything	else	that	occupies	our	calendars.

*	Time	inconsistency	is	also	referred	to	as	hyperbolic
discounting.

*	This	can	derail	our	decision	making	as	well.	The	brain
overestimates	the	danger	of	anything	that	seems	like	an
immediate	threat	but	has	almost	no	likelihood	of	actually
occurring:	your	plane	crashing	during	a	bit	of	turbulence,	a
burglar	breaking	in	while	you’re	home	alone,	a	terrorist
blowing	up	the	bus	you’re	on.	Meanwhile,	it	underestimates
what	appears	to	be	a	distant	threat	but	is	actually	very	likely:
the	steady	accumulation	of	fat	from	eating	unhealthy	food,
the	gradual	decay	of	your	muscles	from	sitting	at	a	desk,	the
slow	creep	of	clutter	when	you	fail	to	tidy	up.

atomichabits.com/tracker.

*	You	can	see	the	actual	Habit	Contracts	used	by	Bryan
Harris	and	get	a	blank	template	at

*	If	it’s	Harry	Potter	on	repeat,	I	feel	you.

*	I	have	a	pet	theory	about	what	happens	when	we	achieve	a
flow	state.	This	isn’t	confirmed.	It’s	just	my	guess.
Psychologists	commonly	refer	to	the	brain	as	operating	in	two
modes:	System	1	and	System	2.	System	1	is	fast	and
instinctual.	Generally	speaking,	processes	you	can	perform
very	quickly	(like	habits)	are	governed	by	System	1.
Meanwhile,	System	2	controls	thinking	processes	that	are
more	effortful	and	slow—like	calculating	the	answer	to	a
difficult	math	problem.	With	regard	to	flow,	I	like	to	imagine
System	1	and	System	2	as	residing	on	opposite	ends	of	the
spectrum	of	thinking.	The	more	automatic	a	cognitive	process
is,	the	more	it	slides	toward	the	System	1	side	of	the
spectrum.	The	more	effortful	a	task	is,	the	more	it	slides
toward	System	2.	Flow,	I	believe,	resides	on	the	razor’s	edge
between	System	1	and	System	2.	You	are	fully	using	all	of
your	automatic	and	implicit	knowledge	related	to	the	task
while	also	working	hard	to	rise	to	a	challenge	beyond	your
ability.	Both	brain	modes	are	fully	engaged.	The	conscious
and	nonconscious	are	working	perfectly	in	sync.

*	The	discovery	of	variable	rewards	happened	by	accident.
One	day	in	the	lab,	the	famous	Harvard	psychologist	B.	F.
Skinner	was	running	low	on	food	pellets	during	one
experiment	and	making	more	was	a	time-consuming	process
because	he	had	to	manually	press	the	pellets	in	a	machine.
This	situation	led	him	to	“ask	myself	why	every	press	of	the
lever	had	to	be	reinforced.”	He	decided	to	only	give	treats	to
the	rats	intermittently	and,	to	his	surprise,	varying	the
delivery	of	food	did	not	decrease	behavior,	but	actually
increased	it.

Preface 
THIS book is primarily designed to be a sequel to my book Transnational Analysis in 
Psychotherapy,1 but has been planned so that it can be read and understood independently. The 
theory necessary for the analysis and clear understanding of games has been summarized in Part I. 
Part II contains descriptions of the individual games. Part III contains new clinical and theoretical 
material which, added to the old, makes it possible to understand to some extent what it means to 
be game-free. Those desiring further background are referred to the earlier volume. The reader of 
both will note that in addition to the theoretical advances, there have been some minor changes in 
terminology and viewpoint based on further thinking and reading and new clinical material. 
The need for this book was indicated by interested requests from students and lecture audiences for 
lists of games, or for further elaboration of games mentioned briefly as examples in a general 
exposition of the principles of transactional analysis. Thanks are due in general to these students 
and audiences, and especially to the many patients who exposed to view, spotted or named new 
games; and in particular to Miss Barbara Rosenfeld for her many ideas about the art and meaning 
of listening; and to Mr. Melvin Boyce, Mr. Joseph Concannon, Dr. Franklin Ernst, Dr. Kenneth 
Everts, Dr. Gordon Gritter, Mrs. Frances Matson, and Dr. Ray Poindexter, among others, for their 
independent discovery or confirmation of the significance of many games. 
Mr. Claude Steiner, formerly Research Director of the San Francisco Social Psychiatry Seminars 
and presently in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan deserves special 
mention on two counts. He conducted the first experiments which confirmed many of the 
theoretical points at issue here, and as a result of these experiments he helped considerably in 
clarifying the nature of autonomy and of intimacy. Thanks are also due to Miss Viola Lilt, the 
Secretary-Treasurer of the Seminars, and to Mrs. Mary N. Williams, my personal secretary, for 
their continued help, and to Anne Garrett for her assistance in reading the proof. 

SEMANTICS 
For conciseness, the games are described primarily from the male point of view unless they are 
clearly feminine. Thus the chief player is usually designated as ""he,"" but without prejudice, since 
the same situation, unless otherwise indicated, could as easily be outlined with ""she,"" mutatis 
mutandis. If the woman's role differs significantly from the man's, it is treated separately. The 
therapist is similarly without prejudice designated as ""he."" The vocabulary and viewpoint are 
primarily oriented toward the practicing clinician, but members of other professions may find this 
book interesting or useful. 
Transactional game analysis should be clearly distinguished from its growing sister science of 
mathematical game analysis, although a few of the terms used in the text, such as ""payoff,"" are now 
respectably mathematical. For a detailed review of the mathematical theory of games see Games & 
Decisions, by R. D. Luce and H. Raiffa

Introduction 

1 SOCIAL INTERCOURSE 
THE theory of social intercourse, which has been outlined at some length in Transnational Analysis 
may be summarized as follows. 
Spitz has found that infants deprived of handling over a long period will tend at length to sink into 
an irreversible decline and are prone to succumb eventually to intercurrent disease. In effect, this 
means that what he calls emotional deprivation can have a fatal outcome. These observations give 
rise to the idea of stimulus-hunger, and indicate that the most favored forms of stimuli are those 
provided by physical intimacy, a conclusion not hard to accept on the basis of everyday experience. 
An allied phenomenon is seen in grown-ups subjected to sensory deprivation. Experimentally, such 
deprivation may call forth a transient psychosis, or at least give rise to temporary mental 
disturbances. In the past, social and sensory deprivation is noted to have had similar effects in 
individuals condemned to long periods of solitary imprisonment. Indeed, solitary confinement is 
one of the punishments most dreaded even by prisoners hardened to physical brutality, and is now a 
notorious procedure for inducing political compliance. (Conversely, the best of the known weapons 
against compliance is social organization.) 
On that biological side, it is probable that emotional and sensory deprivation tends to bring about or 
encourage organic changes. If the reticular activating system8 of the brain stem is not sufficiently 
stimulated, degenerative changes in the nerve cells may follow, at least indirectly. This may be a 
secondary effect due to poor nutrition, but the poor nutrition itself may be a product of apathy, as in 
infants suffering from marasmus. Hence a biological chain may he postulated leading from 
emotional and sensory deprivation through apathy to degenerative changes and death. In this sense, 
stimulus-hunger has the same relationship to survival of the human organism as food-hunger. 
Indeed, not only biologically but also psychologically and socially, stimulus-hunger in many ways 
parallels the hunger for food. Such terms as malnutrition, satiation, gourmet, gourmand, faddist, 
ascetic, culinary arts, and good cook are easily transferred from the field of nutrition to the field of 
sensation. Overstuffing has its parallel in overstimulation. In both spheres, under ordinary 
conditions where ample supplies are available and a diversified menu is possible, choices will be 
heavily influenced by an individual's idiosyncrasies. It is possible that some or many of these 
idiosyncrasies are constitutionally determined, but this is irrelevant to the problems at issue here. 
The social psychiatrist's concern in the matter is with what happens after the infant is separated 
from his mother. in the normal course of growth. What has been said so far may be summarized by 
the ""colloquialism"":7 ""If you are not stroked, your spinal cord will shrivel up."" Hence, after the 
period of close intimacy with the mother is over, the individual for the rest of his life is confronted 
with a dilemma upon whose horns his destiny and survival are continually being tossed. One born 
is the social, psychological and biological forces which stand in the way of continued physical 
intimacy in the infant style; the other is his perpetual striving for its attainment. Under most 
conditions he will compromise. He learns to do with more subtle, even symbolic, forms of handling, 
until the merest nod of recognition may serve the purpose to some extent, although his original 
craving for physical contact may remain unabated. 
This process of compromise may be called by various terms, such as sublimation; but whatever it is 
called, the result is a partial transformation of the infantile stimulus-hunger into something which 
may be termed recognition-hunger. As the complexities of compromise increase, each person 
becomes more and more individual in his quest for recognition, and it is these differentia which 
lend variety to social intercourse and which determine the individual's destiny. A movie actor may 
require hundreds of strokes each week from anonymous and undifferentiated admirers to keep his 
spinal cord from shriveling, while a scientist may keep physically and mentally healthy on one 
stroke a year from a respected master. 
""Stroking"" may be used as a general term for intimate physical contact; in practice it may take 
various forms. Some people literally stroke an infant; others hug or pat it, while some people pinch 

4

 
it playfully or flip it with a fingertip. These all have their analogues in conversation, so that it seems 
one might predict how an individual would handle a baby by listening to him talk. By an extension 
of meaning, ""stroking"" may be employed colloquially to denote any act implying recognition of 
another's presence. Hence a stroke may be used as the fundamental unit of social action. An 
exchange of strokes constitutes a transaction, which is the unit of social intercourse. 
As far as the theory of games is concerned, the principle which emerges here is that any social 
intercourse whatever has a biological advantage over no intercourse at all. This has been 
experimentally demonstrated in the case of rats through some remarkable experiments by S. Levine 
8 in which not only physical, mental and emotional development but also the biochemistry of the 
brain and even resistance to leukemia were favorably affected by handling. The significant feature 
of these experiments was that gentle handling and painful electric shocks were equally effective in 
promoting the health of the animals. 
This validation of what has been said above encourages us to proceed with increased confidence to 
the next section. 

2 THE STRUCTURING OF TIME  
Granted that handling of infants, and its symbolic equivalent in grown-ups, recognition, have a 
survival value. The question is, What next? In everyday terms, what can people do after they have 
exchanged greetings, whether the greeting consists of a collegiate ""Hi!"" or an Oriental ritual lasting 
several hours? After stimulus-hunger and recognition-hunger comes structure-hunger. The 
perennial problem of adolescents is: ""What do you say to her (him) then?"" And to many people 
besides adolescents, nothing is more uncomfortable than a social hiatus, a period of silent, 
unstructured time when no one present can think of anything more interesting to say than; ""Don't 
you think the walls are perpendicular tonight?"" The eternal problem of the human being is how to 
structure his waking hours. In this existential sense, the function of all social living is to lend 
mutual assistance for this project. 
The operational aspect of time-structuring may be called programming. In has three aspects: 
material, social and individual. The most common, convenient, comfortable, and utilitarian method 
of structuring time is by a project designed to deal with the material of external reality: what is 
commonly known as work. Such a project is technically called an activity; the term ""work"" is 
unsuitable because a general theory of social psychiatry must recognize that social intercourse is 
also a form of work. 
Material programming arises from the vicissitudes encountered in dealing with external reality; it is 
of interest here only insofar as activities offer a matrix for ""stroking,"" recognition, and other more 
complex forms of social intercourse. Material programming is not primarily a social problem; in 
essence it is based on data processing. The activity of building a boat relies on a long series of 
measurements and probability estimates, and any social exchange which occurs must be 
subordinated to these in order for the building to proceed. 
Social programming results in traditional ritualistic or semi-ritualistic interchanges. The chief 
criterion for it is local acceptability, popularity called ""good manners."" Parents in all parts of the 
world teach their children manners, which means that they know the proper greeting, eating,  
courting and mourning rituals, and also how to carry on topical conversations with appropriate 
strictures and reinforcements. The strictures and reinforcements constitute tact or diplomacy, some 
of which is universal and some local. Belching at meals or asking after another man's wife are each 
encouraged or forbidden by local ancestral tradition, and indeed there is a high degree of inverse 
correlation between these particular transactions. Usually in localities where people belch at meals, 
it is unwise to ask after the womenfolk; and in localities where people are asking after the 
womenfolk, it is unwise to belch at meals. Usually formal rituals precede semi-ritualistic topical 
conversations, and the latter may be distinguished by calling them -pastimes. 
As people become better acquainted, more and more individual programming creeps in, so that 
""incidents"" begin to occur. These incidents superficially appear to be adventitious, and may be so 
described by the parties concerned, but careful scrutiny reveals that they tend to follow definite 

5

 
patterns which are amenable to sorting and classification, and that the sequence is circumscribed by 
unspoken rules and regulations. These regulations remain latent as long as the amities or hostilities 
proceed according to Hoyle, but they become manifest if an illegal move is made, giving rise to a 
symbolic, verbal or legal cry of ""Foul!"" Such sequences, which in contrast to pastimes are based 
more on individual than on social programming, may be called games. Family life and married life, 
as well as life in organizations of various kinds, may year after year be based on variations of the 
same game. 
To say that the bulk of social activity consists of playing games does not necessarily mean that it is 
mostly ""fun"" or that the parties are not seriously engaged in the relationship. On the one hand, 
""playing"" football and other athletic ""games"" may not be fun at all, and the players may be 
intensely grim; and such games share with gambling and other forms of ""play"" the potentiality for 
being very serious indeed, sometimes fatal. On the other hand, some authors, for instance Huizinga, 
9 include under ""play"" such serious things as cannibal feasts. Hence calling such tragic behavior as 
suicide, alcohol and drug addiction, criminality or schizophrenia ""playing games"" is not 
irresponsible, facetious or barbaric. The essential characteristic of human play is not that the 
emotions are spurious, but that they are regulated. This is revealed when sanctions are imposed on 
an illegitimate emotional display. Play may be grimly serious, or even fatally serious, but the social 
sanctions are serious only if the rules are broken. 
Pastimes and games are substitutes for the real living of real intimacy. Because of this they may be 
regarded as preliminary engagements rather than as unions, which is why they are characterized as 
poignant forms of play. Intimacy begins when individual (usually instinctual) programming 
becomes more intense, and both social patterning and ulterior restrictions and motives begin to give 
way. It is the only completely satisfying answer to stimulus-hunger, recognition-hunger and 
structure-hunger. Its prototype is the act of loving impregnation. 
Structure-hunger has the same survival value as stimulus-hunger. Stimulus-hunger and recognition-
hunger express the need to avoid sensory and emotional starvation, both of which lead to biological 
deterioration. Structure-hunger expresses the need to avoid boredom, and Kierkegaard10 has 
pointed out the evils which result from unstructured time. If it persists for any length of time, 
boredom becomes synonymous with emotional starvation and can have the same consequences. 
The solitary individual can structure time in two ways: activity and fantasy. An individual can 
remain solitary even in the presence of others, as every schoolteacher knows. When one is a 
member of a social aggregation of two or more people, there are several options for structuring 
time. In order of complexity, these are: (1) Rituals (2) Pastimes (3) Games (4) Intimacy and (5) 
Activity, which may form a matrix for any of the others. The goal of each member of the 
aggregation is to obtain as many satisfactions as possible from his transactions with other members. 
The more accessible he is, the more satisfactions he can obtain. Most of the programming of his 
social operations is automatic. Since some of the ""satisfactions"" obtained under this programming, 
such as self-destructive ones, are difficult to recognize in the usual sense of the word 
""satisfactions,"" it would be better to substitute some more non-committal terra, such as ""gains"" or 
""advantages."" 
The advantages of social contact revolve around somatic and psychic equilibrium. They are related 
to the following factors: (1) the relief of tension (2) the avoidance of noxious situations (3) the 
procurement of stroking and (4) the maintenance of an established equilibrium. All these items 
have been investigated and discussed in great detail by physiologists, psychologists, and 
psychoanalysts. Translated into terms of social psychiatry, they may be stated as (1) the primary 
internal advantages (2) the primary external advantages (3) the secondary advantages and (4) the 
existential advantages. The first three parallel the ""gains from illness"" described by Freud: the 
internal paranosic gain, the external paranosic gain, and the eplnosic gain, respectively.11 
Experience has shown that it is more useful and enlightening to investigate social transactions from 
the point of view of the advantages gained than to treat them as defensive operations. In the first 
place, the best defense is to engage in no transactions at all; in the second place, the concept of 

6

 
""defenses"" covers only part of the first two classes of advantages, and the rest of them, together 
with the third and fourth classes, are lost to this point of view. 
The most gratifying forms of social contact, whether or not they are embedded in a matrix of 
activity, are games and intimacy. Prolonged intimacy is rare, and even then it is primarily a private 
matter; significant social intercourse most commonly takes the form of games, and that is the 
subject which principally concerns us here. For further information about rime-structuring, the 
author's book on group dynamics should be consulted.

PART I 
Analysis of Games 

CHAPTER ONE 
Structural Analysis 
OBSERVATION of spontaneous social activity, most productively carried out in certain kinds of 
psychotherapy groups, reveals that from time to time people show noticeable changes in posture, 
viewpoint, voice, vocabulary, and other aspects of behavior. These behavioral changes are often 
accompanied by shifts in feeling. In given individual, a certain patterns correspond to one state of 
mind, while another set is related to a different psychic attitude, often inconsistent with the first. 
These changes and differences give rise to the idea of “ego states”. 
In technical language, an ego state may be described phenomenologically as a coherent system of 
feelings, and operationally as a set of coherent behavior patterns. In more practical terms, it is a 
system of feelings accompanied by a related set of behavior patterns. Each individual seems to have 
available a limited repertoire of such ego states, which are not roles but psychological realities. 
This repertoire can be sorted into the following categories: CO ego states which resemble those of 
parental figures (2) ego states which are autonomously directed toward objective appraisal of 
reality and (B) those which represent archaic relics, still-active ego states which were fixated in 
early childhood. Technically these are called, respectively, extero-psychic, neopsychic, and 
archaeopsychic ego states. Colloquially their exhibitions are called Parent, Adult and Child, and 
these simple terms serve for all but the most formal discussions. 
The position is, then, that at any given moment each individual in a social aggregation will exhibit 
a Parental, Adult or Child ego state, and that individuals can shift with varying degrees of readiness 
from one ego state to another. These observations give rise to certain diagnostic statements. ""That 
is your Parent"" means: ""You are now in the same state of mind as one of your parents (or a parental 
substitute) used to be, and you are responding as he would, with the same posture, gestures, 
vocabulary, feelings, etc."" ""That is your Adult"" means: ""You have just made an autonomous, 
objective appraisal of the situation and are stating these thought-processes, or the problems you 
perceive, or the conclusions you have come to, in a non-prejudicial manner."" ""That is your Child"" 
means: ""The manner and intent of your reaction is the same as it would have been when you were a 
very little boy or girl."" The implications are: 
1. That every individual has had parents (or substitute parents) and that he carries within him a set 
of ego states that reproduce the ego states of those parents (as he perceived them), and that these 
parental ego states can be activated under certain circumstances (exteropsychic functioning). 
Colloquially: ""Everyone carries his parents around inside of him."" 
2. That every individual (including children, the mentally retarded and schizophrenics) is capable 
of objective data processing if the appropriate ego state can be activated (neopsychic functioning). 
Colloquially: ""Everyone has an Adult."" 
3. That every individual was once younger than he is now, and that he carries within him fixated 
relics from earlier years which will be activated under certain circumstances (archaeopsychic 
functioning). Colloquially: ""Everyone carries a little boy or girl around inside of him."" 
At this point it is appropriate to draw Figure I (A), which is called a structural diagram. This 
represents, from the present viewpoint, a diagram of the complete personality of any individual. It 
includes his Parental, Adult, and Child ego states. They are carefully segregated from each other, 
because they are so different and because they are so often quite inconsistent with each other. The 
distinctions may not be clear at first to an inexperienced observer, but soon become impressive and 
interesting to anyone who takes the trouble to learn structural diagnosis. It will be convenient 
henceforth to call actual people parents, adults or children, with no capital letters; Parent, Adult and 
Child, capitalized, will be used when ego states are referred to. Figure 1(B) represents a convenient, 
simplified form of the structural diagram.

Before we leave the subject of structural analysis, certain complications should be mentioned. 
1. The word ""childish"" is never used in structural analysis, since it has come to have strong 
connotations of undesirability, and of something to be stopped forthwith or gotten rid of. The term 
""childlike"" is used in describing the Child (an archaic ego state), since it is more biological and not 
prejudicial. Actually the Child is in many ways the most valuable part of the personality, and can 
contribute to the individual's life exactly what an actual child can contribute to family life: charm, 
pleasure and creativity. If the Child in the individual is confused and unhealthy, then the 
consequences may be unfortunate, but something can and should be done about it. 
2. The same applies to the words ""mature"" and ""immature."" In this system there is no such thing as 
an ""immature person."" There are only people in whom the Child takes over inappropriately or 
unproductively, but all such people have a complete, well-structured Adult which only needs to be 
uncovered or activated. Conversely, so-called ""mature people"" are people who are able to keep the 
Adult in control most of the time, but their Child will take over on occasion like anyone else's, 
often with disconcerting results. 
3. It should be noted that the Parent is exhibited in two forms, direct and indirect: as an active ego 
state, and as an influence. When it is directly active, the person responds as his own father (or 
mother) actually responded (""Do as I do""). When it is an indirect influence, he responds the way 
they wanted him to respond (""Don't do as I do, do as I say""). In the first case he becomes one of 
them; in the second, he adapts himself to their requirements. 
4. Thus the Child is also exhibited in two forms: the adapted Child and the natural Child. The 
adapted Child is the one who modifies his behavior under the Parental influence. He behaves as 
father (or mother) wanted him to behave: compliantly or precociously, for example. Or he adapts 
himself by withdrawing or whining. Thus the Parental influence is a cause, and the adapted Child 
an effect. The natural Child is a spontaneous expression: rebellion or creativity, for example. A 
confirmation of structural analysis is seen in the results of alcohol intoxication. Usually this 
decommissions the Parent first, so that the adapted Child is freed of the Parental influence, and is 
transformed by release into the natural Child. 
It is seldom necessary, for effective game analysis, to go beyond what has been outlined above as 
far as personality structure is concerned. 
Ego states are normal physiological phenomena. The human brain is the organ or organizer of 
psychic life, and its products ate organized and stored in the form of ego states. There is already 
concrete evidence for this in some findings of Penfield and his associates.1-2 There are other 
sorting systems at various levels, such as factual memory, but the natural form of experience itself 
is in shifting states of mind. Each type of ego state has its own vital value for the human organism. 

9

 
 
 
 
 
In the Child reside intuition,3 creativity and spontaneous drive and enjoyment. 
The Adult is necessary for survival. It processes data and computes the probabilities which are 
essential for dealing effectively with the outside world. It also experiences its own kinds of 
setbacks and gratifications. Crossing a busy highway, for example, requires the processing of a 
complex series of velocity data; action is suspended until the computations indicate a high degree 
of probability for reaching the other side safely. The gratifications offered by successful 
computations of this type afford some of the joys of skiing, flying, sailing, and other mobile sports. 
Another task of the Adult is to regulate the activities of the Parent and the Child, and to mediate 
objectively between them. 
The Parent has two main functions. First, it enables the individual to act effectively as the parent of 
actual children, thus promoting the survival of the human race. Its value in this respect is shown by 
the fact that in raising children, people orphaned in infancy seem to have a harder time than those 
from homes unbroken into adolescence. Secondly, it makes many responses automatic, which 
conserves a great deal of time and energy. Many things are done because ""That's the way it's done."" 
This frees the Adult from the necessity of making innumerable trivial decisions, so that it can 
devote itself to more important issues, leaving routine matters to the Parent. Thus all three aspects 
of the personality have a high survival and living value, and it is only when one or the other of 
them disturbs the healthy balance that analysis and reorganization are indicated. Otherwise, each of 
them, Parent, Adult, and Child, have right to be respected. Each has legitimate place in a full and 
productive life.

CHAPTER TWO 
Transactional Analysis 
THE unit of social intercourse is called a transaction. If two or more people encounter each other in 
a social aggregation, sooner or later one of them will speak, or give some other indication of 
acknowledging the presence of the others. This is called the transactional stimulus. Another person 
will then say or do something which is in some way related to this stimulus, and that is called the 
transactions/ response. Simple transactional analysis is concerned with diagnosing which ego state 
implemented the transactional stimulus, and which one executed the transactional response. The 
simplest transactions are those in which both stimulus and response arise from the Adults of the 
parties concerned. The agent, estimating from the data before him that a scalpel is now the 
instrument of choice, holds out his hand. The respondent appraises this gesture correctly, estimates 
the forces and distances involved, and places the handle of the scalpel exactly where the surgeon 
expects it. Next in simplicity are Child-Parent transactions. The fevered Child asks for a glass of 
water, and the nurturing mother brings it. 
Both these transactions are complementary; that is, the response is appropriate and expected and 
follows the natural order of healthy human relationships. The first, which is classified as 
Complementary Transaction Type I, is represented in Figure 2A. The second, Complementary 
Transaction Type II, is shown in Figure 2B. It is evident, however, that transactions tend to proceed 
in chains, so that each response is in mm a stimulus. The first rule of communication is that 
communication will proceed smoothly as long as transactions are complementary, and its corollary 
is that as long as transactions are complementary, communication can, in principle, proceed 
indefinitely. These rules are independent of the nature and content of the transactions; they are 
based entirely on the direction of the vectors involved. As long as the transactions are 

10

 
 
 
complementary, it is irrelevant to the rule whether two people are engaging in critical gossip 
(Parent-Parent), solving a problem (Adult-Adult), or playing together (Child-Child or Parent-Child).

The converse rule is that communication is broken off when a crossed transaction occurs. The most 
common crossed transaction and the one which causes and always has caused most of the social 
difficulties in the world, whether in marriage, love, friendship, or work is represented in Figure 3A 
as Crossed Transaction Type I. This type of transaction is the principal concern of psychotherapists 
and is typified by the classical transference reaction of psychoanalysis. The stimulus is Adult-Adult: 
e.g., ""Maybe we should find out why you've been drinking more lately,"" or, ""Do you know where 
my cuff links are?"" The appropriate Adult-Adult response in each case would be: ""Maybe we 
should. I'd certainly like to know!"" or, “On the desk.” If the respondent flares up, however, the 
responses will be something like ""You're always criticizing me, just like my father did,"" or, ""You 
always blame me for everything."" These are both Child-Parent responses, and as the transactional 
diagram shows, the vectors cross. In such cases the Adult problems about drinking or cuff links 
must be suspended until the vectors can be realigned. This may take anywhere from several months 
in the drinking example to a few seconds in the case of cuff links. Either the agent must become 
Parental as a complement to the respondent's suddenly activated Child, or the respondent's Adult 
must be reactivated as a complement to the agent's Adult. If the maid rebels during a discussion of 
dishwashing, the Adult-Adult conversation about dishes is finished; there can only ensue either a 
Child-Parent discourse, or a discussion of a different Adult subject, namely her continued 
employment.

The converse of Crossed Transaction Type I is illustrated in Figure 3B. This is the counter-
transference reaction familiar to psychotherapists, in which the patient makes an objective, Adult 
observation, and the therapist crosses the vectors by responding like a parent talking to a child. This 
is Crossed Transaction Type II. In everyday life, ""Do you know where my cuff links are?"" may 
elicit: ""Why don't you keep track of your own things? You're not a child any more."" 
The relationship diagram in Figure 4, showing the nine possible vectors of social action between an 
agent and a respondent, has some interesting geometrical (topological) qualities. Complementary 
transactions between ""psychological equals"" are represented by (1 —I)2, (5—5)2 and (9—9)2. There 
are three other complementary transactions: (2-4) (4-2), (3-7) (7-3) and (6-8) (8-6). All other 
combinations form crossed transactions, and in most cases these show up as crossings in the 
diagram: e.g., (3—7) (3—7), which results in two speechless people glaring at each other. If neither 
of them gives way, communication is finished and they must part. The most common solutions are 

12

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for one to yield and take (7—3), which results in a game of ""Uproar""; or better, (5—5)2, in which 
case they both burst out laughing or shake hands. Simple complementary transactions most 
commonly occur in superficial working and social relationships, and these are easily disturbed by 
simple crossed transactions. In fact a superficial relationship may be defined as one which is 
confined to simple complementary transactions. Such relationships occur in activities, rituals and 
pastimes. More complex are ulterior transactions—those involving the activity of more than two 
ego states simultaneously—and this category is the basis for games. Salesmen are particularly adept 
at angular transactions, those involving three ego states. A crude but dramatic example of a sales 
game is illustrated in the following exchange: 
Salesman: ""This one is better, but you can't afford it.""  
Housewife: ""That's the one I'll take."" 
The analysis of this transaction is shown in Figure 5A. The salesman, as Adult, states two objective 
facts: ""This one is better"" and ""You can't afford it."" At the ostensible, or social, level these are 
directed to the Adult of the housewife, whose Adult reply would be: ""You are correct on both 
counts."" However, the ulterior, or -psychological, vector is directed by the well-trained and 
experienced Adult of the salesman to the housewife's Child. The correctness of his judgment is 
demonstrated by the Child's reply, which says in effect: ""Regardless of the financial consequences, 
I'll show that arrogant fellow I'm as good as any of his customers."" At both levels the transaction is 
complementary, since her reply is accepted at face value as an Adult purchasing contract. 
A duplex ulterior transaction involves four ego states, and is commonly seen in flirtation games.

As shown in Figure 5B, at the social level this is an Adult conversation about barns, and at the 
psychological level it is a Child conversation about sex play. On the surface the Adult seems to 
have the initiative, but as in most games, the outcome is determined by the Child, and the 
participants may be in for a surprise. 
Transactions may be classified, then, as complementary or crossed, simple or ulterior, and ulterior 
transactions may be subdivided into angular and duplex types.

CHAPTER THREE 
Procedures and Rituals 
TRANSACTIONS usually proceed in series. These series are not random, but are programmed. 
Programming may come from one of three sources: Parent, Adult or Child, or more generally, from 
society, material or idiosyncrasy- Since the needs of adaptation require that the Child may be 
shielded by the Parent or Adult until each social situation has been tested, Child programming is 
most apt to occur in situations of privacy and intimacy, where preliminary testing has already been 
done. 
The simplest forms of social activity are procedures and rituals. Some of these are universal and 
some local, but all of them have to be learned. A -procedure is a series of simple complementary 
Adult transactions directed toward the manipulation of reality. Reality is defined as having two 
aspects: static and dynamic. Static reality comprises all the possible arrangements of matter in the 
universe. Arithmetic, for example, consists of statements about static reality. Dynamic reality may 
be defined as the potentialities for interaction of all the energy systems in the universe. Chemistry, 
for example, consists of statements about dynamic reality. Procedures are based on data processing 
and probability estimates concerning the material of reality, and reach their highest development in 
professional techniques. Piloting an airplane and removing an appendix are procedures. 
Psychotherapy is a procedure insofar as it is under the control of the therapist's Adult, and it is not a 
procedure insofar as his Parent or Child takes over the executive. The programming of a procedure 
is determined by the material, on the basis of estimates made by the agent's Adult. 
Two variables are used in evaluating procedures. A procedure is said to be efficient when the agent 
makes the best possible use of the data and experience available to him, regardless of any 
deficiencies that may exist in his knowledge. If the Parent or the Child interferes with the Adult's 
data processing, the procedure becomes contaminated and will be less efficient. The effectiveness 
of a procedure is judged by the actual results. Thus efficiency is a psychological criterion and 
effectiveness is a material one. A native assistant medical officer on a tropical island became very 
adept at removing cataracts. He used what knowledge he had with a very high degree of efficiency, 
but since he knew less than the European medical officer, he was not quite as effective. The 
European began to drink heavily so that his efficiency dropped, but at first his effectiveness was not 
diminished. But when his hands became tremulous as the years went by, his assistant began to 
surpass him not only in efficiency, but also in effectiveness. It can be seen from this example that 
both of these variables are best evaluated by an expert in the procedures involved—efficiency by 
personal acquaintance with the agent, and effectiveness by surveying the actual results. 
From the present viewpoint, a ritual is a stereotyped series of simple complementary transactions 
programmed by external social forces. An informal ritual, such as social leave-taking, may be 
subject to considerable local variations in details, although the basic form remains the same. A 
formal ritual, such as a Roman Catholic Mass, offers much less option. The form of a ritual is 
Parentally determined by tradition, but more recent ""parental"" influences may have similar but less 
stable effects in trivial instances. Some formal rituals of special historical or anthropological 
interest have two phases: (1) a phase in which transactions are carried on under rigid Parental 
strictures (2) a phase of Parental license, in which the Child is allowed more or less complete 
transactional freedom, resulting in an orgy. 
Many formal rituals started off as heavily contaminated though fairly efficient procedures, but as 
time passed and circumstances changed, they lost all procedural validity while still retaining their 
usefulness as acts of faith. Trans-actionally they represent guilt-relieving or reward-seeking 
compliances with traditional Parental demands. They offer a safe, reassuring (apotropaic), and 
often enjoyable method of structuring time. 
Of more significance as an introduction to game analysis are informal rituals, and among the most 
instructive are the American greeting rituals. 

1A; 
1B: 

""Hi!"" (Hello, good morning.) 
""Hi!"" (Hello, good morning.) 

14

 
 
2A: 
2B: 
3A: 
3B: 
4A: 
4B: 

""Warm enough for ya?"" (How are you?) 
""Sure is. Looks like rain, though."" (Fine. How are you?) 
""Well, take cara yourself."" (Okay.) 
""I'll be seeing you."" 
""So long."" 
""So long."" 

It is apparent that this exchange is not intended to convey information. Indeed, if there is any 
information, it is wisely withheld. It might take Mr. A fifteen minutes to say how he is, and Mr. B, 
who is only the most casual acquaintance, has no intention of devoting that much time to listening 
to him. This series of transactions is quite adequately characterized by calling it an ""eight-stroke 
ritual."" If A and B were in a hurry, they might both be contented with a two-stroke exchange, Hi-Hi. 
If they were old-fashioned Oriental potentates, they might go through a two-hundred stroke ritual 
before settling down to business. Meanwhile, in the jargon of transactional analysis, A and B have 
improved each other's health slightly; for the moment, at least, ""their spinal cords won't shrivel up,"" 
and each is accordingly grateful. 
This ritual is based on careful intuitive computations by both parties. At this stage of their 
acquaintance they figure that they owe each other exactly four strokes at each meeting, and not 
oftener than once a day. If they run into each other again shortly, say within the next half hour, and 
have no new business to transact, they will pass by without any sign, or with only the slightest nod 
of recognition, or at most with a very perfunctory Hi-Hi. These computations hold not only for 
short intervals but over periods of several months. Let us now consider Mr. C and Mr. D, who pass 
each other about once a day, trade one stroke each—Hi-Hi —and go their ways. Mr. C goes on a 
month's vacation. The day after he returns, he encounters Mr. D as usual. If on this occasion Mr. D 
merely says ""Hi!"" and no more, Mr. C will be offended, ""his spinal cord will shrivel slightly."" By 
his calculations, Mr. D and he owe each other about thirty strokes. These can be compressed into a 
few transactions, if those transactions are emphatic enough. Mr. D's side properly runs something 
like this (where each unit of ""intensity"" or ""interest"" is equivalent to a stroke): 

ID: ""Hi!"" (1 unit.) 
2D: ""Haven't seen you around lately."" (2 units.)  
3D: ""Oh, have you! Where did you go?"" (5 units.)  
4D: ""Say, that's interesting. How was it?"" (7 units.)  
5D: ""Well, you're sure looking fine."" (4 units.) ""Did your family go along?"" (4 units.) 
6D: ""Well, glad to see you back."" (4 units.)  
7D: ""So long."" (I unit.) 

This gives Mr. D a total of 28 units. Both he and Mr. C know that he will make up the missing units 
the following day, so the account is now, for all practical purposes, squared. Two days later they 
will be back at their two-stroke exchange, Hi-Hi. But now they ""know each other better,"" i.e., each 
knows the other is reliable, and this may be useful if they should meet ""socially."" 
The inverse case is also worth considering. Mr. E and Mr. F have set up a two-stroke ritual, Hi-Hi. 
One day instead of passing on, Mr. E stops and asks: ""How are you?"" The conversation proceeds as 
follows: 

IE: ""Hi!"" 
 IF: ""Hi!' 
2E: ""How are you?""  
2F (Puzzled'): ""Fine. How are you?""  
3E: ""Everything's great. Warm enough for you?""  
3F: ""Yeah."" (Cautiously.) ""Looks like rain, though.""  
4E: ""Nice to see you again."" 

15

 
 
 
 
 
4F: ""Same here. Sorry, I've got to get to the library before it closes. So long.""  
5E: ""So long."" 

As Mr. F hurries away, he thinks to himself: ""What's come over him all of a sudden? Is he selling 
insurance or something?"" In transactional terms this reads: ""All he owes me is one stroke, why is he 
giving me five?"" 
An even simpler demonstration of the truly transactional business-like nature of these simple rituals 
is the occasion when Mr. G says ""Hi!"" and Mr. H passes on without replying. Mr. G's reaction is 
""What's the matter with him?"" meaning: ""I gave him a stroke and he didn't give me one in return."" 
If Mr. H keeps this up and extends it to other acquaintances, he is going to cause some talk in his 
community. 
In borderline cases it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a procedure and a ritual. The 
tendency is for the layman to call professional procedures rituals, while actually every transaction 
may be based on sound, even vital experience, but the layman does not have the background to 
appreciate that. Conversely, there is a tendency for professionals to rationalize ritualistic elements 
that still cling to their procedures, and to dismiss skeptical laymen on the ground that they are not 
equipped to understand. And one of the ways in which entrenched professionals may resist the 
introduction of sound new procedures is by laughing them off as rituals. Hence the fate of 
Semmelweis and other innovators. 
The essential and similar feature of both procedures and rituals is that they are stereotyped. Once 
the first transaction has been initiated, the whole series is predictable and follows a predetermined 
course to a foreordained conclusion unless special conditions arise. The difference between them 
lies in the origin of the predetermination: procedures are programmed by the Adult and rituals are 
Parentally patterned. 
Individuals who are not comfortable or adept with rituals sometimes evade them by substituting 
procedures. They can be found, for example, among people who like to help the hostess with 
preparing or serving food and drink at parties. 

CHAPTER FOUR 
Pastimes 
PASTIMES occur in social and temporal matrices of varying degrees of complexity, and hence 
vary in complexity. However, if we use the transaction as the unit of social intercourse, we can 
dissect out of appropriate situations an entity which may be called a simple pastime. This may be 
defined as a series of semi-ritualistic, simple, complementary transactions arranged around a single 
field of material, whose primary object is to structure an interval of time. The beginning and end of 
the interval are typically signaled by procedures or rituals. The transactions are adaptively 
programmed so that each party will obtain the maximum gains or advantages during the interval. 
The better his adaptation, the more he will get out of it. 
Pastimes are typically played at parties (""social gatherings"") or during the waiting period before a 
formal group meeting begins; such waiting periods before a meeting ""begins"" have the same 
structure and dynamics as ""parries."" Pastimes may take the form described as ""chit-chat"" or they 
may become more serious, e.g., argumentative. A large cocktail party often functions as a kind of 
gallery for the exhibition of pastimes. In one corner of the room a few people are playing ""PTA,"" 
another corner is the forum for ""Psychiatry,"" a third is the theater for ""Ever Been"" or ""What 
Became,"" the fourth is engaged for ""General Motors,"" and the buffet is reserved for women who 
want to play ""Kitchen"" or ""Wardrobe."" The proceedings at such a gathering may be almost identical, 
with a change of names here and there, with the proceedings at a dozen similar parties taking place 
simultaneously in the area. At another dozen in a different social stratum, a different assortment of 
pastimes is underway. 
Pastimes may be classified in different ways. The external determinants are sociological (sex, age, 
marital status, cultural, racial or economic). ""General Motors"" (comparing cars) and ""Who Won"" 

16

 
 
 
(sports) are both ""Man Talk."" ""Grocery,"" ""Kitchen,"" and ""Wardrobe"" are all ""Lady Talk"" —or, as 
practiced in the South Seas, ""Mary Talk."" ""Making Out"" is adolescent, while the onset of middle 
age is marked by a shift to ""Balance Sheet."" Other species of this class, which are all variations of 
""Small Talk,"" are: ""How To"" (go about doing something), an easy filler for short airplane trips; 
""How Much"" (does it cost), a favorite in lower-middle-class bars; ""Ever Been (to some nostalgic 
place), a middle-class game for ""old hands"" such as salesmen; ""Do You Know"" (so-and-so) for 
lonely ones; ""What Became"" (of good old Joe), often played by economic successes and failures; 
""Morning After"" (what a hangover) and ""Martini"" (I know a better way), typical of a certain kind of 
ambitious young person. 
The structural-transactional classification is a more personal one. Thus ""PTA"" may be played at 
three levels. At the Child-Child level it takes the form of ""How Do You Deal with Recalcitrant 
Parents""; its Adult-Adult form, ""PTA"" proper, is popular among well-read young mothers; with 
older people it tends to take the dogmatic Parent-Parent form of ""Juvenile Delinquency."" Some 
married couples play ""Tell Them Dear,"" in which the wife is Parental and the husband comes 
through like a precocious child. ""Look Ma No Hands"" is similarly a Child-Parent pastime suitable 
for people of any age, sometimes diffidently adapted into ""Aw Shucks Fellows."" 
Even more cogent is the psychological classification of pastimes. Both ""PTA"" and ""Psychiatry"" for 
example, may be played in either projective or introjective forms. The analysis of ""PTA"",  
Projective Type is represented in Figure 6A, based on the following Parent-Parent paradigm: 
A: ""There wouldn't be all this delinquency if it weren't for broken homes."" 
B: ""It's not only that. Even in good homes nowadays the children aren't taught manners the way 
they used to be."" 
""PTA,"" Introjective Type runs along the following lines (Adult-Adult): 
C: ""I just don't seem to have what it takes to be a mother."" 
D: ""No matter how hard you try, they never grow up the way you want them to, so you have to keep 
wondering if you're doing the right thing and what mistakes you've made."" 
""Psychiatry"" Projective Type takes the Adult-Adult form: 
E: ""I think it's some unconscious oral frustration that makes him act that way."" 
F: ""You seem to have your aggressions so well sublimated."" 
Figure 6B represents ""Psychiatry,"" Introjective Type, another Adult-Adult pastime. 
G: ""That painting symbolizes smearing to me."" 
H: ""In my case, painting is trying to please my father."" 
Besides structuring time and providing mutually acceptable stroking for the parties concerned, 
pastimes serve the additional function of being social-selection processes. While a pastime is in 
progress, the Child in each player is watchfully assessing the potentialities of the others involved. 
At the end of the party, each person will have selected certain players he would like to see more of, 
while others he will discard, regardless of how skillfully or pleasantly they each engaged in the 
pastime. The ones he selects are those who seem the most likely candidates for more complex 
relationships—that is, games. This sorting system, however well rationalized, is actually largely 
unconscious and intuitive.

(b) Introjective ""Psychiatry""

In special cases the Adult overrides the Child in the selection process. This is most clearly 
illustrated by an insurance salesman who carefully learns to play social pastimes. While he is 
playing, his Adult listens for possible prospects and selects them from the players as people he 
would like to see more of. Their adeptness at games or congeniality is quite irrelevant to his process 
of selection, which is based, as in most cases, on peripheral factors—in this instance, financial 
readiness. 
Pastimes, however, have a quite specific aspect of exclusiveness. For example, ""Man Talk"" and 
""Lady Talk"" do not mix. People playing a hard hand of ""Ever Been"" (there) will be annoyed by an 
intruder who wants to play ""How Much"" (for avocados) or ""Morning After."" People playing 
Projective ""PTA"" will resent the intrusion of Introjective ""PTA,"" although usually not as intensely 
as the other way around. 
Pastimes form the basis for the selection of acquaintances, and may lead to friendship. A party of 
women who drop in at each other's houses every morning for coffee to play ""Delinquent Husband"" 
are likely to give a cool reception to a new neighbor who wants to play ""Sunny Side Up."" If they 
are saying how mean their husbands are, it is too disconcerting to have a newcomer declare that her 
husband is just marvelous, in fact perfect, and they will not keep her long. So at a cocktail party, if 
someone wants to move from one corner to another, he must either join in the pastime played in his 
new location or else successfully switch the whole proceeding into a new channel. A good hostess, 
of course, takes the situation in hand immediately and states the program: ""We were just playing 
Projective 'PTA.' What do you think' Or: ""Come now, you girls have been playing 'Wardrobe' long 
enough. Mr. J. here is a writer/politician/surgeon, and I'm sure he'd like to play 'Look Ma No 
Hands.' Wouldn't you, Mr. F"" 
Another important advantage obtained from pastimes is the confirmation of role and the stabilizing 
of position. A role is something like what Jung calls persona, except that it is less opportunistic and 
more deeply rooted in the individual's fantasies. Thus in Projective ""PTA"" one player may take the 
role of tough Parent, another the role of righteous Parent, a third the role of indulgent Parent and a 
fourth the role of helpful Parent. All four experience and exhibit a Parental ego state, but each 
presents himself differently. The role of each one is confirmed if it prevails —that is, if it meets 
with no antagonism or is strengthened by any antagonism it meets or is approved by certain types 
of people with stroking. 
The confirmation of his role stabilizes the individual's position, and this is called the existential 
advantage from the pastime. A position is a simple predicative statement which influences all of the 
individual's transactions; in the long run it determines his destiny and often that of his descendants 

18

 
 
 
 
as well. A position may be more or less absolute. Typical positions from which Projective ""PTA"" 
can be played are: ""All children are bad!"" ""All other children are bad!"" ""All children are sad!"" ""All 
children are persecuted!"" These positions might give rise to the role of die tough, the righteous, the 
indulgent and the helpful Parent, respectively. Actually a position is primarily manifested by the 
mental attitude to which it gives rise, and it is with this attitude that the individual undertakes the 
transactions which constitute his role. 
Positions are taken and become fixed surprisingly early, from the second or even the first year to 
the seventh year of life—in any case long before the individual is competent or experienced enough 
to make such a serious commitment. It is not difficult to deduce from an individual's position the 
kind of childhood he must have had. Unless something or somebody intervenes, he spends the rest 
of his life stabilizing his position and dealing with situations that threaten it: by avoiding them, 
warding other certain elements or manipulating them provocatively so that they are transformed 
from threats into justifications. One reason pastimes are so stereotyped is that they serve such 
stereotyped purposes. But the gains they offer show why people play them so eagerly, and why 
they can be so pleasant if played with people who have constructive or benevolent positions to 
maintain. 
A pastime is not always easy to distinguish from an activity, and combinations frequently occur. 
Many commonplace pastimes, such as ""General Motors,"" consist of what psychologists might call 
Multiple-Choice—Sentence-Completion exchanges. 
A. ""I like a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth better than a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth because. . . ."" 
B. ""Oh. Well, I'd rather have a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth than a Ford/Chevrolet/Plymouth 
because. . . ."" 
It is apparent that there may actually be some useful information conveyed in such stereotypes, 
A few other common pastimes may be mentioned. ""Me Too"" is often a variant of ""Ain't It Awful."" 
""Why Don't They"" (do something about it) is a favorite among housewives who do not wish to be 
emancipated. ""Then We'll"" is a Child-Child pastime. ""Let's Find"" (something to do) is played by 
juvenile delinquents or mischievous grown-ups. 

CHAPTER FIVE 
Games 

1 DEFINITION 
A GAME is an ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions progressing to a well-defined, 
predictable outcome. Descriptively it is a recurring set of transactions, often repetitious, 
superficially plausible, with a concealed motivation; or, more colloquially, a series of moves with a 
snare, or ""gimmick."" Games are clearly differentiated from procedures, rituals, and pastimes by two 
chief characteristics: (I) their ulterior quality and (2) the payoff. Procedures may be successful, 
rituals effective, and pastimes profitable, but all of them are by definition candid; they may involve 
contest, but not conflict, and the ending may be sensational, but it is not dramatic. Every game, on 
the other hand, is basically dishonest, and the outcome has a dramatic, as distinct from merely 
exciting, quality. 
It remains to distinguish games from the one remaining type of social action which so far has not 
been discussed. An operation is a simple transaction or set of transactions undertaken for a specific, 
stated purpose. If someone frankly asks for reassurance and gets it, that is an operation. If someone 
asks for reassurance, and after it is given turns it in some way to the disadvantage of the giver, that 
is a game. Superficially, then, a game looks like a set of operations, but after the payoff it becomes 
apparent that these operations were really maneuvers; not honest requests but moves in the game. 
In the ""insurance game,"" for example, no matter what the agent appears to be doing in conversation, 
if he is a hard player he is really looking for or working on a prospect. What he is after, if he is 
worth his salt, is to ""make a killing."" The same applies to ""the real estate game,"" ""the panama 
game"" and similar occupations- Hence at a social gathering, while a salesman is engaged in 
pastimes, particularly variants of ""Balance Sheet,"" his congenial participation may conceal a series 

19

 
of skillful maneuvers designed to elicit the kind of information he is professionally interested in. 
There are dozens of trade journals devoted to improving commercial maneuvers, and which give 
accounts of outstanding players and games (interesting operators who make unusually big deals). 
Transactionally speaking, these are merely variants of Sports Illustrated, Chess World, and other 
sports magazines. 
As far as angular transactions are concerned—games which are consciously planned with 
professional precision under Adult control to yield the maximum gains—the big ""con games"" 
which flourished in the early 1900's are hard to surpass for detailed practical planning and 
psychological virtuosity. 
What we are concerned with here, however, are the unconscious games played by innocent people 
engaged in duplex transactions of which they are not fully aware, and which form the most 
important aspect of social life all over the world. Because of their dynamic qualities, games are 
easy to distinguish from mere static attitudes, which arise from taking a position. 
The use of the word ""game"" should not be misleading. As explained in the introduction, it does not 
necessarily imply fun or even enjoyment. Many salesmen do not consider their work fun, as Arthur 
Miller made clear in his play, The Death- of a Salesman. And there may be no lack of seriousness. 
Football games nowadays are taken very seriously, but no more so than such transactional games as 
""Alcoholic"" or ""Third-Degree Rapo"". 
The same applies to the word ""play,"" as anyone who has ""played"" hard poker or ""played"" the stock 
market over a long period can testify. The possible seriousness of games and play, and the possibly 
serious results, are well known to anthropologists. The most complex game that ever existed, that 
of ""Courtier"" as described so well by Stendhal in The Charterhouse of Parma, was deadly serious. 
The grimmest of all, of course, is ""War."" 

2 A TYPICAL GAME 
The most common game played between spouses is colloquially called ""If It Weren't For You,"" and 
this will be used to illustrate the characteristics of games in general. 
Mrs. White complained that her husband severely restricted her social activities, so that she had 
never learned to dance. Due to changes in her attitude brought about by psychiatric treatment, her 
husband became less sure of himself and more indulgent. Mrs. White was then free to enlarge the 
scope of her activities. She signed up for dancing classes, and then discovered to her despair that 
she had a morbid fear of dance floors and had to abandon this project. 
This unfortunate adventure, along with similar ones, laid bare some important aspects of the 
structure of her marriage. Out of her many suitors she had picked a domineering man for a husband. 
She was then in a position to complain that she could do all sorts of things ""if it weren't for you."" 
Many of her women friends also had domineering husbands, and when they met for their morning 
coffee, they spent a good deal of time playing ""If It Weren't For Him."" 
As it turned out, however, contrary to her complaints, her husband was performing a very real 
service for her by forbidding her to do something she was deeply afraid of, and by preventing her, 
in fact, from even becoming aware of her fears. This was one reason her Child had shrewdly 
chosen such a husband. 
But there was more to it than that. His prohibitions and her complaints frequently led to quarrels, so 
that their sex life was seriously impaired. And because of his feelings of guilt, he frequently 
brought her gifts which might not otherwise have been forthcoming; certainly when he gave her 
more freedom, his gifts diminished in lavishness and frequency. She and her husband had little in 
common besides their household worries and the children, so that their quarrels stood out as 
important events; it was mainly on these occasions that they had anything but the most casual 
conversations. At any rate, her married life had proved one thing to her that she had always 
maintained: that ail men were mean and tyrannical. As it turned out, this attitude was related to 
some daydreams of being sexually abused which had plagued her in earlier years. 
There are various ways of describing this game in general terms. It is apparent that it belongs in the 
large field of social dynamics. The basic fact is that by marrying, Mr. and Mrs. White have an 

20

 
opportunity to communicate with each other, and such an opportunity may be called social contact. 
The fact that they use this opportunity makes their household a social aggregation, as contrasted 
with a New York subway train, for example, where people are in spatial contact but rarely avail 
themselves of the opportunity and so form a this-social aggregation. The influence the Whites exert 
on each other's behavior and responses constitutes social action. Various disciplines would 
investigate such social action from different points of view. Since we are here concerned with the 
personal histories and psycho-dynamics of the individuals involved, the present approach is one 
aspect of social -psychiatry; some implicit or explicit judgment is passed on the ""healthiness"" of the 
games studied. This is somewhat different from the more neutral and less committed attitudes of 
sociology and social psychology. Psychiatry reserves the right to say, ""Just a moment!"" which the 
other disciplines do not. Transactional analysis is a branch of social psychiatry, and game analysis 
is a special aspect of transactional analysis. 
Practical game analysis deals with special cases as they appear in specific situations. Theoretical 
game analysis attempts to abstract and generalize the characteristics of various games, so that they 
can be recognized independently of their momentary verbal content and their cultural matrix. The 
theoretical analysis of ""If It Weren't For You,"" Marital Type, for example, should state the 
characteristics of that game in such a way that it can be recognized just as easily in a New Guinea 
jungle village as in a Manhattan penthouse, whether it is concerned with a nuptial party or with the 
financial problems of getting a fishing rod for the grandchildren; and regardless of how bluntly or 
subtly the moves are made, according to the permissible degrees of frankness between husband and 
wife. The prevalence of the game in a given society is a matter for sociology and anthropology. 
Game analysis, as a part of social psychiatry, is only interested in describing the game when it does 
occur, regardless of how often that may be. This distinction is not complex, but it is analogous to 
the distinction between public health and internal medicine; the first is interested in the prevalence 
of malaria, while the latter studies cases of malaria as they come up, in the jungle or in Manhattan. 
At the present time the scheme given below has been round the most useful one for theoretical 
game analysis. No doubt it will be improved as further knowledge accumulates. The first requisite 
is to recognize that a certain sequence of maneuvers meets the criteria of a game. As many samples 
as possible of the game are then collected. The significant features of the collection are isolated. 
Certain aspects emerge as essential. These are then classified under headings which are designed to 
be as meaningful and instructive as possible in the current state of knowledge. The analysis is 
undertaken from the point of view of the one who is ""it""—in this case, Mrs. White. 
Thesis. This is a genera) description of the game, including the immediate sequence of events (the 
social level) and information about their psychological background, evolution and significance (the 
psychological level). In the case of ""If It Weren't For You,"" Marital Type, the details already given 
will serve (pp. 50-51). For the sake of brevity, this game will henceforth be referred to as IWFY. 
Antithesis. The presumption that a certain sequence constitutes a game is tentative until it has been 
existentially validated. This validation is carried out by a refusal to play or by undercutting the 
payoff. The one who is ""it"" will then make more intense efforts to continue the game. In the face of 
adamant refusal to play or a successful undercutting he will then lapse into a state called ""despair,"" 
which in some respects resembles a depression, but is different in significant ways. It is more acute 
and contains elements of frustration and bewilderment. It may be manifested, for example, by the 
onset of perplexed weeping. In a successful therapeutic situation this may soon be replaced by 
humorous laughter, implying an Adult realization: ""There I go again!"" Thus despair is a concern of 
the Adult, while in depression it is the Child who has the executive power. Hopefulness, 
enthusiasm or a lively interest in one's surroundings is the opposite of depression; laughter is the 
opposite of despair. Hence the enjoyable quality of therapeutic game analysis. The antithesis to 
IWFY is permissiveness. As long as the husband is prohibitive, the game can proceed. If instead of 
saying ""Don't you dare!"" he says ""Go ahead!"" the underlying phobias are unmasked, and the wife 
can no longer turn on him, as demonstrated in Mrs. White's case. 
For clear understanding of a game, the antithesis should be known and its effectiveness 
demonstrated in practice. 

21

 
Aim, This states simply the general purpose of the game. Sometimes there are alternatives. The aim 
of IWFY may be stated as either reassurance (""It's not that I'm afraid, it's that he won't let me"") or 
vindication (""It's not that I'm not trying, it's that he holds me back""). The reassuring function is 
easier to clarify and is more in accord with the security needs of the wife; therefore IWFY is most 
simply regarded as having the aim of reassurance. 
Roles. As previously noted, ego states are not roles but phenomena. Therefore ego states and roles 
have to be distinguished in a formal description. Games may be described as two-handed, three-
handed, many-handed, etc., according to the number of roles offered. Sometimes the ego state of 
each player corresponds to his role, sometimes it does not. 
IWFY is a two-handed game and calls For a restricted wife and a domineering husband. The wife 
may play her role either as a prudent Adult (""It's best that I do as he says"") or as a petulant Child. 
The domineering husband may preserve an Adult ego state (""It's best that you do as I say"") or slip 
into a Parental one (""You'd better do what I say""). 
Dynamics. There are alternatives in staring the psycho-dynamic driving forces behind each case of 
a game. It is usually possible, however, to pick out a single psychodynamic concept which usefully, 
aptly and meaningfully epitomizes the situation. Thus IWFY is best described as deriving from 
phobic sources. 
Examples. Since the childhood origins of a game, or its infantile prototypes, are instructive to 
study, it is worthwhile to search for such cognates in making a formal description. It happens that 
IFWY is just as frequently played by little children as by grown-ups, so the childhood version is the 
same as the later one, with the actual parent substituted for the restricting husband. 
Transactional Paradigm. The transactional analysis of a typical situation is presented, giving both 
the social and psychological levels of a revealing ulterior transaction. In its most dramatic form, 
IWFY at the social level is a Parent-Child game. 
Mr. White: ""You stay home and take care of the house."" 
Mrs. White: ""If it weren't for you, I could be out having fun."" 
At the psychological level (the ulterior marriage contract) the relationship is Child-Child, and quite 
different 
Mr. White: ""You must always be here when I get home. I'm terrified of desertion."" 
Mrs. White: ""I will be if you help me avoid phobic situations."" 
The two levels are illustrated in Figure 7.

Moves. The moves of a game correspond roughly to the strokes in a ritual. As in any game, the 
players become increasingly adept with practice. Wasteful moves are eliminated, and more and 
more purpose is condensed into each move. ""Beautiful friendships"" are often based on the fact that 
the players complement each other with great economy and satisfaction, so that there is a maximum 
yield with a minimum effort from the games they play with each other. Certain intermediate, 
precautionary or concessional moves can be eluded, giving a high degree of elegance to the 
relationship. The effort saved on defensive maneuvers can be devoted to ornamental flourishes 
instead, to the delight of both parries and sometimes of the onlookers as well. The student observes 
that there is a minimum number of moves essential to the program of the game, and these can be 
stated in the protocol. Individual players will embellish or multiply these basic moves according to 
their needs, talents or desires. The framework for IWFY is as follows: 
(1) Instruction-Compliance (""You stay home""—""All right""). 
(2) Instruction-Protest (""You stay home again""—""If it weren't for you""). 
Advantages. The general advantages of a game consist in its stabilizing (homeostatic) functions. 
Biological homeo-stasis is promoted by the stroking, and psychological stability is reinforced by 
the confirmation of position. As has already been noted, stroking may take various forms, so that 
the biological advantage of a game may be stated in tactile terms. Thus the husband's role in IWFY 
is reminiscent of a backhanded slap (quite different in effect from a palmar slap, which is a direct 
humiliation), and the wife's response is something like a petulant kick in the shins. Hence the 
biological gain from IWFY is derived from the belligerence-petulance exchanges: a distressing but 
apparently effective way to maintain the health of nervous tissues. 
Confirmation of the wife's position—""All men are tyrants"" —is the existential advantage. This 
position is a reaction to the need to surrender that is inherent in the phobias, a demonstration of the 
coherent structure which underlies all games. The expanded statement would be: ""If I went out 
alone in a crowd, I would be overcome by the temptation to surrender; at home I don't surrender: he 
forces me, which proves that all men are tyrants."" Hence this game is commonly played by women 
who suffer from feelings of unreality, which signifies their difficulty in keeping the Adult in charge 
in situations of strong temptation. The detailed elucidation of these mechanisms belongs to 
psychoanalysis rather than game analysis. In game analysis the end product is the chief concern. 
Internal psychological advantage of a game is its direct effect on the psychic economy (libido). In 
IWFY the socially acceptable surrender to the husband's authority keeps the woman from 
experiencing neurotic fears. At the same time it satisfies masochistic needs, if they exist, using 
masochism not in the sense of self-abnegation but with its classical meaning of sexual excitement 
in situations of deprivation, humiliation or pain. That is, it excites her to be deprived and dominated. 
External psychological advantage is the avoidance of the feared situation by playing the game. This 
is especially obvious in IWFY, where it is the outstanding motivation: by complying with the 
husband's strictures, the wife avoids the public situations which she fears. 
Internal social advantage is designed by the name of the game as it is played in the individual's 
intimate circle. By her compliance, the wife gains the privilege of saying ""If it weren't for you."" 
This helps to structure the time she must spend with her husband; in the case of Mrs. White, this 
need for structure was especially strong because of the lack of other common interests, especially 
before the arrival of their offspring and after the children were grown. In between, the game was 
played less intensively and less frequently, because the children performed their usual function of 
structuring time for their parents, and also provided an even more widely accepted version of 
IWFY, the busy-housewife variation. The fact that young mothers in America often really are very 
busy does not change the analysis of this variation. Game analysis only attempts to answer this 
question without prejudice: given that a young woman is busy, how does she go about exploiting 
her busyness in order to get some compensation for it? 
External social advantage is designated by the use made of the situation in outside social contacts. 
In the case of the game ""If It Weren't For You,"" which is what the wife says to her husband, there is 
a transformation into the pastime ""If It Weren't For Him"" when she meets with her friends over 
morning coffee. Again, the influence of games in the selection of social companions is shown. The 

23

 
new neighbor who is invited for morning coffee is being invited to play ""If It Weren't For Him."" If 
she plays, well and good, she will soon be a bosom friend of the old-timers, other things being 
equal. If she refuses to play and insists on taking a charitable view of her husband, she will not last 
long. Her situation will be the same as if she kept refusing to drink at cocktail parties—in most 
circles, she would gradually be dropped from the guest lists. 
This completes the analysis of the formal features of IWFY. In order to clarify the procedure 
further, the analysis of ""Why Don't You—Yes But,"" which is the most common game played at 
social gatherings, committee meetings and psychotherapy groups the world over, should be 
consulted (page 115). 

3 THE GENESIS OF GAMES 
From the present point of view, child rearing may be regarded as an educational process in which 
the child is taught what games to play and how to play diem. He is also taught procedures, rituals 
and pastimes appropriate to his position in the local social situation, but these are less significant. 
His knowledge of and skill in procedures, rituals and pastimes determine what opportunities will be 
available to him, other things being equal; but his games determine the use he will make of those 
opportunities, and the outcomes of situations for which he is eligible. As elements of his script, or 
unconscious life-plan, his favored games also determine his ultimate destiny (again with other 
things being equal): the payoffs on his marriage and career, and the circumstances surrounding his 
death. 
While conscientious parents devote a great deal of attention to teaching their children procedures, 
rituals and pastimes appropriate to their stations in life, and with equal care select schools, colleges 
and churches where their teachings will be reinforced, they tend to overlook the question of games, 
which form the basic structure for the emotional dynamics of each family, and which the children 
learn through significant experiences in everyday living from their earliest months. Related 
questions have been discussed for thousands of years in a rather general, unsystematic fashion, and 
there has been some attempt at a more methodical approach in the modern orthopsychiatric 
literature; but without the concept of games there is little possibility of a consistent investigation. 
Theories of internal individual psychodynamics have so far not been able to solve satisfactorily the 
problems of human relationships. These are transactional situations which call for a theory of social 
dynamics that cannot be derived solely from consideration of individual motivations. 
Since there are as yet few well-trained specialists in child psychology and child psychiatry who are 
also trained in game analysis, observations on the genesis of games are sparse. Fortunately, the 
following episode took place in the presence of a well-educated transactional analyst. 
Tanjy, age 7, got a stomach-ache at the dinner table and asked to be excused for that reason. His 
parents suggested that he lie down for a while. His little brother Mike, age 3, then said, ""I have a 
stomach-ache too,"" evidently angling for the same consideration. The father looked at him for a few 
seconds and then replied, ""You don't want to play that game, do you?"" Whereupon Mike burst out 
laughing and said, ""No!"" 
If this had been a household of food or bowel faddists, Mike would also have been packed off to 
bed by his alarmed parents. If he and they had repeated this performance several times, it might be 
anticipated that this game would have become part of Mike's character, as it so often does if the 
parents cooperate. Whenever he was jealous of a privilege granted to a competitor, he would plead 
illness in order to get some privileges himself. The ulterior transaction would then consist of: 
(social level) ""I don't feel well"" + (psychological level) ""You must grant me a privilege, too."" Mike, 
however, was saver from such a hypochondriacal career. Perhaps he will end up with a worse fate, 
but that is not the issue. The issue is that a game in statu nascendi was broken right there by the 
father's question and by the boy's frank acknowledgment that what he proposed was a game. 
This demonstrates clearly enough that games are quite deliberately initiated by young children. 
After they become fixed patterns of stimulus and response, their origins become lost in the mists of 
time and their ulterior nature becomes obscured by social fogs. Both can be brought into awareness 
only by appropriate procedures: the origin by some form of analytic therapy and the ulterior aspect 

24

 
by antithesis. Repeated clinical experience along these lines makes it clear that games are imitative 
in nature, and that they are initially set up by the Adult (neopsychic) aspect of the child's 
personality. If the Child ego state can be revived in the grown-up player, the psychological aptitude 
of this segment (the Adult aspect of the Child ego state) is so striking, and its skill in manipulating 
people so enviable, that it is colloquially called ""The Professor"" (of Psychiatry). Hence in 
psychotherapy groups which concentrate on game analysis, one of the more sophisticated 
procedures is the search for the little ""Professor"" in each patient, whose early adventures in setting 
up games between the ages of two and eight are listened to by everyone present with fascination 
and often, unless the games are tragic, with enjoyment and even hilarity, in which the patient 
himself may join with justifiable self-appreciation and smugness. Once he is able to do that, he is 
well on his way to relinquishing what may be an unfortunate behavior pattern which he is much 
better off without. 
Those are the reasons why in the formal description of a game an attempt is always made to 
describe the infantile or childhood prototype. 

4 THE FUNCTION OF GAMES 
Because there is so little opportunity for intimacy in daily life, and because some forms of intimacy 
(especially if intense) are psychologically impossible for most people, the bulk of the time in 
serious social life is taken up with playing games. Hence games are both necessary and desirable, 
and the only problem at issue is whether the games played by an individual offer the best yield for 
him. In this connection it should be remembered that the essential feature of a game is its 
culmination, or payoff. The principal function of the preliminary moves is to set up the situation for 
this payoff, but they are always designed to harvest the maximum permissible satisfaction at each 
step as a secondary product. Thus in ""Schlemiel"" (making messes and then apologizing) the payoff, 
and the purpose of the game, is to obtain the forgiveness which is forced by the apology; the 
spillings and cigarette burns are only steps leading up to this, but each such trespass yields its own 
pleasure. The enjoyment derived from the spilling does not make spilling a game. The apology is 
the critical stimulus that leads to the denouement. Otherwise the spilling would simply be a 
destructive procedure, a delinquency perhaps enjoyable. 
The game of ""Alcoholic"" is similar: whatever the physiological origin, if any, of the need to drink, 
in terms of game analysis the imbibing is merely a move in a game which is carried on with the 
people in the environment. The drinking may bring its own kinds of pleasure, but it is not the 
essence of the game. This is demonstrated in the variant of ""Dry Alcoholic,"" which involves the 
same moves and leads to the same payoff as the regular game, but is played without any bottles. 
Beyond their social function in structuring time satisfactorily, some games are urgently necessary 
for the maintenance of health in certain individuals. These people's psychic stability is so 
precarious, and their positions are so tenuously maintained, that to deprive them of their games may 
plunge them into irreversible despair and even psychosis. Such people will fight very hard against 
any antithetical moves. This is often observed in marital situations when the psychiatric 
improvement of one spouse (i-e., the abandonment of destructive games) leads to rapid 
deterioration in the other spouse, to whom the games were of paramount importance in maintaining 
equilibrium. Hence it is necessary to exercise prudence in game analysis. 
Fortunately, the rewards of game-free intimacy, which is or should be the most perfect form of 
human living, are so great that even precariously balanced personalities can safely and joyfully 
relinquish their games if an appropriate partner can be found for the better relationship. 
On a larger scale, games are integral and dynamic components of the unconscious life-plan, or 
script, of each individual; they serve to fill in the time while he waits for the final fulfillment, 
simultaneously advancing the action. Since the last act of a script characteristically calls for either a 
miracle or a catastrophe, depending on whether the script is constructive or destructive, the 
corresponding games ate accordingly either constructive or destructive. In colloquial terms, an 
individual whose script is oriented toward ""waiting for Santa Claus"" is likely to be pleasant to deal 
with in such games as ""Gee You're Wonderful, Mr. Murgatroyd,"" while someone with a tragic 

25

 
script oriented toward ""waiting for rigor mortis to set in"" may play such disagreeable games as 
""Now I've Got You, You Son of a Bitch."" 
It should be noted that colloquialisms such as those in the previous sentence are an integral part of 
game analysis, and are freely used in transactional psychotherapy groups and seminars. The 
expression ""waiting for rigor mortis to set in"" originated in a dream of a patient, in which she 
decided to get certain things done ""before rigor mortis set in."" A patient in a sophisticated group 
pointed out what the therapist had overlooked: that in practice, waiting for Santa Claus and waiting 
for death are synonymous. Since colloquialisms are of decisive importance in game analysis, they 
will be discussed at length later on. 

5 THE CLASSIFICATION OF GAMES  
Most of the variables used in analyzing games and pastimes have already been mentioned, and any 
of them can be used in classifying games and pastimes systematically. Some of the more obvious 
classifications are based on the following factors: 
1. Number of players: two-handed games (Frigid Woman), three-handed games (Let's You and 
Him Fight), five-handed games (Alcoholic) and many-handed games (Why Don't You-Yes But). 
2. Currency used: words (Psychiatry), money (Debtor), parts of the body (Polysurgery). 
3. Clinical types: hysterical (Rapo), obsessive-compulsive (Schlemiel), paranoid (Why Does This 
Have to Happen to Me), depressive (There I Go Again). 
4. Zonal: oral (Alcoholic), anal (Schlemiel), phallic (Let's You and Him Fight). 
5. Psychodynamic: counterphobic (If It Weren't for You), projective (PTA), introjective 
(Psychiatry). 
6. Instinctual: masochistic (If It Weren't for You), sadistic (Schlemiel), fetishistic (Frigid Man). 
In addition to the number of players, three other quantitative variables are often useful to consider: 
1. Flexibility. Some games, such as Debtor and Poly-surgery, can be played properly with only one 
kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible. 
2. Tenacity. Some people give up their games easily, others are persistent. 
3. Intensity. Some people play their games in a relaxed way, others are more tense and aggressive. 
Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively. 
These three variables converge to make games gentle or violent. In mentally disturbed people, there 
is often a noticeable progression in this respect, so that one can speak of stages. A paranoid 
schizophrenic may initially play a flexible, loose, easy game of first-stage ""Ain't It Awful"" and 
progress to an inflexible, tenacious, hard third stage. The stages in a game are distinguished as 
follows: 
a. A First-Degree Game is one which is socially acceptable in the agent's circle. 
b. A Second-Degree Game is one from which no permanent, irremediable damage arises, but which 
the players would rather conceal from the public. 
c. A Third-Degree Game is one which is played for keeps, and which ends in the surgery, the 
courtroom or the morgue. 
Games can also be classified according to any of the other specific factors discussed in the analysis 
of IWFY: the aims, the roles, the most obvious advantages. The most likely candidate For a 
systematic, scientific classification is probably one based on the existential position; but since 
knowledge of this factor is not yet sufficiently advanced, such a classification will have to be 
postponed. Failing that, the most practical classification at present is probably a sociological one. 
That is what will be used in the next section. 

NOTES 
Due credit should be given to Stephen Potter for his perceptive, humorous discussions of 
maneuvers, or ""ploys,"" in everyday social situations^ and to G. H. Mead for his pioneering study of 
the role of games in social living.3 Those games that lead to psychiatric disabilities have been 
systematically studied at the San Francisco Social Psychiatry Seminars since 1958, and this sector 

26

 
 
of game analysis has recently been approached by T. Szasz.4 For the role of games in the group 
process, die present writer's book on group dynamics should be consulted.*

PART II 
A Thesaurus of Games 

Introduction 
THIS collection is complete to date (1962), but new games are continually being discovered. 
Sometimes what appears to be another example of a known game turns out, on more careful study, 
to be an entirely new one, and a game which appears to be new often turns out to be a variation of a 
known one. The individual items of the analyses are also subject to change as new knowledge 
accumulates; for example, where there are several possible choices in describing dynamics, the 
statement given may turn out later not to have been the most cogent one. Both the list of games and 
the items given in the analyses, however, are adequate for clinical work. 
Some of the games are discussed and analyzed in extenso. Others, which require more investigation, 
or are uncommon, or whose significance is fairly obvious, are only briefly mentioned. The one who 
is ""it"" is generally referred to as the ""agent,"" or is given the name of ""White,"" while the other party 
is called ""Black."" 
The games are classified into families according to the situations in which they most commonly 
occur: Life Games, Marital Games, Party Games, Sexual Games and Underworld Games; then 
comes a section for professionals on Consulting Room Games, and finally, some examples of Good 
Games. 

1 NOTATION 
The following notation will be used in the analytic protocols. 
Title: If the game has a long name, a convenient abbreviation is used in the text. Where a game or 
its variations has more than one name, a cross reference will be found in the Index of Games. In 
oral reports it is preferable to use the full name of the game rather than its abbreviation or acronym. 
Thesis: this is restated as cogently as possible. 
Aim: this gives the most meaningful choice, based on die writer's experience. 
Roles: the role of the one who is ""it,"" and from whose point of view the game is discussed, is given 
first, in italics. 
Dynamics: as with aim. 
Examples: (1) this gives an illustration of the game as played in childhood, the most easily 
recognizable pertinent prototype. (2) an illustration from adult life. 
Paradigm: this illustrates as briefly as possible the critical transaction or transactions at the social 
and psychological levels. 
Moves: this gives the minimum number of transactional stimuli and transactional responses as 
found in practice. These may be expanded, diluted or ornamented to an unlimited extent in different 
situations. 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—this attempts to state how the game contributes to internal 
psychic stability. (2) External Psychological—this attempts to state what anxiety-arousing 
situations or intimacies are being avoided. (3) Internal Social—this gives the characteristic phrase 
used in the game as played with intimates. (4) External Social—this gives the key phrase used in 
the derivative game or pastime played in less intimate circles. 
(5) Biological—this attempts to characterize the kind of stroking which the game offers to the 
parties involved. 
(6) Existential—this states the position from which the game is typically played. 
Relatives: this gives the names of complementary, allied and antithetical games. 
An adequate understanding of a game can only be obtained in the psychotherapeutic situation. 
People who play destructive games will come to the therapist far more frequently than people who 
play constructive ones. Therefore most of the games which are well understood are basically 

28

 
destructive, but the reader should remember that there are constructive ones played by more 
fortunate people. 
And to prevent the idea of games from becoming vulgarized, as so many psychiatric terms are, it 
should be emphasized once more that it is a very precise idea: games should be clearly 
distinguished, by the criteria given previously, from procedures, rituals, pastimes, operations, 
maneuvers and the attitudes which arise from various positions. A game is played from a position, 
but a position or its corresponding attitude is not a game. 

2 COLLOQUIALISMS 
Many colloquialisms used here were supplied by patients. All of them, if used with due regard to 
timing and sensibilities, are appreciated, understood and enjoyed by the players. If some of them 
seem disrespectful, the irony is directed against the games and not against the people who play 
them. The first requirement for colloquialisms is aptness, and if they often sound amusing, that is 
precisely because they hit the nail on the head. As I have tried to show elsewhere in discussing 
colloquial epithets, a whole page of learned polysyllables may not convey as much as the statement 
that a certain woman is a bitch, or that a certain man is a jerk.1 Psychological truths may be stated 
for academic purposes in scientific language, but the effective recognition of emotional strivings in 
practice may require a different approach. So we prefer playing ""Ain't It Awful"" to ""verbalizing 
projected anal aggression."" The former not only has a more dynamic meaning and impact, but it is 
actually more precise. And sometimes people get better faster in bright rooms than diey do in drab 
ones.

CHAPTER SIX 
Life Games 
ALL games have an important and probably decisive influence on the destinies of the players under 
ordinary social conditions; but some offer more opportunities than others for lifelong careers and 
are more likely to involve relatively innocent bystanders. This group may be conveniently called 
Life Games. It includes ""Alcoholic,"" ""Debtor,"" ""Kick Me,"" ""Now I've Got You, You Son of a 
Bitch,"" ""See What You Made Me Do"" and their principal variants. They merge on the one side with 
marital games, and on the other with those of the underworld. 

1 ALCOHOLIC 
Thesis. In game analysis there is no such thing as alcoholism or ""an alcoholic,"" but there is a role 
called the Alcoholic in a certain type of game. If a biochemical or physiological abnormality is the 
prim^ mover in excessive drinking-and that is still open to some question - then its study belongs in 
the field of internal medicine. Game analysis is interested in something quite different—the kinds 
of social transactions that are related to such excesses. Hence the game ""Alcoholic."" 
In its full flower this is a five-handed game, although the roles may be condensed so that it starts 
off and terminates as a two-handed one. The central role is that of the Alcoholic—the one who is 
""it""—played by White. The chief supporting role is that of Persecutor, typically played by a 
member of the opposite sex, usually the spouse. The third role is that of Rescuer, usually played by 
someone of the same sex, often the good family doctor who is interested in the patient and also in 
drinking, problems. In the classical situation the doctor successfully rescues the alcoholic from his 
habit. After White has not taken a drink for six months they congratulate each other. The following 
day White is found in the gutter. 
The fourth role is that of the Patsy, or Dummy. In literature this is played by the delicatessen man 
who extends credit to White, gives him a sandwich on the curt and perhaps a cup of coffee, without 
either persecuting him or trying to rescue him. In life this is more frequently played by White's 
mother, who gives him money and often sympathizes with him about the wife who does not 
understand him. In this aspect of the game, White is required to account in some plausible way for 
his need for money—by some project in which both pretend to believe, although they know what 
he is really going to spend most of the money for. Sometimes the Patsy slides over into another role, 
which is a helpful but not essential one: the Agitator, the ""good guy"" who offers supplies without 
even being asked for them: ""Come have a drink with me (and you will go downhill faster)."" 
The ancillary professional in all drinking games is the bartender or liquor clerk. In the game 
""Alcoholic"" he plays the fifth role, the Connection, the direct source of supply who also 
understands alcoholic talk, and who in a way is the most meaningful person in the life of any addict. 
The difference between the Connection and the other players is the difference between 
professionals and amateurs in any game: the professional knows when to stop. At a certain point a 
good bartender refuses to serve the Alcoholic, who is then left without any supplies unless he can 
locate a more indulgent Connection. 
In the initial stages of ""Alcoholic,"" the wife may play all three supporting roles: at midnight the 
Patsy, undressing him, making him coffee and letting him beat up on her; in the morning the 
Persecutor, berating him for the evil of his ways; and in the evening the Rescuer, pleading with him 
to change them. In the later stages, due sometimes to organic deterioration, the Persecutor and the 
Rescuer can be dispensed with, but are tolerated if they are also wilting to act as sources of supply. 
White will go to the Mission House and be rescued if he can get a free meal there; or be will stand 
for a scolding, amateur or professional, as long as he can get a handout afterward. 
Present experience indicates that the payoff in ""Alcoholic"" (as is characteristic of games in general) 
comes from the aspect to which most investigators pay least attention. In the analysis of this game, 
drinking itself is merely an incidental pleasure having added advantages, the procedure leading up 
to the culmination, which is the hangover. It is the same in the game of Schlemiel: the mess-making, 

30

 
which attracts the most attention, is merely a pleasure-giving way for White to lead up to the crux, 
which is obtaining forgiveness from Black. 
For the Alcoholic the hangover is not as much the physical pain as the psychological torment. The 
two favorite pastimes of drinking people are ""Martini"" (how many drinks and how they were mixed) 
and ""Morning After"" (Let me tell you about my hangover). ""Martini"" is played, for the most part, 
by social drinkers; many alcoholics prefer a hard round of psychological ""Morning After,"" and 
organizations such as A.A. offer him an unlimited opportunity for this. 
Whenever one patient visited his psychiatrist after a binge, he would call himself all sorts of names; 
the psychiatrist said nothing. Later, recounting these visits in a therapy group, White said with 
smug satisfaction that it was the psychiatrist who had called him all those names. The main 
conversational interest of many alcoholics in the therapeutic situation is not their drinking, which 
they apparently mention mostly in deference to their persecutors, but their subsequent suffering. 
The transactions! object of the drinking, aside from the personal pleasures it brings, is to set up a 
situation where the Child can be severely scolded not only by the internal Parent but by any 
parental figures in the environment who are interested enough to oblige. Hence the therapy of this 
game should be concentrated not on the drinking but on the morning after, the self-indulgence in 
self-castigation. There is a type of heavy drinker, however, who does not have hangovers, and such 
people do not belong in the present category. 
There is also a game ""Dry Alcoholic,"" in which White goes through the process of financial or 
social degradation without a bottle, making the same sequence of moves and requiring the same 
supporting cast. Here again, the morning after is the crux of the matter. Indeed, it is the similarity 
between ""Dry Alcoholic"" and regular ""Alcoholic"" which emphasizes that both are games; for 
example, the procedure for getting discharged from a job is the same in both. ""Addict"" is similar to 
""Alcoholic,"" but more sinister, more dramatic, more sensational and faster. In our society, at least, 
it leans more heavily on the readily available Persecutor, with Patsies and Rescuers being few and 
far between and the Connection playing a much more central role. 
There are a variety of organizations involved in ""Alcoholic,"" some of them national or even 
international in scope, others local. Many of them publish rules for the game. Nearly all of them 
explain how to play the role of Alcoholic: take a drink before breakfast, spend money allotted for 
other purposes, etc. They also explain the function of the Rescuer. Alcoholics Anonymous, for 
example, continues playing the actual game but concentrates on inducing the Alcoholic to take the 
role of Rescuer. Former Alcoholics are preferred because they know how the game goes, and hence 
are better qualified to play the supporting role than people who have never played before. Cases 
have been reported of a chapter of A.A. running out of Alcoholics to work on; whereupon the 
members resumed drinking since there was no other way to continue the game in the absence of 
people to rescue. 
There are also organizations devoted to improving the lot of the other players. Some put pressure 
on the spouses to shift their roles from Persecutor to Rescuer. The one which seems to come closest 
to the theoretical ideal of treatment deals with teen-age offspring of alcoholics; these young people 
are encouraged to break away from the game itself, rather than merely shift their roles. 
The psychological cure of an alcoholic also lies in getting him to stop playing the game altogether, 
rather than simply change from one role to another. In some cases this has been feasible, although it 
is a difficult task to find something else as interesting to the Alcoholic as continuing his game. 
Since he is classically afraid of intimacy, the substitute may have to be another game rather than a 
game-free relationship. Often so-called cured alcoholics are not very stimulating company socially, 
and possibly they feel a lack of excitement in their lives and are continually tempted to go back to 
their old ways. The criterion of a true ""game cure"" is that the former Alcoholic should be able to 
drink socially without putting himself in jeopardy. The usual ""total abstinence"" cure will not satisfy 
the game analyst. 
It is apparent from the description of this game that there is a strong temptation for the Rescuer to 
play ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"": for the Persecutor to play ""Look What You've Done to Me""; 
and for the Patsy to play ""Good Joe."" With the rise of rescue organizations which publicize the idea 

31

 
that alcoholism is a disease, alcoholics have been taught to play ""Wooden Leg."" The law, which 
takes a special interest in such people, tends to encourage this nowadays- The emphasis has shifted 
from the Persecutor to the Rescuer, from ""I am a sinner"" to ""What do you expect from a sick 
mane1"" (part of the trend in modern thinking away from religion and toward science). From an 
existential point of view the shift is questionable, and from a practical point of view it seems to 
have done little to diminish the sale of liquor to heavy 
*In the underworld slang ""patsy"" once meant all right, or satisfactory, and later came to denote a 
""pigeon"" drinkers. Nevertheless, Alcoholics Anonymous is still for most people the best initiation 
into the therapy of over-indulgence. 
Antithesis. As is well known, ""Alcoholic"" is usually played hard and is difficult to give up. In one 
case a female alcoholic in a therapy group participated very little until she thought she knew 
enough about the other members to go ahead with her game. She then asked them to tell her what 
they thought of her. Since she had behaved pleasantly enough, various members said nice things 
about her, but she protested: ""That's not what I want. I want to know what you really think."" She 
made it clear that she was seeking derogatory comments. The other women refused to persecute her, 
whereupon she went home and told her husband that if she took another drink, he must either 
divorce her or send her to a hospital. He promised to do this, and that evening she became 
intoxicated and he sent her to a sanitarium. Here the other members refused to play the persecutory 
roles White assigned to them; she was unable to tolerate this antithetical behavior, in spite of 
everyone's efforts to reinforce whatever insight she had already obtained. At home she found 
someone who was willing to play the role she demanded. 
In other cases, however, it appears possible to prepare the patient sufficiently so that the game can 
be given up, and to attempt a true social cure in which the therapist declines to play either 
Persecutor or Rescuer. It is equally untherapeutic for him to play the role of Patsy by allowing the 
patient to forego his financial and punctuality obligations. The correct therapeutic procedure from a 
transactional point of view is, after careful preliminary groundwork, to take an Adult contractual 
position and refuse to play any of the roles, hoping that the patient will be able to tolerate not only 
abstinence from drinking but also from playing his game. If he cannot, he is best referred to a 
Rescuer. 
Antithesis is particularly difficult, because the heavy drinker is highly regarded in most Western 
countries as a desirable object for censure, concern or generosity, and someone who refuses to play 
any of these roles tends to arouse public indignation. A rational approach may be even more 
alarming to the Rescuers than to the Alcoholic, sometimes with unfortunate consequences to the 
therapy. In one clinical situation a group of workers were seriously interested in the game 
""Alcoholic"" and were attempting to effect real cures by breaking up the game rather than merely 
rescuing the patients. As soon as this became apparent, they were frozen out by the lay committee 
which was backing the clinic, and none of them was ever again called on to assist in treating these 
patients. 
Relatives. An interesting byplay in ""Alcoholic"" is called ""Have One."" This was discovered by a 
perceptive student of industrial psychiatry. White and his wife (a non-drinking Persecutor) go on a 
picnic with Black and his wife (both Patsies). White says to the Blacks, ""Have one!"" If they have 
one, this gives White license to have four or five. The game is unmasked if the Blacks refuse. 
White, by the rules of drinking, is then entitled to be insulted, and he will find more compliant 
companions for his next picnic. What appears at the social level to be Adult generosity, is at the 
psychological level an act of insolence, whereby White's Child obtains Parental indulgence from 
Black by open bribery under the very nose of Mrs. White, who is powerless to protest. Actually it is 
just because she will be ""powerless"" to protest dial Mrs. White consents to the whole arrangement, 
since she is just as anxious for the game to continue, with herself in the role of Persecutor, as Mr. 
White is with himself in the role of Alcoholic, Her recriminations against him in the morning after 
die picnic are easy to imagine. This variant can cause complications if White is Black's boss. 
In general the Patsy is not as badly off as the name implies. Patsies are often lonely people who 
have a great deal to gain by being nice to Alcoholics. The delicatessen man who plays ""Good Joe"" 

32

 
makes many acquaintances in this way, and he can get a good reputation in his own social circle 
not only as a generous person but also as a good storyteller. 
One variant of ""Good Joe,"" incidentally, is to go around asking for advice about how best to help 
people. This is an example of a jolly and constructive game worth encouraging. Its inverse is Tough 
Guy, taking lessons in violence or asking for advice about how best to hurt people. Although the 
mayhem is never put into practice, the player has the privilege of associating with real tough guys 
who are playing for keeps, and can bask in their reflected glory. This is one species of what the 
French call un fanfaron de vice. 

ANALYSIS 
Thesis: How bad I've been; see if you can stop me. Aim: Self-castigation. 
Roles: Alcoholic, Persecutor, Rescuer, Patsy, Connection. Dynamics: Oral deprivation. 
Examples: (1) See if you can catch me. The prototypes of this game are difficult to correlate 
because of its complexity. Children, however, particularly children of alcoholics, often go through 
many of the maneuvers characteristic of the Alcoholic. ""See if you can stop me,"" which involves 
lying, hiding things, seeking derogatory comments, looking for helpful people, finding a benevolent 
neighbor who will give free handouts, etc. Self-castigation is often postponed to later years.  
(2) The alcoholic and his circle, Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. 
Adult: ""Tell me what you really think of me or help me stop drinking."" 
Adult: ""I'll be frank with you."" Psychological Paradigm: Parent-Child. Child: ""See if you can stop 
me."" Parent: ""You must stop drinking because. . . .""  
Moves: (1) Provocation—accusation or forgiveness. (2) Indulgence—anger or disappointment. 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—(a) Drinking as a procedure—rebellion, reassurance and 
satisfaction of craving. (b) ""Alcoholic"" as a game—self-castigation (probable). (2) External 
Psychological—avoidance of sexual and other forms of intimacy. (3) Internal Social—See if you 
can stop me. (4) External Social—""Morning After,"" ""Martini,"" and other pastimes. (5) Biological—
alternating loving and angry exchanges. (6) Existential—Everybody wants to deprive m, 

2 DEBTOR 
Thesis. ""Debtor"" is more than a game. In America it tends to become a script, a plan for a whole 
lifetime, just as it does in some of the jungles of Africa and New Guinea.2 There the relatives of a 
young man buy him a bride at an enormous price, putting him in their debt for years to come. Here 
die same custom prevails, at least in the more civilized sections of the country, except that the bride 
price becomes a house price, and if there is no stake from the relatives, this role is taken on by the 
bank. Thus the young man in New Guinea with an old wrist watch dangling from his ear to ensure 
success, and the young man in America with a new wrist watch wrapped around his arm to ensure 
success, both feel that they have a ""purpose"" in life. The big celebration, the wedding or 
housewarming, takes place not when the debt is discharged, but when it is undertaken. What is 
emphasized on TV, for example, is not the middle-aged man who has finally paid off his mortgage, 
but the young man who moves into his new home with his family, proudly waving the papers he 
has just signed and which will bind him for most of his productive years. After he has paid his 
debts—the mortgage, the college expenses for his children and his insurance—he is regarded as a 
problem, a ""senior citizen"" for whom society must provide not only material comforts but a new 
""purpose."" As in New Guinea, if he is very shrewd, he may become a big creditor instead of a big 
debtor, but this happens relatively rarely. 
As this is written, a sow bug crawls across a desk. If he is turned over on his back, one can observe 
the tremendous struggle he goes through to get on his feet again. During this interval he has a 
""purpose"" in his life. When he succeeds, one can almost see the look of victory on his face. Off he 
goes, and one can imagine him telling his tale at the next meeting of sow bugs, looked up to by the 
younger generation as an insect who has made it. And yet mixed with his smugness is a little 
disappointment. Now that he has come out on top, life seems aimless. Maybe he will return in the 

33

 
 
 
hope of repeating his triumph. It might be worth marking his back with ink, so as to recognize him 
if he risks it. A courageous animal, the sow bug. No wonder he has survived for millions of years. 
Most young Americans, however, take their mortgages very seriously only in times of stress. If 
they are depressed, or the economic situation is bad, their obligations keep them going -and may 
prevent some of them from committing suicide. Most of the time they play a mild game of ""If It 
Weren't for the Debts,"" but otherwise enjoy themselves. Only a few make a career out of playing a 
hard game of ""Debtor,"" 
""Try and Collect"" (TAG) is commonly played by young married couples, and illustrates how a 
game is set up so that the player ""wins"" whichever way it goes. The Whites obtain all sorts of goods 
and services on credit, petty or luxurious, depending on their backgrounds and how they were 
taught to play by their parents or grandparents. If the creditor gives up after a few soft efforts to 
collect, then the Whites can enjoy their gains without penalty, and in this sense they win. If the 
creditor makes more strenuous attempts, then they enjoy the pleasures of the chase as well as the 
use of their purchases. The hard form of the game occurs if the creditor is determined to collect. In 
order to get his money he will have to resort to extreme measures. These usually have a coercive 
element—going to White's employers or driving up to his house in a noisy, garish truck labeled in 
big letters COLLECTION AGENCY. 
At this point there is a switch. White now knows that he will probably have to pay. But because of 
the coercive element, made clear in most cases by the ""third letter"" from the collector (""If you do 
not appear at our office within 48 hours. . . .""), White feels peremptorily justified in getting angry; 
he now switches over to a variant of ""Now I've Got You, You Son of a Bitch."" In this case he wins 
by demonstrating that the creditor is greedy, ruthless and untrustworthy. The two most obvious 
advantages of this are (1) it strengthens White's existential position, which is a disguised form of 
""All creditors are grasping,"" and (2) it offers a large external social gain, since he is now in a 
position to abuse the creditor openly to his friends without losing his own status as a ""Good Joe."" 
He may also exploit further internal social gain by confronting the creditor himself. In addition, it 
vindicates his taking advantage of the credit system: if that is the way creditors are, as he has now 
shown, why pay anybody? 
""Creditor,"" in the form ""Try and Get Away With It"" (TAGAWI), is sometimes played by small 
landlords. TAG and TAGAWI players readily recognize each other, and because of the prospective 
transactional advantages and the promised sport, they are secretly pleased and readily become 
involved with each other. Regardless of who wins the money, each has improved the other's 
position for playing ""Why Does This Always Happen To Me?"" after it is all over. 
Money games can have very serious consequences. If these descriptions sound facetious, as they do 
to some people, it is not because they relate to trivia but because of the exposure of trivial 
motivations behind matters people are taught to take seriously. 
Antithesis. The obvious antithesis of TAG is to request immediate payment in cash. But a good 
TAG player has methods for getting around that, which will work on any but the most hard-boiled 
creditors. The antithesis of TAGAWI is promptness and honesty. Since hard TAG and TAGAWI 
players are both professionals in every sense of die word, an amateur stands as much chance 
playing against them as he does playing against professional gamblers. While the amateur seldom 
wins, he can at least enjoy himself if he becomes involved in one of these games. Since both are by 
tradition played grimly, nothing is more disconcerting to the professionals than to have an amateur 
victim laugh at the outcome. In financial circles this is considered strictly Out. In the cases reported 
to this writer, laughing at a debtor when one encounters him on the street is just as bewildering, 
frustrating and disconcerting to him as playing anti-""Schlemiel"" is to a Schlemiel. 

3 KICK ME 
Thesis. This is played by men whose social manner is equivalent to wearing a sign that reads 
""Please Don't Kick Me."" The temptation is almost irresistible, and when the natural result follows, 
White cries piteously, ""But the sign says 'don't kick me.'"" Then he adds incredulously, ""Why does 
this always happen to me?"" (WAHM.) Clinically, the WAHM may be introjected and disguised in 

34

 
the ""Psychiatry"" cliche"": ""Whenever I'm under stress, I get all shook up."" One game element in 
WAHM comes from inverse pride: ""My misfortunes are better than yours."" This factor is often 
found in paranoids. 
If the people in his environment are restrained from striking at him by kindheartedness, ""I'm Only 
Trying to Help You,"" social convention or organizational rules, his behavior becomes more and 
more provocative until he transgresses the limits and forces them to oblige. These are men who are 
cast out, the jilted and the job losers. 
The corresponding game among women is ""Threadbare.1 Often genteel, they take pains to be 
shabby. They see to it that their earnings, for ""good"" reasons, never rise much above the subsistence 
level. If they have a windfall, there are always enterprising young men who will help them get rid 
of it, giving them in return shares in a worthless business promotion or something equivalent. 
Colloquially, such a woman is called ""Mother's Friend,"" always ready to give judicious Parental 
advice and living vicariously on the experience of others. Their WAHM is a silent one, and only 
(heir demeanor of brave struggle suggests ""Why does this always happen to me?"" 
An interesting form of WAHM occurs in well-adapted people who reap increasing rewards and 
successes, often beyond their own expectations. Here the WAHM may lead to serious and 
constructive thinking, and to personal growth in the best sense, if it takes the form ""What did I 
really do to deserve this?"" 

4 NOW I'VE GOT YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH 
Thesis. This can be seen in classic form in poker games. White gets an unbeatable hand, such as 
four aces. At this point, if he is a NIGYSOB player, he is more interested in the fact that Black is 
completely at his mercy than he is in good poker or making money- 
White needed some plumbing fixtures installed, and he reviewed the costs very carefully with the 
plumber before giving him a go-ahead. The price was set, and it was agreed that there would be no 
extras. When the plumber submitted his bill, he included a few dollars extra for an unexpected 
valve that had to be installed—about four dollars on a four-hundred-dollar job. White became 
infuriated, called the plumber on the phone and demanded an explanation. The plumber would not 
back down. White wrote him a long letter criticizing his integrity and ethics and refused to pay the 
bill until the extra charge was withdrawn. The plumber finally gave in. 
It soon became obvious that both White and the plumber were playing games. In the course of their 
negotiations, they bad recognized each other's potentials. The plumber made his provocative move 
when he submitted this bill. Since White had the plumber's word, the plumber was clearly in the 
wrong. White now felt justified in venting almost unlimited rage against Him. Instead of merely 
negotiating in a dignified way that befit the Adult standards he set for himself, perhaps with a little 
innocent annoyance, White took the opportunity to make extensive criticisms of the plumber's 
whole way of living. On the surface their argument was Adult to Adult, a legitimate business 
dispute over a stated sum of money. At the psychological level it was Parent to Adult: White was 
exploiting his trivial but socially defensible objection (position) to vent the pent-up furies of many 
years on his cozening opponent, just as his mother might have done in a similar situation. He 
quickly recognized his underlying attitude (NIGYSOB) and realized how secretly delighted he had 
been at the plumber's provocation. He then recalled that ever since early childhood he had looked 
for similar injustices, received diem with delight and exploited them with the same vigor. In many 
of the cases he recounted, he had forgotten the actual provocation, but remembered in great detail 
the course of the ensuing battle. The plumber, apparently, was playing some variation of ""Why 
Does This Always Happen to Me?"" (WAHM). 
NIGYSOB is a two-handed game which must be distinguished from ""Ain't It Awful?"" (AIA). In 
AIA the agent seeks injustices in order to complain about them to a third party, making a three-
handed game: Aggressor, Victim, Confidant. AIA is played under the slogan ""Misery Loves 
Company."" The confidant is usually someone who also plays AIA. WAHM is three-handed, too, 
but here the agent is trying to establish his pre-eminence in misfortune and resents competition 

35

 
 
from other unfortunates. NIGYSOB is commercialized in a three-handed professional form as the 
""badger game."" It may also be played as a two-handed marital game in more or less subtle forms. 
Antithesis. The best antithesis is correct behavior. The contractual structure of a relationship with a 
NIGYSOB player should be explicitly stated in detail at the first opportunity, and the rules strictly 
adhered to. In clinical practice, for example, the question of payment for missed appointments or 
cancellations must be settled clearly at once, and extra precautions must be taken to avoid mistakes 
in bookkeeping. If an unforeseen contretemps arises, the antithesis is to yield gracefully without 
dispute, until such time as the therapist is prepared to deal with the game. In everyday life, business 
dealings with NIGYSOB players are always calculated risks. The wife of such a person should be 
treated with polite correctness, and even the mildest flirtations, gallantries or slights should be 
avoided, especially if the husband himself seems to encourage them. 

ANALYSIS 
Thesis: Now I've got you, you son of a bitch. Aim: Justification. Roles: Victim, Aggressor. 
Dynamics: Jealous rage. 
Examples: (1) I caught you this time. (2) Jealous husband. 
Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. 
Adult: ""See, you have done wrong."" Adult: ""Now that you draw it to my attention, I guess I have."" 
Psychological Paradigm: Parent-Child. 
Parent: ""I've been watching you, hoping you'd make a slip."" 
Child: ""You caught me this time."" Parent: ""Yes, and I'm going to let you feel the full force of my 
fury."" 
Moves; (I) Provocation—Accusation. (2) Defense-Accusation. (3) Defense—Punishment. 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological-justification for rage. (2) External Psychological—avoids 
confrontation of own deficiencies. (3) Internal Social-NIGYSOB. (4) External Social—they're 
always out to get you. (5) Biological-belligerent exchanges, usually ipsisexual. (6) Existential—
people can't be trusted. 

5 SEE WHAT YOU MADE ME DO  
Thesis. In its classical form this is a marital game, and in fact is a ""three-star marriage buster,"" but 
it may also be played between parents and children and in working life. 
(1) First-Degree SWYMD: White, feeling unsociable, becomes engrossed in some activity which 
tends to insulate him against people. Perhaps all he wants at the moment is to be left alone. An 
intruder, such as his wife or one of his children, comes either for stroking or to ask him something 
like, ""Where can I find the long-nosed pliers?"" This interruption ""causes"" his chisel, paintbrush, 
typewriter or soldering iron to slip, whereupon he turns on the intruder in a rage and cries, ""See 
what you made me do."" As this is repeated through the years, his family tends more and more to 
leave him alone when he is engrossed. Of course it is not the intruder but his own irritation which 
""causes' the slip, and he is only too happy when it occurs, since it gives him a lever for ejecting the 
visitor. Unfortunately this is a game which is only too easily learned by young children, so that it is 
easily passed on from generation to generation. The underlying satisfaction and advantages are 
more clearly demonstrated when it is played more seductively. 
(2) Second-Degree SWYMD: If SWYMD is the basis for a way of life, rather than merely being 
used occasionally as a protective mechanism, White marries a woman who plays ""I'm Only Trying 
to Help You"" or one of its relatives. It is then easy for him to defer decisions to her. Often this may 
be done in the guise of considerateness or gallantry. He may deferentially and courteously let her 
decide where to go for dinner or which movie to see. If things cum out well, he can enjoy them. If 
not, he can blame her by saying or implying: ""You Got Me Into This,"" a simple variation of 
SWYMD. Or he may throw the burden of decisions regarding the children's upbringing on her, 
while he acts as executive officer; if the children get upset he can play a straight game of SWYMD. 
This lays the groundwork through the years. For blaming mother if the children turn out badly; then 

36

 
 
 
SWYMD is not an end in itself, but merely offers passing satisfaction on the way to ""I Told You 
So"" or ""See What You've Done Now."" 
The professional player who pays his psychological way with SWYMD will use it also in his work. 
In occupational SWYMD the long-suffering look of resentment replaces words. The player 
""democratically"" or as part of ""good management"" asks his assistants for suggestions. In this way 
he may attain an unassailable position for terrorizing his juniors. Any mistake he makes can be 
used against them by blaming them for it. Used against seniors (blaming them for one's mistakes), 
it becomes self-destructive and may lead to termination of employment or, in the army, to transfer 
to another unit. In that case it is a component of ""Why Does This Always Happen To Me?"" with 
resentful people, or of ""There I Go Again"" with depressives— (both of the ""Kick Me"" family). 
(3) Third-Degree SWYMD: in a hard form SWYMD may be played by paranoids against people 
incautious enough to give them advice (.see ""I'm Only Trying to Help You""). There it may be 
dangerous, and in rare cases even fatal. 
""See What You Made Me Do"" (SWYMD) and ""You Got Me Into This"" (UGMIT) complement 
each other nicely, so that the SWYMD-UGMIT combination is a classical basis for the covert game 
contract in many marriages. This contract is illustrated by the following sequence. 
By mutual agreement Mrs. White did the family bookkeeping and paid the bills out of the joint 
checking account because Mr. White was ""poor at figures."" Every few months they would be 
notified of an overdraft, and Mr. White would have to square it with the bank. When they looked 
for the source of the difficulty, it would turn out that Mrs. White had made an expensive purchase 
without telling her husband. When this came to light, Mr. White would furiously play his UGMIT, 
and she would tearfully accept his rebuke and promise it would not happen again. Everything 
would go smoothly for a while, and then a creditor's agent would suddenly appear to demand 
payment for a long-overdue bill. Mr. White, not having heard of this bill, would question his wife 
about it. She would then play her SWYMD, saying that it was his fault. Since he had forbidden her 
to overdraw their account, the only way she could make ends meet was by leaving this large 
obligation unpaid and hiding the duns from him. 
These games had been allowed to go on for ten years, on the basis that each occurrence would be 
the last, and that from then on it would be different—which it was, for a few months. In therapy Mr. 
White very cleverly analyzed this game without any assistance from the therapist, and also devised 
an effective remedy. By mutual agreement he and Mrs. White put all charge accounts and their 
bank account in his name. Mrs. White continued to do the bookkeeping and make out the checks, 
but Mr. White saw the hills first and controlled the outgoing payments. In this way neither duns nor 
overdrafts could get by him, and they now shared the budgetary labor. Deprived of die satisfactions 
and advantages of SWYMD-UGMIT, the Whites were at first at a loss, and were then driven to 
find more open and constructive types of gratification from each other. 
Antithesis. The antithesis to First-Degree SWYMD is to leave the player alone, and to Second-
Degree SWYMD to throw the decision back on White. The First-Degree player may react by 
feeling forlorn, but seldom angry; the Second-Degree player may become sulky if he is forced to 
take the initiative, so that systematic anti-SWYMD leads to disagreeable consequences. The 
antithesis to Third-Degree SWYMD should be put into competent professional hands. 

PARTIAL ANALYSIS 
The aim of this game is vindication. Dynamically the mild form may be related to premature 
ejaculation, the hard form to rage based on ""castration"" anxiety. It is easily acquired by children. 
The external psychological gain - avoidance of responsibility) is prominent, and the game is often 
precipitated by the threat of impending intimacy, since the ""justifiable"" anger offers a good excuse 
for avoiding sexual relations. The existential position is, ""I am blameless,""

CHAPTER SEVEN 
Marital Game 

ALMOST any game can form the scaffolding For married life and family living, but some, such as 
""IF It Weren't for You,"" flourish better or, like ""Frigid Woman,"" are tolerated longer, under the 
legal force of contractual intimacy. Marital games, of course, can only be arbitrarily separated from 
sexual games, which are treated is a separate section. Those games which characteristically evolve 
into their most full-blown forms in the marital relationship include ""Comer,"" ""Courtroom,"" ""Frigid 
Woman"" and ""Frigid Man,"" ""Harried,"" ""If It Weren't for You,"" ""Look How Hard I've Tried"" and 
""Sweetheart."" 

1 CORNER 
Thesis. Comer illustrates more clearly than most games their manipulative aspect and their function 
as barriers to intimacy. Paradoxically, it consists of a disingenuous refusal to play the game of 
another. 
1. Mrs. White suggests to her husband that they go to a movie. Mr. White agrees. 
2a. Mrs. White makes an ""unconscious"" slip. She mentions quite naturally in the course of 
conversation that the house needs painting. This is an expensive project, and White has recently 
told her that their finances are strained; he requested her not to embarrass or annoy him by 
suggesting unusual expenditures, at least until the beginning of the new month. This is therefore an 
ill-chosen moment to bring up the condition of the house, and White responds rudely. 
2b. Alternatively: White steers the conversation around to the house, making it difficult for Mrs. 
White to resist die temptation to say that it needs painting. As in the previous case, White responds 
rudely. 
3. Mrs. White takes offense and says that if he is in one of his bad moods, she will not go to die 
movie with him, and he had best go by himself. He says if that is die way she feels about it, he will 
go alone. 
4. White goes to die movie (or out with the boys), leaving Mrs. White at home to nurse her injured 
feelings. There are two possible gimmicks in this game: A. Mrs. White knows very well from past 
experience that she is not supposed to take his annoyance seriously. What he really wants is for her 
to show some appreciation of how hard he works to earn their living; then they could go off happily 
together. But she refuses to play, and he feels badly lei down. He leaves filled with disappointment 
and resentment, while she stays at home looking abused, but with a secret feeling of triumph. 
B. White knows very well from past experience that he is not supposed to take her pique seriously. 
What she really wants is to be honeyed out of it; then they would go off happily together. But he 
refuses to play, knowing that his refusal is dishonest: he knows she wants to be coaxed, but 
pretends he doesn't. He leaves the house, feeling cheerful and relieved, but looking wronged. She is 
left feeling disappointed and resentful. 
In each of these cases die winner's position is, from a naive standpoint, irreproachable; all he or she 
has done is take the other literally. This is clearer in (B), where White takes Mrs. White's refusal to 
go at face value. They both know that this is cheating, but since she said it, she is cornered. 
The most obvious gain here is die external psychological. Both of diem find movies sexually 
stimulating, and it is more or less anticipated that after they return from the theater, they will make 
love. Hence whichever one of them wants to avoid intimacy sets up the game in move (2a) or (2b). 
This is a particularly exasperating variety of ""Uproar"" (see Chapter 9). The ""wronged"" party can, of 
course, make a good case for not wanting to make love in a state of justifiable indignation, and the 
cornered spouse has no recourse. 
Antithesis. This is simple for Mrs. White. All she has to do is change her mind, take her husband 
by the arm, smile and go along with him (a shift from Child to Adult ego state). It is more difficult 
for Mr. White, since she now has die initiative; but if he reviews die whole situation, he may be 

39

 
 
able to coax her into going along with him, either as a sulky Child who has been placated or, better, 
as an Adult. 
""Comer"" is found in a somewhat different form as a family game involving the children, where it 
resembles the ""double-bind"" described by Bateson and his associates.1 Here the child is cornered, 
so that whatever he does is wrong. According to the Bateson school, this may be an important 
etiological factor in schizophrenia. In the present language, then, schizophrenia may be a child's 
antithesis to ""Corner."" Experience in treating adult schizophrenics with game analysis bears this 
out—that is, if the family game of ""Comer"" is analyzed to demonstrate that the schizophrenic 
behavior was and is specifically undertaken to counter this game, partial or total remission occurs 
in a properly prepared patient. 
An everyday form of ""Corner"" which is played by the whole family and is most likely to affect the 
character development of the younger children occurs with meddlesome ""Parental"" parents. The 
little boy or girl is urged to be more helpful around the house, but when he is, the parents find fault 
with what he does—a homely example of ""damned if you do and damned if you don't."" This 
""double-bind"" may be called the Dilemma Type of ""Corner."" 
""Corner"" is sometimes found as an etiological factor in asthmatic children. 
Little girl: ""Mommy, do you love me?"" Mother: ""What is love?"" 
This answer leaves the child with no direct recourse. She wants to talk about mother, and mother 
switches the subject to philosophy, which the little girl is not equipped to handle. She begins to 
breathe hard, mother is irritated, asthma sets in, mother apologizes and the ""Asthma Game"" now 
runs its course. This ""Asthma"" type of ""Corner"" remains to be studied further. 
An elegant variant, which may be called the ""Russell-Whitehead Type"" of ""Corner,"" sometimes 
occurs in therapy groups. 
Black: ""Well, anyway, when we're silent nobody is playing games."" 
White: ""Silence itself may be a game."" 
Red: ""Nobody was playing games today."" 
White: ""But not playing games may itself be a game 
The therapeutic antithesis is equally elegant. Logical paradoxes are forbidden. When White is 
deprived of this maneuver, his underlying anxieties come quickly to the fore. Closely allied to 
""Corner"" on the one hand, and to ""Threadbare"" on the other, is the marital game of ""Lunch Bag."" 
The husband, who can well afford to have lunch at a good restaurant, nevertheless makes himself a 
few sandwiches every morning, which he takes to the office in a paper bag. In this way he uses up 
crusts of bread, leftovers from dinner and paper bags which his wife saves for him. This gives him 
complete control over the family finances, for what wife would dare buy herself a mink stole in die 
face of such self-sacrifice? The husband reaps numerous other advantages, such as die privilege of 
eating lunch by himself and of catching up on his work during lunch hour. In many ways this is a 
constructive game which Benjamin Franklin would have approved of, since it encourages the 
virtues of thrift, hard work and punctuality. 

2 COURTROOM 
Thesis. Descriptively this belongs to the class of games which find their most florid expressions in 
law, and which includes ""Wooden Leg"" (the plea of insanity) and ""Debtor"" (the civil suit). 
Clinically it is most often seen in marital counseling and marital psychotherapy groups. Indeed, 
some marital counseling and marital groups consist of a perpetual game of ""Courtroom"" in which 
nothing is resolved, since the game is never broken up. In such cases it becomes evident that the 
counselor or therapist is heavily involved in the game without being aware of it. 
""Courtroom"" can be played by any number, but is essentially three-handed, with a plaintiff, a 
defendant and a judge, represented by a husband, a wife and the therapist. If it is played in a 
therapy group or over the radio or TV, die other members of the audience are cast as the jury. The 
husband begins plaintively, ""Let me tell you what (wife's name) did yesterday. She took the . . ."" 
etc., etc. The wife then responds defensively, ""Here is the way it really was . . . and besides just 

40

 
 
before that he was . . . and anyway at die time we were both . . ."" etc. The husband adds gallantly, 
""Well, I'm glad you people have a chance to hear both sides of the story, I only want to be fair."" At 
this point the counselor says judiciously, ""It seems to me that if we consider . . ."" etc., etc. If there is 
an audience, the therapist may throw it to them with: ""Well, let's hear what the others have to say."" 
Or, if the group is already trained, they will play the jury without any instruction from him. 
Antithesis. The therapist says to the husband, ""You're absolutely right!"" If the husband relaxes 
complacently or triumphantly, the therapist asks: ""How do you feel about my saying that?"" The 
husband replies: ""Fine."" Then the therapist says, ""Actually, I feel you're in the wrong."" If the 
husband is honest, he will say: ""I knew that all along."" If be is not honest, he will show 'some 
reaction that makes it clear a game is in progress. Then it becomes possible to go into the matter 
further. The game element lies in the fact that while the plaintiff' is overtly clamoring for victory, 
fundamentally he believes that he is wrong. 
After sufficient clinical material has been gathered to clarify the situation, the game can be 
interdicted by a maneuver which is one of the most elegant in the whole art of antithetics. The 
therapist makes a rule prohibiting the use of the (grammatical) third person in the group. 
Thenceforward the members can only address each other directly as ""you"" or talk about themselves 
as ""I,"" but they cannot say, ""Let me tell you about him"" or ""Let me tell you about her. ""At this point 
the couple stop playing games in the group altogether, or shift into ""Sweetheart,"" which is some 
improvement, or take up ""Furthermore,"" which is no help at all. ""Sweetheart"" is described in 
another section (page 107). In ""Furthermore"" the plaintiff makes one accusation after the other. The 
defendant replies to each, ""I can explain."" The plaintiff pays no attention to the explanation, but as 
soon as the defendant pauses, he launches into his next indictment with another ""furthermore,"" 
which is followed by another explanation—a typical Parent-Child interchange. 
""Furthermore"" is played most intensively by paranoid defendants. Because of their literalness, it is 
particularly easy for them to frustrate accusers who express themselves in humorous or 
metaphorical terms. In general, metaphors are the most obvious traps to avoid in a game of 
""Furthermore."" 
In its everyday form, ""Courtroom"" is easily observed in children as a three-handed game between 
two siblings and a parent. ""Mommy, she took my candy away"" ""Yes, but he took my doll, and 
before that he was hitting me, and anyway we both promised to share our candy.""

3 FRIGID WOMAN 
Thesis. This is almost always a marital game, since it is hardly conceivable that an informal liaison 
would present the required opportunities and privileges over a sufficient length of time, or that such 
a liaison would be maintained in the face of it. 

41

 
 
 
The husband makes advances to his wife and is repulsed. After repeated attempts, he is told that all 
men are beasts, he doesn't really love her, or doesn't love her for herself, that all he is interested in 
is sex. He desists for a time, then tries again with the same result. Eventually he resigns himself and 
makes no further advances. As the weeks or months pass, the wife becomes increasingly informal 
and sometimes forgetful. She walks through the bedroom half dressed or forgets her clean towel 
when she takes a bath so that he has to bring it to her. If she plays a hard game or drinks heavily, 
she may become flirtatious with other men at parties. At length he responds to those provocations 
and tries again. Once more he is repulsed, and a game of ""Uproar"" ensues involving their recent 
behavior, other couples, their in-laws, their finances and their failures, terminated by a slamming 
door. 
This time the husband makes up his mind that he is really through, that they will find a sexless 
modus vivendi, months pass. He declines the negligee parade and the forgotten towel maneuver. 
The wife becomes more provocatively informal and more provocatively forgetful, but he still 
resists. Then one evening she actually approaches him and kisses him. At first he doesn't respond, 
remembering his resolution, but soon nature begins to take its course after the long famine, and 
now he thinks he surely has it made. His first tentative advances are not repulsed. He becomes 
bolder and bolder. Just at the critical point, the wife steps back and cries: ""See, what did I tell you! 
All men are beasts, all I wanted was affection, but all you are interested in is sex!"" The ensuing 
game of ""Uproar"" at this point may skip the preliminary phases of their recent behavior and their 
in-laws, and go right to the financial problem. 
It should be noted that in spite of his protestations, the husband is usually just as afraid of sexual 
intimacy as his wife is, and has carefully chosen his mate to minimize • the danger of overtaxing 
his disturbed potency, which he can now blame on her. 
In its everyday form this game is played by unmarried ladies of various ages, which soon earns 
them a common slang epidiet. With diem it often merges into the game of indignation, or ""Rapo."" 
Antithesis. This is a dangerous game, and the possible antitheses are equally dangerous. Taking a 
mistress is a gamble. In the face of such stimulating competition, the wife may give up the game 
and try to initiate a normal married life, perhaps too late. On the other hand, she may use the affair, 
often with the help of a lawyer, as ammunition against the husband in a game of ""Now I've Got 
You, You Son of a Bitch."" The outcome is equally unpredictable if the husband undertakes 
psychotherapy and she does not. The wife's game may collapse as the husband grows stronger, 
leading to healthier adjustment; but if she is a hard player, improvement on his part may result in 
divorce. The best solution, if available, is for both parties to go into a transactional marital group, 
where the underlying advantages of the game and the basic sexual pathology can be laid bare. With 
this preparation both spouses may become interested in intensive individual psychotherapy. That 
may result in a psychological remarriage. If not, at least each of the parties may make a more 
sensible readjustment to the situation than they might have otherwise. 
The decent antithesis for the everyday form is to find another social companion. Some of the 
shrewder or more brutal antitheses are corrupt and even criminal. 
Relatives. The converse game, ""Frigid Man,"" is less common, but it takes much the same general 
course with some variations in detail. The final outcome depends upon the scripts of the parties 
involved. 
The crucial point of ""Frigid Woman"" is the terminal phase of ""Uproar."" Once this has run its course, 
sexual intimacy is out of the question, since both parties derive a perverse satisfaction from 
""Uproar"" and have no need of further sexual excitement from each other. Hence the most important 
item in anti-""Frigid Woman"" is to decline ""Uproar."" This leaves the wife in a state of sexual 
dissatisfaction which may be so acute that she will become more compliant. The use made of 
""Uproar"" distinguishes ""Frigid Woman"" from ""Beat Me Daddy,"" where ""Uproar"" is part of the 
foreplay; in ""Frigid Woman,"" ""Uproar"" substitutes for the sex act itself. Thus in ""Beat Me Daddy,"" 
""Uproar"" is a condition of the sexual act, a kind of fetish which increases the excitement, while in 
""Frigid Woman,"" once ""Uproar"" has taken place, die episode is finished. 

42

 
An early analogue of ""Frigid Woman"" is played by that type of prissy little girl described by 
Dickens in Great Expectations. She comes out in her starched dress and asks the little boy to make 
her a mud pie. Then she sneers at his dirty hands and clothing and tells him how clean she is,

play and belligerent exchanges. (6) Existential—I am pure. 

4 HARRIED 
Thesis. This is a game played by the harried housewife. Her situation requires that she be proficient 
in ten or twelve different occupations; or, stated otherwise, that she fill gracefully ten or twelve 
different roles. From time to time semi-facetious lists of these occupations or roles appear in the 
Sunday supplements: mistress, mother, nurse, housemaid, etc. Since these roles are usually 
conflicting and fatiguing, their imposition gives rise in the course of years to the condition 
symbolically known as ""Housewife's Knee"" (since the knee is used for rocking, scrubbing, lifting, 
driving and so forth), whose symptoms are succinctly summarized in the complaint: ""I'm tired."" 
Now, if the housewife is able to set her own pace and find enough satisfaction in loving her 
husband and children, she will not merely serve but enjoy her twenty-five years, and see the 
youngest child off to college with a pang of loneliness. But if on die one hand she is driven by her 
inner Parent and called to account by the critical husband she has chosen for that purpose, and on 
the other unable to get sufficient satisfaction from loving her family, she may grow more and more 
unhappy. At first she may try to console herself with the advantages of ""If It Weren't For You"" and 
""Blemish"" (and indeed, any housewife may fall back on these when the going gets rough); but soon 
these fail to keep her going. Then she has to find another way out, and that is the game of 
""Harried,"" 
The thesis of this game is simple. She takes on everything that comes, and even asks for more. She 
agrees with her husband's criticisms and accepts all her children's demands. If she has to entertain 
at dinner, she not only feels she must function impeccably as a conversationalist, chatelaine over 
the household and servants, interior decorator, caterer, glamour girl, virgin queen and diplomat; she 
will also volunteer that morning to bake a cake and take the children to the dentist. If she already 
feels harassed, she makes the day even more harried. Then in the middle of the afternoon she 
justifiably collapses, and nothing gets done. She lets down her husband, the children and their 
guests, and her self-reproaches add to her misery. After this happens two or three times her 
marriage is in jeopardy, the children are confused, she loses weight, her hair is untidy, her face is 
drawn and her shoes are scuffed. Then she appears at the psychiatrist's office, ready to be 
hospitalized. 
Antithesis. The logical antithesis is simple: Mrs. White can fill each of her roles in succession 
during the week, but she must refuse to play two or more of them simultaneously. When she gives a 
cocktail party. For example, she can play either caterer or nursemaid, but not both. If she is merely 
suffering from Housewife's Knee, she may be able to limit herself in this way. 

43

 
 
 
If she is actually playing a game of ""Harried,"" however, it will be very difficult for her to adhere to 
this principle. In that case the husband is carefully chosen; he is an otherwise reasonable man who 
will criticize his wife if she is not as efficient as he thinks his mother was. In effect, she marries his 
fantasy of his mother as perpetuated in his Parent, which is similar to her fantasy of her mother or 
grandmother. Having found a suitable partner, her Child can now settle into the harassed role 
necessary to maintain her psychic balance, and which she will not readily give up. The more 
occupational responsibility the husband has, the easier it is for both of them to find Adult reasons to 
preserve the unhealthy aspects of their relationship. 
When the position becomes untenable, often because of official school intervention on behalf of the 
unhappy offspring, the psychiatrist is called in to make it a three-handed game. Either the husband 
wants him to do an overhaul job in the wife, or the wife wants him as an ally against the husband. 
The ensuing proceedings depend on the skill and alertness of die psychiatrist. Usually the first 
phase, the alleviation of the wife's depression, will proceed smoothly. The second phase, in which 
she will give up playing ""Harried"" in favor of playing ""Psychiatry,"" is the decisive one. It tends to 
arouse increasing opposition from both spouses. Sometimes this is well concealed and then 
explodes suddenly, though not unexpectedly. If this stage is weathered, then the real work of game 
analysis can proceed. 
It is necessary to recognize that the real culprit is the wife's Parent, her mother or grandmother; the 
husband is to some extent only a lay figure chosen to play his role in die game. The therapist has to 
fight not only this Parent and the husband, who has a heavy investment in playing his end, but also 
the social environment, which encourages the wife's compliance. The week after the article appears 
about the many roles a housewife has to play, there is a How'nt I Doing? in the Sunday paper: a 
ten-item test to determine ""How Good A Hostess (Wife) (Modier) (Housekeeper) (Budgeteer) Are 
You?"" For the housewife who plays ""Harried,"" that is the equivalent of the little leaflet that comes 
with children's games, stating the rules. It may help to speed up die evolution of ""Harried,"" which, 
if not checked, may end in a game of ""State Hospital"" (""The last thing I want is to be sent to a 
hospital""). 
One practical difficulty with such couples is that die husband tends to avoid personal involvement 
with the treatment beyond playing ""Look How Hard I'm Trying,"" because he is usually more 
disturbed than he cares to admit. Instead he may send indirect messages to the therapist, through 
temper outbursts which he knows will be reported by the wife. Hence ""Harried"" easily progresses 
to a third-degree life-death-divorce struggle. The psychiatrist is almost alone on the side of life, 
assisted only by the harried Adult of the patient which is locked in combat that may prove mortal 
against all three aspects of the husband, allied with her own inner Parent and Child. It is a dramatic 
battle, with odds of two against five, which tries the skill of the most game-free and professional 
therapist. If he quails, he can take the easy way out and offer his patient on the altar of the divorce 
court, which is equivalent to saying ""I surrender—Let's you and him fight."" 

5 IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU 
Thesis. The detailed analysis of this game has already been given in Chapter 5. It was historically 
die second game uncovered, after ""Why Don't You—Yes But,"" which up to that point had been 
regarded merely as an interesting phenomenon. With the additional discovery of IWFY, it became 
clear that there must be a whole department of social action based on ulterior transactions. This led 
to a more active search for such goings-on, and the present collection is one outcome. 
Briefly, a woman marries a domineering man so that he will restrict her activities and thus keep her 
from getting into situations which frighten her. If this were a simple operation, she might express 
her gratitude when he performed this service for her. In the game of IWFY, however, her reaction 
is quite the opposite: she takes advantage of the situation to complain about the restrictions, which 
makes her spouse feel uneasy and gives her all sorts of advantages. This game is the internal social 
advantage. The external social advantage is the derivative pastime ""If It Weren't For Him,"" which 
she plays with her congenial lady friends. 

44

 
 
6 LOOK HOW HARD I'VE TRIED  
Thesis. In its common clinical form this is a three-handed game played by a married couple with a 
psychiatrist. The husband (usually) is bucking for a divorce, despite loud protestations to the 
contrary, while the spouse is more sincere in wanting to continue the marriage. He comes to the 
therapist under protest and talks just enough to demonstrate to the wife that he is cooperating; 
usually he plays a mild game of ""Psychiatry"" or ""Courtroom."" As time passes he exhibits either 
increasingly resentful pseudo-compliance or belligerent argumentativeness toward the therapist. At 
home he initially shows more ""understanding"" and restraint, and finally behaves worse than ever. 
After one, five or ten visits, depending on the skill of the therapist, he refuses to come any longer 
and goes hunting or fishing instead. The wife is then forced into filing for divorce. The husband is 
now blameless, since his wife has taken the initiative and he has demonstrated his good faith by 
going to the therapist. He is in a good position to say to any attorney, judge, friend or relative, 
""Look how hard I've tried!"" 
Antithesis. The couple is seen together. If one—let us say the husband—is clearly playing this 
game, the other is taken into individual treatment and the player is sent on his way, on the valid 
ground that he is less ready for therapy. He can still get a divorce, but only at die expense of 
abandoning his position that he is really trying. If necessary, the wife can start the divorce, and her 
position is much improved since she really has tried. The favorable, hoped-for outcome is that the 
husband, his game broken up, will go into a state of despair and then seek treatment elsewhere with 
genuine motivation. 
In its everyday form this is easily observed in children as a two-handed game with one parent. It is 
played from either of two positions: ""I am helpless"" or ""I am blameless."" The child tries, but 
bungles or is unsuccessful. If he is Helpless, the parent has to do it for him. If he is Blameless, the 
parent has no reasonable grounds for punishing him. This reveals the elements of the game. The 
parents should find out two things: which of them taught the child this game; and what they are 
doing to perpetuate it. 
An interesting, though sometimes sinister, variant is ""Look How Hard I Was Trying,"" which is 
usually a harder game of the second or third degree. This can be illustrated by the case of a hard-
working man with a gastric ulcer. There are many people with progressive physical disabilities who 
do the best they can to cope with the situation, and they may enlist the help of their families in a 
legitimate way. Such conditions, however, can also be exploited for ulterior purposes. 
First Degree: A man announces to his wife and friends that he has an ulcer. He also lets them know 
that he is continuing to work. This elicits their admiration. Perhaps a person with a painful and 
unpleasant condition is entitled to a certain amount of ostentation as a poor recompense for his 
suffering. He should be given due credit for not playing ""Wooden Leg"" instead, and deserves some 
reward for continuing to assume his responsibilities. In such a case, die courteous reply to 'Took 
How Hard I'm Trying"" is, ""Yes, we all admire your fortitude and conscientiousness."" 
Second Degree: A man is told that he has an ulcer, but keeps it a secret from his wife and friends. 
He continues working and worrying as hard as ever, and one day he collapses on the job. When his 
wife is notified, she gets the message instantly: ""Look How Hard I Was Trying."" Now she is 
supposed to appreciate him as she never has before, and to feel sorry for all the mean things she has 
said and done in the past. In short, she is now supposed to love him, all previous methods of 
wooing her having failed. Unfortunately for the husband, her manifestations of affection and 
solicitude at this point are more apt to be motivated by guilt than by love. Deep down she is likely 
to be resentful because he is using unfair leverage against her, and has also taken unfair advantage 
of her by keeping his illness a secret. In short, a diamond bracelet is a much more honest instrument 
of courtship than a perforated stomach. She has the option of throwing the jewelry back at him, but 
she cannot decently walk out on the ulcer. A sudden confrontation with a serious illness is more 
likely to make her feel trapped than won over. 

45

 
 
This game can often be discovered immediately after the patient first hears that he has a potentially 
progressive disability. If he is going to play it, the whole plan will very likely flash through his 
mind at that point, and can be recovered by a careful psychiatric review of the situation. What is 
recovered is the secret gloating of his Child at learning that he has such a weapon, masked by his 
Adult concern at the practical problems raised by his illness. 
Third Degree: Even more sinister and spiteful is the sudden unheralded suicide because of serious 
illness. The ulcer progresses to cancer, and one day the wife, who has never been informed that 
anything serious is amiss, walks into' the bathroom and finds her husband lying there dead. The 
note says clearly enough, ""Look How Hard I Was Trying."" If something like this happens twice to 
the same woman, it is time for her to find out what she has been playing.

7 SWEETHEART 
Thesis. This is seen in its fullest flower in the early stages of marital group therapy, when the 
parties feel defensive; it can also be observed on social occasions. White makes a subtly derogatory 
remark about Mrs. White, disguised as an anecdote, and ends: ""Isn't that right, sweetheart?"" Mrs. 
White tends to agree for two ostensibly Adult reasons: (a) because the anecdote itself is, in the main, 
accurately reported, and to disagree about what is presented as a peripheral detail (but is really the 
essential point of the transaction) would seem pedantic; (b) because it would seem surly to disagree 
with a man who calls one ""sweetheart"" in public. The psychological reason for her agreement, 
however, is her depressive position. She married him precisely because she knew he would perform 
this service for her: exposing her deficiencies and thus saving her from the embarrassment of 
having to expose them herself. Her parents accommodated her the same way when she was little. 
Next to ""Courtroom,"" this is the most common game played in marital groups. The more tense the 
situation, and the closer the game is to exposure, the more bitterly is the word ""sweetheart"" 
enunciated, until the underlying resentment becomes obvious. On careful consideration it can be 
seen that this is a relative of ""Schlemiel,"" since the significant move is Mrs. White's implicit 
forgiveness for White's resentment, of which she is trying hard not to be aware. Hence anti-
""Sweetheart"" is played analogously to anti-""Schlemiel"": ""You can tell derogatory anecdotes about 
me, but please don't call me 'sweetheart'"" This antithesis carries with it the same perils as does anti-
""Schlemiel."" A more sophisticated and less dangerous antithesis is to reply: ""Yes, honey!"" 
In another form the wife, instead of agreeing, responds with a similar ""Sweetheart"" type anecdote 
about the husband, saying in effect, ""You have a dirty face too, dear."" 
Sometimes the endearments are not actually pronounced, but a careful listener can hear them even 
when they are unspoken. This is ""Sweetheart,"" Silent Type.

CHAPTER EIGHT 
Party Games 

PARTIES are for pastimes, and pastimes are for parties (including the period before a group 
meeting officially begins), but as acquaintanceship ripens, games begin to emerge. The Schlemiel 
and his victim recognize each other, as do Big Daddy and Little Old Me; all the familiar but 
disregarded processes of selection get under way. In this section four games which are typically 
played in ordinary social situations are considered: ""Ain't It Awful,"" ""Blemish,"" ""Schlemiel,"" and 
""Why Don't You—Yes But."" 

1 AIN'T IT AWFUL 
Thesis. This is played in four significant forms: Parental pastime, Adult pastime, Child pastime and 
game. In the pastimes there is no denouement or payoff, but much un-wordly feeling. 
1. ""Nowadays"" is the self-righteous, punitive or even vicious parental pastime. Sociologically it is 
common among certain types of middle-aged women with small independent incomes. One such 
woman withdrew from a therapy group when her opening move was met with silence instead of 
with the excited corroboration she was accustomed to in her social circle. In this more sophisticated 
group, accustomed to game analysis, there was a conspicuous lack of togetherness when White 
remarked: ""Speaking of not trusting people, it's no wonder you can't trust anyone nowadays. I was 
looking through the desk of one of my roomers, and you won't believe what I found."" She knew the 
answers to most of the current community problems: juvenile delinquency (parents too soft 
nowadays); divorce (wives without enough to do to keep them busy nowadays); crime (foreigners 
moving into white neighborhoods nowadays); and rising prices (businessmen too grasping 
nowadays). She made it clear that she herself was not soft with her delinquent son, nor with her 
delinquent tenants. 
""Nowadays"" is differentiated from idle gossip by its slogan ""It's no wonder."" The opening move 
may be the same ('They say that Flossie Murgatroyd""), but in ""Nowadays"" there is direction and 
closure; an ""explanation"" may be offered. Idle gossip merely rambles or trails off. 
2. ""Broken Skin"" is the more benevolent Adult variation, with the slogan ""What a pity!"" although 
the underlying motivations are equally morbid. ""Broken Skin"" deals primarily with the flow of 
blood; it is essentially an informal clinical colloquium. Anyone is eligible to present a case, the 
more horrifying the better, and details are eagerly considered. Blows in the face, abdominal 
operations and difficult childbirths are accepted topics. Here the differentiation from idle gossip lies 
in the rivalry and surgical sophistication. Pathological anatomy, diagnosis, prognosis and 
comparative case studies are systematically pursued. A good prognosis is approved in idle gossip, 
but in ""Broken Skin"" a consistently hopeful outlook, unless obviously insincere, may invoke a 
secret meeting of the Credentials Committee because the player is -non -particeps criminis. 
3. ""Water Cooler,"" or ""Coffee Break,"" is the Child pastime, with the slogan ""Look what they're 
doing to us now."" This is an organizational variant. It may be played after dark in the milder 
political or economic form called ""Bar Stool."" It is actually three-handed, the ace being held by the 
often shadowy figure called ""They."" 
4. As a game, ""Ain't It Awful"" finds its most dramatic expression in polysurgery addicts, and their 
transactions illustrate its characteristics. These are doctor-shoppers, people who actively seek 
surgery even in the face of sound medical opposition. The experience itself, the hospitalization and 
surgery, brings its own advantages. The internal psychological advantage comes from having the 
body mutilated; the external psychological advantage lies in the avoidance of all intimacies and 
responsibilities except complete surrender to the surgeon. The biological advantages are typified by 

47

 
 
 
 
nursing care. The internal social advantages come from the medical and nursing staff, and from 
other patients. After the patient's discharge the external social advantages are gained by provoking 
sympathy and awe. In its extreme form this game is played professionally by fraudulent or 
determined liability and malpractice claimants, who may earn a living by deliberately or 
opportunistically incurring disabilities. They then demand not only sympathy, as amateur players 
do, but indemnification. ""Ain't It Awful"" becomes a game, then, when the player overtly expresses 
distress, but is covertly gratified at the prospect of the satisfactions he can wring from his 
misfortune. 
In general, people who suffer misfortunes may be divided into three classes. 
1. Those in whom the suffering is inadvertent and unwanted. These may or may not exploit the 
sympathy which is so readily offered to them. Some exploitation is natural enough, and may be 
treated with common courtesy. 
2. Those in whom the suffering is inadvertent, but is gratefully received because of the 
opportunities for exploitation it offers. Here the game is an afterthought, a ""secondary gain"" in 
Freud's sense. 
3. Those who seek suffering, like polysurgery addicts who go from one surgeon to another until 
they find one willing to operate. Here the game is the primary consideration. 

2 BLEMISH 
Thesis. This game is the source of a large percentage of petty dissension in everyday life; it is 
played from the depressive Child position ""I am no good,"" which is protectively transformed into 
the Parental position ""They are no good."" The player's transactional problem is, then, to prove the 
latter thesis. Hence ""Blemish"" players do not feel comfortable with a new person until they have 
found his blemish. In its hardest form it may become a totalitarian political game played by 
""authoritarian"" personalities, and then it may have serious historical repercussions. Here its close 
relationship with ""Nowadays"" is evident. In suburban society positive reassurance is obtained from 
playing ""How'm I Doing?"" while ""Blemish"" provides negative reassurance. A partial analysis will 
make some of the elements of this game clearer. 
The premise may range from the most trivial and extraneous (""Last year's hat""), to the most cynical 
(""Hasn't got $7,000 in the bank""), sinister (""Not 100% Aryan""), esoteric (""Hasn't read Rilke""), 
intimate (""Can't hold his erection"") or sophisticated (""What's he trying to prove?""). 
Psychodynamically it is usually based on sexual insecurity, and its aim is reassurance. 
Transactionally there is prying, morbid curiosity or watchfulness, sometimes with Parental or Adult 
concern charitably masking the Child's relish. It has the internal psychological advantage of 
warding off depression, and the external psychological advantage of avoiding the intimacy which 
might expose White's own blemishes. White feels justified in turning away an unfashionable 
woman, a man without financial backing, a non-Aryan, an illiterate, an impotent man or' an 
insecure personality. At the same time the prying offers some internal social action with biological 
gain. The external social advantage is of the ""Ain't It Awful"" family—Neighborly Type. 
An interesting sidelight is that White's choice of premise is independent of his intellectual capacity 
or apparent sophistication. Thus a man who had held some responsible positions in the foreign 
service of his country told an audience that another country was inferior because, among other 
things, the men wore jackets with sleeves that were too long. In his Adult ego state this man was 
quite competent. Only when playing a Parental game like ""Blemish"" would he mention such 
irrelevancies. 

3 SCHLEMIEL 
Thesis. The term ""schlemiel"" does not refer to the hero of Chamisso's novel, who was a man 
without a shadow, but to a popular Yiddish word allied to the German and Dutch words for cunning. 

48

 
 
 
The Schlemiel's victim, who is something like the ""Good-Natured Fellow"" of Paul de Kock, is 
colloquially called the Schlemazl. The moves in a typical game of ""Schlemiel"" are as follows: 
1W. White spills a highball on the hostess's evening gown. 
1B. Black (the host) responds initially with rage, but he senses (often only vaguely) that if he shows 
it, White wins. Black therefore pulls himself together, and this gives him the illusion that he wins. 
2W. White says: ""I'm sorry."" 
2B. Black mutters or cries forgiveness, strengthening his illusion that he wins. 
3W. White then proceeds to inflict other damage on Black's property. He breaks things, spills 
things and makes messes of various kinds. After the cigarette burn in the tablecloth, the chair leg 
through the lace curtain and the gravy on the rug, White's Child is exhilarated because he has 
enjoyed himself in carrying out these procedures, for all of which he has been forgiven, while 
Black has made a gratifying display of suffering self-control. Thus both of them profit from an 
unfortunate situation, and Black is not necessarily anxious to terminate the friendship. 
As in most games, White, who makes the first move, wins either way. If Black shows his anger, 
White can feel justified in returning the resentment. If Black restrains himself, White can go on 
enjoying his opportunities. The real payoff in this game, however, is not the pleasure of 
destructiveness, which is merely an added bonus for White, but the fact that he obtains forgiveness. 
This leads directly into the antithesis. 
Antithesis. Anti-""Schlemiel"" is played by not offering the demanded absolution. After White says, 
""I'm sorry,"" Black, instead of muttering ""It's okay,"" says, ""Tonight you can embarrass my wife, ruin 
the furniture and wreck the rug, but please don't say Tm sorry.'"" Here Black switches from being a 
Forgiving Parent to being an objective Adult who takes the full responsibility for having invited 
White in the first place. 
The intensity of White's game will be revealed by his reaction, which may be quite explosive. One 
who plays anti-""Schlemiel"" runs the risk of immediate reprisals or, at any rate, of making an enemy. 
Children play ""Schlemiel"" in an abortive form in which they are not always sure of forgiveness but 
at least have the pleasure of making messes; as they learn to comport themselves socially, however, 
they may take advantage of their increasing sophistication to obtain the forgiveness which is the 
chief goal of the game as played in polite, grown-up social circles. 

ANALYSIS 
Thesis: I can he destructive and still get forgiveness. 
Aim: Absolution. 
Roles: Aggressor, Victim (Colloquially, Schlemiel and Schlemazl). 
Dynamics: Anal aggression. 
Examples: (1) Messily destructive children. (2) Clumsy guest. 
Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. 
Adult: ""Since I'm polite, you have to be polite, too."" Adult: ""That's fine. I forgive you."" 
Psychological Paradigm: Child-Parent. 
*The examples given for this and the next game (YDYB) follow those given previously by the 
author in Transactions! Analysis. 
Child: ""You have to forgive things which appear accidental."" 
Parent: ""You are right. I have to show you what good manners are."" 
Moves: (1) Provocation-resentment. (2) Apology-forgiveness. 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—pleasure of messing. (2) External Psychological—Avoids 
punishment. (3) Internal Social—""Schlemiel."" (4) External Social—""Schlemiel."" (5) Biological—
provocative and gentle stroking. (6) Existential—I am blameless. 

4 WHY DON'T YOU-YES BUT  
Thesis. ""Why Don't You—Yes But"" occupies a special place in game analysis, because it was the 
original stimulus for the concept of games. It was the first game to be dissected out of its social 

49

 
 
 
context, and since it is the oldest subject of game analysis, it is one of the best understood. It is also 
the game most commonly played at parties and groups of all kinds, including psychotherapy groups. 
The following example will serve to illustrate its main characteristics: 
White: ""My husband always insists on doing our own repairs, and he never builds anything right."" 
Black: ""Why doesn't he take a course in carpentry?"" White: ""Yes, but he doesn't have time."" Blue: 
""Why don't you buy him some good tools'?"" White: ""Yes, but he doesn't know how to use them."" 
Red: ""Why don't you have your building done by a carpenter?"" 
White: ""Yes, but that would cost too much."" Brown: ""Why don't you just accept what he does the 
way he does it}"" 
White: ""Yes, but the whole thing might fall down."" 
Such an exchange is typically followed by a silence. It is eventually broken by Green, who may say 
something like, ""That's men for you, always trying to show how efficient they are."" 
YDYB can be played by any number. The agent presents a problem. The others start to present 
solutions, each beginning with ""Why don't you . . . ?"" To each of these White objects with a ""Yes, 
but. ..."" A good player can stand off the others indefinitely until they all give up, whereupon White 
wins. In many situations she might have to handle a dozen or more solutions to engineer the 
crestfallen silence which signifies her victory, and which leaves the field open for the next game in 
the above paradigm, Green switching into ""PI A,"" Delinquent Husband Type. 
Since the solutions are, with rare exceptions, rejected, it is apparent that this game must serve some 
ulterior purpose. YDYB is not played for its ostensible purpose (an Adult quest for information or 
solutions), but to reassure and gratify the Child. A bare transcript may sound Adult, but in the 
living tissue it can be observed that White presents herself as a Child inadequate to meet the 
situation; whereupon the others become transformed into sage Parents anxious to dispense their 
wisdom for her benefit.

< FIGURE 8 > Why Don't You-Yes But  

This is illustrated in Figure 8. The game can proceed because at the social level both stimulus and 
response are Adult to Adult, and at the psychological level they are also complementary, with 
Parent to Child stimulus (""Why don't you. . . •"") eliciting Child to Parent response (""Yes, but. . . ."")• 
The psychological level is usually unconscious on both sides, but the shifts in ego state (Adult to 
""inadequate"" Child on White's part. Adult to ""wise"" Parent by the others) can often be detected by 
an alert observer from changes in posture, muscular tone, voice and vocabulary. 
In order to illustrate the implications, it is instructive to follow through on the example given above. 
Therapist: ""Did anyone suggest anything you hadn't thought of yourself?"" 

50

 
 
 
 
 
White: ""No, they didn't. As a matter of fact, I've actually tried almost everything they suggested. I 
did buy my husband some tools, and he did take a course in carpentry."" 
Here White demonstrates two of the reasons why the proceedings should not be taken at face value. 
First, in the majority of cases White is as intelligent as anyone else in the company, and it is very 
unlikely that others will suggest any solution that she has not thought of herself. If someone does 
happen to come up with an original suggestion, White will accept it gratefully if she is playing fair; 
that is, her ""inadequate"" Child will give way if anyone present has an idea ingenious enough to 
stimulate her Adult. But habitual YDYB players, such as White above, seldom play fair. On the 
other hand, a too ready acceptance of suggestions raises the question of whether the YDYB is not 
masking an underlying game of ""Stupid."" 
The example given is particularly dramatic, because it clearly illustrates the second point. Even if 
White has actually tried some of the solutions presented, she will still object to them. The purpose 
of the game is not to get suggestions, but to reject them. 
While almost anyone will play this game under proper circumstances because of its time-
structuring value, careful study of individuals who particularly favor it reveals several interesting 
features. First, they characteristically can and will play either side of the game with equal facility. 
This switchability of roles is true of all games. Players may habitually prefer one role to another, 
but they are capable of trading, and they are willing to play any other role in the same game, if for 
some reason that is indicated. (Compare, for example, the switch from Drinker to Rescuer in the 
game of ""Alcoholic."") 
Second, in clinical practice it is found that people who favor YDYB belong to that class of patients 
who eventually request hypnosis or some sort of hypnotic injection as a method of speeding up 
their treatment. When they are playing the game, their object is to demonstrate that no one can give 
them an acceptable suggestion—that is, they will never surrender: whereas with the therapist, they 
request a procedure which will put them in a state of complete surrender. It is thus apparent that 
YDYB represents a social solution to a conflict about surrender. 
Even more specifically, this game is common among people who have a fear of blushing, as die 
following therapeutic exchange demonstrates: 
Therapist: ""Why do you play 'Why Don't You—Yes But' if you know it's a con?"" 
White: ""If I'm talking to somebody I have to keep thinking of things to say. If I don't, I'll blush. 
Except in the dark. I can't stand a lull. I know it, and my husband knows it, too. He's always told 
me that."" 
Therapist: ""You mean if your Adult doesn't keep busy, your Child takes the chance to pop up and 
make you feel embarrassed?"" 
White: ""That's it. So if I can keep making suggestions to somebody, or get him to make suggestions 
to me, then I'm all right, I'm protected. As long as I can keep my Adult in control, I can postpone 
the embarrassment."" 
Here White indicates clearly that she fears unstructured time. Her Child is prevented from 
advertising as long as the Adult can be kept busy in a social situation, and a game offers a suitable 
structure for Adult functioning. But the game must be suitably motivated in order to maintain her 
interest. Her choice of YDYB is influenced by the principle of economy: it yields die maximum 
internal and external advantages to her Child's conflicts about physical passivity. She could play 
with equal zest either die shrewd Child who cannot be dominated or the sage Parent who tries to 
dominate the Child in someone else, but fails. Since the basic principle of YDYB is that no 
suggestion is ever accepted, the Parent is never successful. The motto of the game is: ""Don't get 
panicky, the Parent never succeeds."" 
In summary, then: while each move is amusing, so to speak, to White, and brings its own little 
pleasure in rejecting the suggestion, the real payoff is the silence or masked silence which ensues 
when all the others have racked their brains and grown tired of trying to think of acceptable 
solutions. This signifies to White and to them that she has won by demonstrating it is they who are 
inadequate. If the silence is not masked, it may persist for several minutes. In the paradigm, Green 
cut White's triumph short because of her eagerness to start a game of her own, and that was what 

51

 
kept her from participating in White's game. Later on in the session, White demonstrated her 
resentment against Green for having abridged her moment of victory. 
Another curious feature of YDYB is that the external and internal games are played exactly the 
same way, with die roles reversed. In the external form, the one observed clinically, White's Child 
comes out to play the role of the inadequate helpseeker in a many-handed situation. In the 
internal form, the more intimate two-handed game played at home with her husband, her Parent 
comes out as the wise, efficient suggestion-giver, This reversal is usually secondary, however, 
since during the courtship she plays the helpless Child side, and only after the honeymoon is over 
does her bossy Parent begin to emerge into the open. There may have been slips as the wedding 
approached, but her fiance will overlook these in his eagerness to settle down with his carefully 
chosen bride. If he does not overlook them, the engagement may be called off for ""good reasons,"" 
and White, sadder but no wiser, will resume her search for a suitable mate. 
Antithesis. It is evident that those who respond to White's first move, the presentation of her 
""problem,"" are playing a form of ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" (ITHY). In fact YDYB is the 
inverse of ITHY. In ITHY there is one therapist and many clients: in YDYB one client and many 
""therapists."" The clinical antithesis to YDYB, therefore, is not to play ITHY. If the opening is of 
the form: ""What do you do if . . ."" (WYDI), a suggested response is: ""That is a difficult problem. 
What are you going to do about it?"" If it is of the form: ""X didn't work out properly,"" the response 
then should be ""That is too bad."" Both of these are polite enough to leave White at a loss, or at least 
to elicit a crossed transaction, so that his frustration becomes manifest and can then be explored. In 
a therapy group it is good practice for susceptible patients to refrain from playing ITHY when 
invited. Then not only White, but the other members as well, can learn from anti-YDYB, which is 
merely the other side of anti-ITHY. 
In a social situation, if the game is friendly and harmless, there is no reason not to participate. If it 
is an attempt to exploit professional knowledge, an antithetical move may be required; but in such 
situations this arouses resentment because of the exposure of White's Child. The best policy under 
those circumstances is to flee from the opening move and look for a stimulating game of first-
degree ""Rapo."" 
Relatives. ""Why Don't You—Yes But"" must be distinguished from its obverse, ""Why Did You—
No But"" (YDNB), in which it is the Parent who wins and the defensive Child who eventually 
retires in confusion, although again the bare transcript may sound factual, rational and Adult to 
Adult. YDNB is closely related to ""Furthermore."" 
The reverse of YDYB at first resembles ""Peasant."" Here White seduces the therapist into giving her 
suggestions which she immediately accepts, rather than rejects. Only after he is deeply involved 
does he perceive that White is aiming on him. What looked like ""Peasant"" ends up as a game of 
intellectual ""Rapo."" The classical version of this is the switch from positive to negative transference 
in the course of orthodox psychoanalysis. 
YDYB may also be played in a second-degree hard form as ""Do Me Something."" The patient 
refuses to do the housework, for example, and there is a game of YDYB every evening when the 
husband returns home. But no matter what he says, she sullenly refuses to change her ways. In 
some cases the sullenness may be malignant and require careful psychiatric evaluation. The game 
aspect must be considered as well, however, since it raises the question of why the husband 
selected such a spouse, and how he contributes to maintaining the situation.

CHAPTER NINE 
Sexual Games 
SOME games are played to exploit or fight off sexual impulses. These are all, in effect, perversions 
of the sexual instincts in which the satisfaction is displaced from the sexual act to the crucial 
transactions which constitute die payoff of the game. This cannot always be demonstrated 
convincingly, because such games are usually played in privacy, so that clinical information about 
them has to be obtained secondhand, and the informant's bias cannot always be satisfactorily 
evaluated. The psychiatric conception of homosexuality, for example, is heavily skewed, because 
the more aggressive and successful ""players"" do not often come for psychiatric treatment, and die 
available material mostly concerns the passive partners. 
The games included here are: ""Let's You and Him Fight,"" ""Perversion,"" ""Rapo,"" ""Stocking Game"" 
and ""Uproar,"" In most cases, the agent is a woman. This is because the hard forms of sexual games 
in which' the man is the agent verge on or constitute criminality, and properly belong in the 
Underworld section. On the other side, sexual games and marital games overlap, but the ones 
described here are readily available to unmarried people as well as to spouses. 

1 LET'S YOU AND HIM FIGHT  
Thesis. This may be a maneuver, a ritual or a game. In each case the psychology is essentially 
feminine. Because of its dramatic qualities, LYAHF is the basis of much of the world's literature, 
both good and bad. 
1, As a maneuver it is romantic. The woman maneuvers or challenges two men into fighting, with 
the implication or promise that she will surrender herself to the winner, 
After the competition is decided, she fulfills her bargain. This is an honest transaction, and the 
presumption is that she and her mate live happily ever after. 
2. As a ritual, it tends to be tragic. Custom demands that the two men fight for her, even if she does 
not want them to, and even if she has already made her choice. If the wrong man wins, she must 
nevertheless take him. In this case it is society and not the woman who sets up LYAHF. If she is 
willing, the transaction is an honest one. If she is unwilling or disappointed, the outcome may offer 
her considerable scope for playing games, such as ""Let's Pull A Fast One on Joey."" 
3. As a game it is comic. The woman sets up the competition, and while the two men are fighting, 
she decamps with a third. The internal and external psychological advantages for her and her mate 
are derived from the position that honest competition is for suckers, and the comic story they have 
lived through forms the basis for the internal and external social advantages. 

2 PERVERSION 
Thesis. Heterosexual perversions such as fetishism, sadism and masochism are symptomatic of a 
confused Child and are treated accordingly. Their transactional aspects, however, as manifested m 
actual sexual situations, can be dealt with by means of game analysis. This may lead to social 
control, so that even if the warped sexual impulses remain unchanged, they are neutralized as far as 
actual indulgence is concerned. 
People who are suffering from mild sadistic or masochistic distortions tend to take a primitive kind 
of Mental Health position. They feel that they are strongly sexed, and that prolonged abstinence 
will lead to serious consequences. Neither of these conclusions is necessarily true, but they form 
the basis for a game of ""Wooden Leg"" with the plea: ""What do you expect from someone as 
strongly sexed as I am?"" 
Antithesis. To extend ordinary courtesy to oneself and one's partner; dial is, to refrain from verbal 
or physical flagellation and confine oneself to more conventional forms of coitus. If White is a true 
pervert, this will lay bare the second element of the game, which is often clearly expressed in his 
dreams: that coitus itself has little interest For him, and that his real satisfaction is derived from the 

54

 
 
 
humiliating foreplay. This is something that he may not have cared to admit to himself. But it will 
now become clear to him that his complaint is: ""After all this work, I have to have intercourse, 
yet!"" At this point the position is much more favorable for specific psychotherapy, and much of the 
pleading and evasiveness has been nullified. This applies to ordinary ""sexual psychopaths"" as seen 
in practice, and not to malignant schizophrenic or criminal perversions, nor to those who confine 
their sexual activities to fantasy. 
The game of ""Homosexuality"" has become elaborated into a subculture in many countries, just as it 
is ritualized in others. Many of the disabilities which result from homosexuality arise from making 
it into a game. The provocative behavior which gives rise to ""Cops and Robbers,"" ""Why Does This 
Always Happen to Us,"" ""It's the Society We Live In,"" ""AH Great Men Were"" and so forth, is often 
amenable to social control, which reduces the handicaps to a minimum. The ""professional 
homosexual"" wastes a large amount of time and energy which could be applied to other ends. 
Analysis of his games may help him establish a quiet manage which will leave him free to enjoy 
the benefits that bourgeois society offers, instead of devoting himself to playing his own variation 
of ""Ain't It Awful!"" 

3 RAPO 
Thesis. This is a game played between a man and a woman which might more politely be called, in 
the milder forms at least, ""Kiss Off"" or ""Indignation."" It may be played with varying degrees of 
intensity. 
1. First-Degree ""Rapo,"" or ""Kiss Off,"" is popular at social gatherings and consists essentially of 
mild flirtation. White signals that she is available and gets her pleasure from the man's pursuit. As 
soon as he has committed himself, the game is over. If she is polite, she may say quite frankly ""I 
appreciate your compliments and thank you very much,"" and move on to the next conquest. If she 
is less generous, she may simply leave him. A skillful player can make this game last for a long 
time at a large social gathering by moving around frequently, so that the man has to carry out 
complicated maneuvers in order to follow her without being too obvious. 
2. In Second-Degree ""Rapo,"" or ""Indignation,"" White gets only secondary satisfaction from Black's 
advances. Her primary gratification comes from rejecting him, so that this game is also colloquially 
known as ""Buzz Off, Buster."" She leads Black into a much more serious commitment than the mild 
flirtation of First-Degree ""Rapo"" and enjoys watching his discomfiture when she repulses him. 
Black, of course, is not as helpless as he seems, and may have gone to considerable trouble to get 
himself involved. Usually he is playing some variation of ""Kick Me."" 
3. Third-Degree ""Rapo"" is a vicious game which ends in murder, suicide or the courtroom. Here 
White leads Black into compromising physical contact and then claims that he has made a criminal 
assault or has done her irreparable damage. In its most cynical form White may actually allow him 
to complete the sexual act so that she gets that enjoyment before confronting him. The 
confrontation may be immediate, as in the illegitimate cry of rape, or it may be long delayed, as in 
suicide or homicide following a prolonged love affair. If she chooses to play it as a criminal assault, 
she may have no difficulty in finding mercenary or morbidly interested allies, such as the press, the 
police, counselors and relatives. Sometimes, however, these outsiders may cynically turn on her, so 
that she loses the initiative and becomes a tool in their games. 
In some cases outsiders perform a different function. 
They force the game on an unwilling White because they want to play ""Let's You and Him Fight."" 
They put her in such a position that in order to save her face or her reputation she has to cry rape. 
This is particularly apt to happen with girls under the legal age of consent; they may be quite 
willing to continue a liaison, but because it is discovered or made an issue of, they feel constrained 
to turn the romance into a game of Third-Degree ""Rapo."" 
In one well-known situation, the wary Joseph refused to be inveigled into a game of ""Rapo,"" 
whereupon Potiphar's wife made the classical switch into ""Let's You and Him Fight,"" an excellent 
example of the way a hard player reacts to antithesis, and of the dangers that beset people who 

55

 
 
refuse to play games, These two games are combined in the well-known ""Badger Game,"" in which 
the woman seduces Black and then cries rape, at which point her husband takes charge and abuses 
Black for purposes of blackmail. 
One of the most unfortunate and acute forms of Third-Degree ""Rapo"" occurs relatively frequently 
between homosexual strangers, who in a matter of an hour or so may bring the game to a point of 
homicide. The cynical and criminal variations of this game contribute a large volume to sensational 
newspaper copy. 
The childhood prototype of ""Rapo"" is the same as that of ""Frigid Woman,"" in which the little girl 
induces the boy to humiliate himself or get dirty and then sneers at him, as classically described by 
Maugham in Of Hitman Bondage and, as already noted, by Dickens in Great Expectations. This is 
Second Degree. A harder form, approaching Third Degree, may be played in tough neighborhoods. 
Antithesis. The man's ability to avoid becoming involved in this game or to keep it under control 
depends on his capacity to distinguish genuine expressions of feeling from moves in the game. If he 
is thus able to exert social control, he may obtain a great deal of pleasure from the mild flirtations 
of ""Kiss Off."" On the other hand it is difficult to conceive of a safe antithesis for the Potiphar's 
Wife maneuver, other than checking out before closing time with no forwarding address. In 1938 
the writer met an aging Joseph in Aleppo who had checked out of Constantinople thirty-two years 
previously, after one of the Sultan's ladies had cornered him during a business visit to the Yildiz 
harem. He had to abandon his shop, but took time to pick up his hoard of gold francs, and had 
never returned. 
Relatives. The male versions of ""Rapo"" are notoriously found in commercial situations: ""Casting 
Couch"" (and then she didn't get the part) and ""Cuddle Up"" (and then she got fired). 

ANALYSIS 
The following analysis refers to Third-Degree ""Rapo"" because there the elements of the game are 
more dramatically illustrated. 
Aim: Malicious revenge. Roles: Seductress, Wolf. 
Dynamics (Third Degree): Penis envy, oral violence. ""Kiss Off"" is phallic, while ""Indignation"" has 
strong anal elements. 
Examples: (1) I'll tell on you, you dirty little boy. (2) Wronged woman. 
Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. 
Adult (male): ""I'm sorry if I went further than you intended me to."" 
Adult (female) ""You have violated me and must pay the full penalty."" 
Psychological Paradigm: Child-Child. 
Child (male): ""See how irresistible I am."" Child (female): ""Now I've got you, you son of a bitch."" 
Moves: (1) Female: seduction; Male: counter-seduction. (2) Female: surrender; Male: victory. (3) 
Female: confrontation; Male: collapse. 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—expression of 
hatred and projection of guilt. (2) External Psychological-avoidance of emotional sexual intimacy. 
(3) Internal Social -""Now I've Got You, You Son of a Bitch."" (4) External Social-""Ain't It Awful,"" 
""Courtroom,"" ""Let's You and Him Fight."" (5) Biological—sexual and belligerent exchanges. (6) 
Existential-I am blameless. 

4 THE STOCKING GAME 
Thesis. This is a game of the ""Rapo"" family; in it the most obvious characteristic is the 
exhibitionism, which is hysterical in nature. A woman comes into a strange group and after a very 
short time raises her leg, exposing herself in a provocative way, and remarks, ""Oh my, I have a run 
in my stocking."" This is calculated to arouse the men sexually and to make the other women angry. 
Any confrontation of White is met, of course, with protestations of innocence or counter-
accusations, hence the resemblance to classical ""Rapo."" What is significant is White's lack of 
adaptation. She seldom waits to find out what kind of people she is dealing with or how to time her 

56

 
 
 
maneuver. Hence it stands out as inappropriate and affects her relationships with her associates. In 
spite of some superficial ""sophistication,"" she fails to understand what happens to her in life 
because her judgment of human nature is too cynical. The aim is to prove that other people have 
lascivious minds, and her Adult is conned by her Child and her Parent (usually a lascivious mother) 
into ignoring both her own provocative-ness and the good sense of many of the people she meets. 
Thus the game tends to be self-destructive. 
This is probably a phallic variant of a game whose content depends on the underlying disturbance. 
An ""oral"" variant may be exhibited by women with deeper pathology and well-developed breasts. 
Such women often sit with their hands behind their heads so as to thrust their breasts forward; they 
may draw additional attention to them by remarking about their size or some pathology such as an 
operation or a lump. Some types of squirming probably constitute an anal variant. The implication 
of this game is that the woman is sexually available. Thus it may be played in a more symbolic 
form by bereaved women who ""exhibit"" their widowhood insincerely. 
Antithesis. Along with the poor adaptation, these women show little tolerance for antithesis. If the 
game is ignored or countered by a sophisticated therapy group, for example, they may not return. 
Antithesis must be carefully distinguished in this game from reprisal, since the latter signifies that 
White has won. Women are more skillful at counter-moves in ""Stocking Game"" than men, who 
indeed have little incentive to break up this game. Antithesis, therefore, is best left to the discretion 
of the other women present. 

5 UPROAR 
Thesis. The classical game is played between domineering fathers and teen-age daughters, where 
there is a sexually inhibited mother. Father comes home from work and finds fault with daughter, 
who answers impudently; or daughter may make the first move by being impudent, whereupon 
father finds Fault. Their voices rise, and the clash becomes more acute. The outcome depends on 
who has the initiative. There are three possibilities; (a) father retires to his bedroom and slams the 
door (b) daughter retires to her bedroom and slams the door (c) both retire to their respective 
bedrooms and slam the doors. In any case, the end of a game of ""Uproar"" is marked by a slamming 
door. ""Uproar"" offers a distressing but effective solution to the sexual problems that arise between 
fathers and teen-age daughters in certain households. Often they can only live in the same house 
together if they are angry at each other, and the slamming doors emphasize for each of them the 
fact that they have separate bedrooms. 
In degenerate households this game may be played in a sinister and repellent form in which father 
waits up for daughter whenever she goes out on a date, and examines her and her clodiing carefully 
on her return to make sure that she has not had intercourse. The slightest suspicious circumstance 
may give rise to the most violent altercation, which may end with the daughter being expelled from 
the house in the middle of the night. In the long run nature will take its course—if not that night 
then the next, or the one after. Then the father's suspicions are ""justified,"" as he makes plain to the 
mother, who has stood by ""helplessly"" while all this went on. 
In general, however, ""Uproar"" may be played between any two people who are trying to avoid 
sexual intimacy. For example, it is a common terminal phase of ""Frigid Woman."" It is relatively 
rare between teen-age boys and their female relatives, because it is easier for teen-age boys to 
escape from the house in the evening than for other members of the family. At an earlier age 
brothers and sisters can set up effective barriers and partial satisfactions through physical combat, a 
pattern which has various motivations at different ages, and which in America is a semi-ritualistic 
form of ""Uproar"" sanctioned by television, pedagogic and pediatric authorities. In upper-class 
England it is (or was) considered bad form, and the corresponding energies are channeled into the 
well-regulated ""Uproar"" of the playing fields. 
Antithesis. The game is not as distasteful to the father as he might like to think, and it is generally 
the daughter who makes the antithetical move through an early, often premature or forced marriage. 
If it is psychologically possible, the mother can make the antithetical move by relinquishing her 

57

 
 
relative or absolute frigidity. The game may subside if the father finds an outside sexual interest, 
but that may lead to other complications. In die case of married couples, the antitheses are the same 
as for ""Frigid Woman"" or ""Frigid Man."" 
Under appropriate circumstances ""Uproar"" leads quite naturally into ""Courtroom.""

CHAPTER TEN 
Underworld Games 
WITH the infiltration of the ""helping"" professions into the courts, probation departments and 
correctional facilities, and with the increasing sophistication o£ criminologists and law enforcement 
officers, those concerned should be aware of the more common games prevalent in the underworld, 
both in prison and out of it. These include ""Cops and Robbers,"" ""How Do You Get Out of Here"" 
and ""Let's Pull a Fast One on Joey."" 

1 COPS AND ROBBERS 
Thesis. Because many criminals are cop-haters, they seem to get as much satisfaction from 
outwitting the police as from their criminal gains, often more. Their crimes, at the Adult level, are 
games played for the material rewards, the take; but at the Child level it is the thrill of the chase: 
the getaway and the cool-off. 
Curiously enough, the childhood prototype of ""Cops and Robbers"" is not cops and robbers but hide-
and-seek, in which the essential element is the chagrin of being found. Younger children readily 
betray this. If father finds them too easily, the chagrin is there without much fun. But father, if he is 
a good player, knows what to do; he holds off, whereupon the little boy gives him a clue by calling 
out, dropping something or banging. Thus he forces father to find him, but still shows chagrin; this 
time he has had more fun because of the increased suspense. If father gives up, the boy usually 
feels disappointed rather than victorious. Since the fun of being hidden was there, evidently that is 
not where the trouble lies, What he is disappointed about is not being caught. When his turn comes 
to hide, father knows he is not supposed to outwit the little boy for very one just enough to make it 
fun; and he is wise enough to look chagrined when he is caught. It soon becomes clear that being 
found is the necessary payoff. 
Hence hide-and-seek is not a mere pastime but a true game At the social level it is a battle of wits, 
and is most satisfying when the Adult of each player does his best; at the psychological level, 
however, it is set up like compulsive gambling, in which White's Adult has to lose in order for his 
Child to win. Not being caught is actually the antithesis. Among older children, one who finds an 
insoluble hiding place is regarded as not being a good sport, since he has spoiled the game, He has 
eliminated the Child element and turned the whole thing into an Adult procedure. He is no longer 
playing for fun. He is in the same class as the owner of a casino, or some professional criminals, 
who are really out for money rather than sport. 
There seem to be two distinctive types of habitual criminals: those who are in crime primarily for 
profit, and those who are in it primarily for the game—with a large group in between who can 
handle it either way. The ""compulsive winner,"" the big money-maker whose Child really does not 
want to be caught, rarely is, according to reports; he is an untouchable, for whom the fix is always 
in. The ""compulsive loser,"" on the other hand, who is playing ""Cops and Robbers"" (C&R), seldom 
does very well financially. The exceptions to this often seem to be due to luck rather than skill; in 
the long run even the lucky ones usually end up as their Child requires, squawking rather than 
riding high. 
The C&R player, with whom we are concerned here, in some ways resembles, the Alcoholic. He 
can shift roles from Robber to Cop and from' Cop to Robber. In some cases he may play the 
Parental Cop during the day and the Child Robber after dark. There is a Cop in many Robbers, and 
a Robber in many Cops. If the criminal ""reforms,"" he may play the role of Rescuer, becoming a 
social worker or a mission worker; but the Rescuer is Far less important in this game than in 
""Alcoholic."" Ordinarily, however, the player's role as Robber is his destiny, and each has his own 
modus operandi for getting caught. He may make it tough or easy for the Cops. 
The situation is similar with gamblers. At the social or sociological level a ""professional"" gambler 
is one whose chief interest in life is gambling. But at the psychological level there are two different 
kinds of people who are professional gamblers. There are those who spend their time gaming, i.e., 

59

 
 
playing with Fate, in whom the strength of the Adult's desire to win is exceeded only by the 
strength of the Child's need to lose. Then there are those who run gambling houses and actually do 
earn a living, usually a very good one, by providing opportunities for gamesters to play; they 
themselves are not playing, and try to avoid playing, although occasionally under certain conditions 
they will indulge themselves and enjoy it, just as a straight criminal may occasionally play a game 
of C&R, 
This throws light on why sociological and psychological studies of criminals have been generally 
ambiguous and unproductive: they are dealing with two different kinds of people who cannot be 
adequately differentiated in the ordinary theoretical or empirical frameworks. The same is true in 
studying gamblers. Transactional and game analyses offer an immediate solution for this. They 
remove the ambiguity by distinguishing transactionally, below the social level, between ""players"" 
and ""straight professionals."" 
Let us now turn from this general thesis to consider specific examples. Some burglars do their jobs 
without any waste motion. The ""Cops and Robbers"" burglar leaves his calling card in gratuitous 
acts of vandalism, such as spoiling valuable clothing with secretions and excretions. The straight 
bank robber, according to reports, takes every possible precaution to avoid violence; the C&R bank 
robber is only looking for an excuse to vent his anger. Like any professional, a straight criminal 
likes his jobs to be as clean as circumstances permit. The C&R criminal is compelled to blow off 
steam in the course of his work. The true professional is said never to operate until the fix is in; the 
player is willing to take on the law barehanded. Straight professionals are well aware, in their own 
way, of the game of C&R. If a gang member shows too much interest in the game, to the point of 
jeopardizing the job, and particularly if his need to be caught begins to show, they will take drastic 
measures to prevent a recurrence. Perhaps it is just because straight professionals are not playing 
C&R that they are so seldom caught, and hence so rarely studied sociologically, psychologically 
and psychiatrically; and this also applies to gamblers. Hence most of our clinical knowledge about 
criminals and gamblers refers to players rather than to straight professionals. 
Kleptomaniacs (as opposed to professional shoplifters) are examples of how widely trivial C&R is 
played. It is probable that a very large percentage of Occidentals, at least, have played C&R in 
fantasy, and that is what sells newspapers in our half of the world. This fantasy frequently occurs in 
the form of dreaming up the ""perfect murder,"" which is playing the hardest possible game and 
completely outwitting the cops. 
Variations of C&R are ""Auditors and Robbers,"" played by embezzlers with the same rules and the 
same payoff; Customs and Robbers,"" played by smugglers; etc. Of special interest is the criminal 
variation of ""Courtroom."" Despite all his precautions, the professional may occasionally be arrested 
and brought to trial. For him ""Courtroom"" is a procedure, which he carries out according to the 
instructions of his legal advisers. For the lawyers, if they are compulsive winners, ""Courtroom"" is 
essentially a game played with the jury in which the object is to win, not lose, and this is regarded 
as a constructive game by a large segment of society. 
Antithesis. This is the concern of qualified criminologists rather than psychiatrists. The police and 
judiciary apparatus are not antithetical, but are playing their roles in the game under the rules set up 
by society. 
One thing should be emphasized, however. Research workers in criminology may joke that some 
criminals behave as though they enjoyed the chase and 'wanted to be caught, or they may read the 
idea and agree in a deferential way. But they show little tendency to consider such an ""academic"" 
factor as decisive in their ""serious"" work. For one thing, there is no way to unmask this element 
through the standard methods of psychological research. The investigator must therefore either 
overlook a crucial point because he cannot work it with his research tools, or else change his tools. 
The fact is that those tools have so far not yielded one single solution to any problem in 
criminology. Researchers might therefore be better off discarding the old methods and tackling the 
problem freshly. Until C&R is accepted not merely as an interesting anomaly, but as the very heart 
of the matter in a significant percentage of cases, much research in criminology will continue to 
deal with trivialities, doctrines, peripheral issues or irrelevancies.

Existential: I've always been a loser, 

2 HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF HERE 
Thesis. The historical evidence is that those prisoners survive best who have their time structured 
by an activity, a pastime or a game. This is apparently well known to political police, who are said 
to break some prisoners down simply by keeping them inactive and in a state of social deprivation. 
The favored activity of solitary prisoners is reading or writing books, and the favored pastime is 
escape, some of whose practitioners, such as Casanova and Baron Trench, have become famous. 
The favored game is ""How Do You Get Out of Here1?"" (""Want Out""), which may also be played in 
state hospitals. It must be distinguished from the operation (see p. 48) of the same name, known as 
""Good Behavior."" An inmate who really wants to be free will find out how to comply with the 
authorities so as to be released at the earliest possible moment. Nowadays this may often be 
accomplished by playing a good game of ""Psychiatry,"" Group Therapy Type. The game of ""Want 
Out,"" however, is played by inmates or by patients whose Child does not want to get out. They 
simulate ""Good Behavior,"" but at the critical point they sabotage themselves so as not to be 
released. Thus in ""Good Behavior"" Parent, Adult and Child work together to be discharged; in 
""Want Out"" Parent and Adult go through the prescribed motions until the critical moment, when the 
Child, who is actually frightened at the prospect of venturing into the uncertain world, takes over 
and spoils the effect. ""Want Out"" was common in the late 1930's among recently arrived 
immigrants from Germany who became psychotic. They would improve and beg for release from 
the hospital; but as the day of liberation approached, their psychotic manifestations would recur. 
Antithesis. Both ""Good Behavior"" and ""Want Out"" are recognized by alert administrators and can 
be dealt with at die executive level. Beginners in group therapy, however, are often taken in. A 
competent group therapist, knowing these are die most frequent manipulations in psychiatrically 
oriented prisons, will be watching for them and will ferret them out at an early phase. Since ""Good 
Behavior"" is an honest operation, it may be treated as such, and there is no harm in discussing it 
openly. ""Want Out,"" on the other hand, requires active therapy if the frightened inmate is to be 
rehabilitated. 
Relatives. A close relative of ""Want Out"" is an operation called ""You've Got to Listen."" Here the 
inmate of an institution or the client of a social agency demands the right to make complaints. The 
complaints are often irrelevant. His main purpose is to assure himself that he will be listened to by 
the authorities. If they make the mistake of thinking that he expects the complaints to be acted on 
and cut him off as too demanding, there may be trouble. If they accede to his demands, he will 
increase them. If diey merely listen patiently and with signs of interest, the ""Got to Listen"" player 
will be satisfied and cooperative, and will not ask for anything more. The administrator must learn 
to distinguish ""You've Got to Listen"" from serious demands for remedial action.2 
""Bum Rap"" is another game that belongs in this family. A straight criminal may holler ""Bum Rap"" 
in a real effort to get out, in which case it is part of the procedure. The inmate who plays ""Bum 

61

 
 
 
Rap"" as a game, however, does not use it effectively to try to get out, since if he gets out be will no 
longer have much excuse to holler. 

3 LET'S PULL A FAST ONE ON JOEY  
Thesis. The prototype of this game is ""The Big Store,"" die big-time confidence game, but many 
small gifts and even the badger game are FOOJY. No man can be beaten at FOOJY unless he has 
larceny in his veins, because the first move is for Black to tell White that dumb-honest-old-Joey is 
just waiting to be taken. If White were completely honest, he would either back off or warn Joey, 
but he doesn't. Just as Joey is about to pay off, something goes wrong, and White finds that his 
investment is gone. Or in the badger game, just as Joey is about to be cuckolded, he happens to 
walk in. Then White, who was playing his own rules in his own honest way, finds that he has to 
play Joey's rules, and they hurt. 
Curiously enough, the mark is supposed to know the rules of FOOJY and stick to them. Honest 
squawking is a calculated risk of the con mob; they will not hold that against White, and he is even 
allowed a certain latitude in lying to the police to save his face. But if he goes too far and accuses 
them falsely of burglary, for example, that is cheating, and they resent it. On the other hand, there is 
little sympathy for a con man who gets into trouble by working a mark who is drunk, since this is 
improper procedure, and be should know better. The same applies if he is stupid enough to pick a 
mark with a sense of humor, since it is well known that such people cannot be trusted to play the 
straight man in FOOJY all the way down the line through the terminal game of ""Cops and 
Robbers."" Experienced con men are scared of marks who laugh after they have been taken. 
It should be noted that a practical joke is not a game of FOOJY, because in a practical joke Joey is 
the one who suffers, while in FOOJY Joey comes out on top, and White is the one who suffers. A 
practical joke is a pastime, while FOOJY is a game in which the joke is arranged to backfire. 
It is evident that FOOJY is a three- or four-handed game, with the police playing the fourth hand, 
and that it is related to ""Let's You and Him Fight.""

Thanks are due to Dr. Franklin Emst of the California Medical Facility at Vacaville, Mr. William 
Collins of the California Rehabilitation Center at Norco, and Mr. Laurence Means of the California 
Institution for Men at Tehachapi, for their continued interest in studying the game of ""Cops and 
Robbers"" and for their helpful discussions and criticisms.

1. Frederick Wiseman, in ""Psychiatry and the Law: Use and Abuse of Psychiatry in a Murder Case"" 
{American Journal of Psychiatry. 118: 289-299, 1961) gives a clear and tragic example of a hard 
form of ""Cops and Robbers."" It concerns a 23-year-old man who shot his fiancee and then turned 
himself in. This was not easy to arrange, since the police did not believe his story until he had 
repeated it four times. Later, he said: ""It just seemed to me that all my life I was bound to end up in 
the chair. If that was the way it was, that was the way it would be."" The author says it was farcical 
to expect a lay jury to understand the complex psychiatric testimony that was offered at the trial in 
technical jargon. In game terms, the central issue can be stated in words of no more than two 
syllables: A nine-year-old boy decides (for reasons clearly brought out at the trial) that he is bound 
to end up in the chair. He spends the rest of his life headed toward this goal, and using his girl 
friend as a target, in the end he sets himself up.

CHAPTER ELEVEN 
Consulting Room Games 

GAMES that are tenaciously played in the therapeutic situation are the most important ones for the 
professional game analyst to be aware of. They can be most readily studied first-hand in the 
consulting room. There are three types, according to the role of the agent: 
1. Games played by therapists and case workers: ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" and ""Psychiatry."" 
2. Games played by professionally trained people who ate patients in therapy groups, such as 
""Greenhouse."" 
3. Games played by lay patients and clients: ""Indigence,"" ""Peasant,"" ""Stupid"" and ""Wooden Leg."" 

1 GREENHOUSE 
Thesis. This is a variation of ""Psychiatry,"" which is played hardest by young social scientists, such 
as clinical psychologists. In the company of their colleagues these young people tend to play 
""Psychoanalysis,"" often in a jocular way, using such expressions as ""Your hostility is showing"" or 
""How mechanical can a defense mechanism get?"" This is usually a harmless and enjoyable pastime; 
it is a normal phase of their learning experience, and with a few originals in the group it can 
become quite amusing. (This writer's preference is, ""I see National Parapraxis Week is here again."") 
As patients in psychotherapy groups some of these people are apt to indulge in this mutual critique 
more seriously; but since it is not highly productive in that situation, it may have to be headed off 
by the therapist. The proceedings may then turn into a game of ""Greenhouse."" 
I here is a strong tendency for recent graduates to have an exaggerated respect for what they call 
""Genuine Feelings."" The expression of such a feeling may be preceded by an announcement that it 
is on its way. After the announcement, the feeling is described, or rather presented before die group, 
as though it were a rare flower which should be regarded with awe. The reactions of die other 
members are received very solemnly, and they take on the air of connoisseurs at a botanical garden. 
The problem seems to be, in the jargon of game analysis, whether this one is good enough to be 
exhibited in the National Feeling Show. A questioning intervention by the therapist may be 
strongly resented, as though be were some clumsy-fingered clod mauling the fragile petals of an 
exotic century plant. The therapist, naturally, feels that in order to understand the anatomy and 
physiology of a flower, it may be necessary to dissect it. 
Antithesis. The antithesis, which is crucial for therapeutic progress, is the irony of the above 
description. If this game is allowed to proceed, it may go on unchanged for years, after which the 
patient may feel that he has had a ""therapeutic experience"" during which he has ""expressed 
hostility"" and learned to ""face feelings"" in a way which gives him an advantage over less fortunate 
colleagues. Meanwhile very little of dynamic significance may have happened, and certainly the 
investment of time has not been used to maximum therapeutic advantage. 
The irony in the initial description is directed not against the patients but against their teachers and 
the cultural milieu which encourages such over-fastidiousness. If properly timed, a skeptical remark 
may successfully divorce them from foppish Parental influences and lead to a less self-conscious 
robustness in their transactions with each other. Instead of cultivating feelings in a kind of hothouse 
atmosphere, they may just let them grow naturally, to be plucked when they are ripe. 
The most obvious advantage of this game is the external psychological, since it avoids intimacy by 
setting up special conditions under which feelings may be expressed, and special restrictions on the 
responses of those present. 

2 I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU  
Thesis. This game may be played in any professional situation and is not confined to 
psychotherapists and welfare workers. However, it is found most commonly and in its most florid 
form among social workers with a certain type of training. The analysis of this game was clarified 

63

 
 
 
for the writer under curious circumstances. All the players at a poker game had folded except two, a 
research psychologist and a businessman. The businessman, who had a high hand, bet; the 
psychologist, who had an unbeatable one, raised. The businessman looked puzzled, whereupon the 
psychologist remarked facetiously: ""Don't be upset, I'm only trying to help you!"" The businessman 
hesitated, and finally put in his chips. The psychologist showed the winning band, whereupon the 
other threw down his cards in disgust. The others present then felt free to laugh at the psychologist's 
joke, and the loser remarked ruefully: ""You sure were helpful!"" The psychologist cast a knowing 
glance at the writer, implying that the joke had really been made at the expense of the psychiatric 
profession. It was at that moment that the structure of this game became clear. 
The worker or therapist, of whatever profession, gives some advice to a client or patient. The 
patient returns and reports that the suggestion did not have the desired effect. The worker shrugs off 
this failure with a feeling of resignation, and tries again. If be is more watchful, he may detect at 
this point a twinge of frustration, but he will try again anyway. Usually he feels little need to 
question his own motives, because he knows that many of his similarly trained colleagues do the 
same thing, and that he is following the ""correct"" procedure and will receive full support from his 
supervisors. 
If he runs up against a hard player, such as a hostile obsessional, he will find it more and more 
difficult to avoid feeling inadequate. Then he is in trouble, and the situation will slowly deteriorate. 
In the worst case, he may come up against an angry paranoid who will rush in one day in a rage, 
crying: ""Look what you made me do!"" Then his frustration will come strongly to the fore in the 
spoken or unspoken thought: ""But I was only trying to help you!"" His bewilderment at the 
ingratitude may cause him considerable suffering, indicating the complex motives underlying his 
own behavior. This bewilderment is the payoff. 
Legitimate helpers should not be confused with people who play ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" 
(ITHY). ""I think we can do something about it."" ""I know what to do,"" ""I was assigned to help you"" 
or ""My fee for helping you will be. . . ."" are different from ""I'm only trying to help you."" The first 
four, in good faith, represent Adult offers to put professional qualifications at the disposal of the 
distressed patient or client; ITHY has an ulterior motive which is more important than professional 
skill in determining the outcome. This motive is based on the position that people are ungrateful 
and disappointing. The prospect of success is alarming to the Parent of the professional and is an 
invitation to sabotage, because success would threaten the position. The ITHY player needs to be 
reassured that help will not be accepted no matter how strenuously it is offered. The client responds 
with ""Look How Hard I'm Trying"" or ""There's Nothing You Can Do to Help Me."" More flexible 
players can compromise: it is all right for people to accept help providing it takes diem a long time 
to do so. Hence therapists tend to feel apologetic for a quick result, since they know that some of 
their colleagues at staff meetings will be critical. At the opposite pole from hard ITHY players, 
such as are found among social workers, are good lawyers who help their clients without personal 
involvement or sentimentality. Here craftsmanship takes the place of covert strenuousness. 
Some schools of social work seem to be primarily academies for the training of professional ITHY 
players, and it is not easy for their graduates to desist from playing it. An example which may help 
to illustrate some of the foregoing points will be found in the description of the complementary 
game ""Indigence."" 
ITHY and its variants are easy to find in everyday life. It is played by family friends and relatives 
(e.g., ""I Can Get It For You Wholesale""), and by adults who do community work with children. It is 
a favorite among parents, and the complementary game played by the offspring is usually ""Look 
What You Made Me Do."" Socially it may be a variant of ""Schlemiel"" in which the damage is done 
while being helpful rather than impulsively; here the client is represented by a victim who may be 
playing ""Why Does This Always Happen To Me?"" or one of its variants. 
Antithesis. There are several devices available for the professional to handle an invitation to play 
this game, and his selection will depend on the state of the relationship between himself and the 
patient, particularly on the attitude of the patient's Child. 

64

 
1. The classical psychoanalytic antithesis is the most thoroughgoing and the most difficult for the 
patient to tolerate. The invitation is completely ignored. The patient then tries harder and harder. 
Eventually he falls into a state of despair, manifested by anger or depression, which is the 
characteristic sign that a game has been frustrated. This situation may lead to a useful confrontation. 
2. A more gentle (but not prim) confrontation may be attempted on the first invitation. The therapist 
states that he is the patient's therapist and not his manager. 
3. An even more gentle procedure is to introduce the patient into a therapy group, and let the other 
patients handle it. 
4. With an acutely disturbed patient it may be necessary to play along during the initial phase. 
These patients should be treated by a psychiatrist, who being a medical man, can prescribe both 
medications and some of the hygienic measures which are still valuable, even in this day of 
tranquilizers, in the treatment of such people. If the physician prescribes a hygienic regimen, which 
may include baths, exercise, rest periods, and regular meals along with medication, the patient (1) 
carries out the regimen and feels better C2) carries out the regimen scrupulously and complains that 
it does not help (3) mentions casually that he forgot to carry out the instructions or that he has 
abandoned the regimen because it was not doing any good. In the second and third case it is then up 
to the psychiatrist to decide whether the patient is amenable to game analysis at that point, or 
whether some other form of treatment is indicated to prepare him for later psychotherapy. The 
relationship between the adequacy of die regimen and the patient's tendency to play games with it 
should be carefully evaluated by the psychiatrist before he decides how to proceed next. 
For the patient, on the other hand, the antithesis is, ""Don't tell me what to do to help myself, I'll tell 
you what to do to help me."" If the therapist is known to be a Schlemiel, the correct antithesis for the 
patient to use is, ""Don't help me, help him."" But serious players of ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" 
are generally lacking in a sense of humor. Antithetical moves on the part of a patient are usually 
unfavorably received, and may result in the therapist's lifelong enmity. In everyday life such moves 
should not be initiated unless one is prepared to carry them through ruthlessly and take the 
consequences. For example, spuming a relative who ""Can Get It For You Wholesale"" may cause 
serious domestic complications.

Existential—All people are ungrateful. 

3 INDIGENCE 
Thesis. The thesis of this game is best stated by Henry Miller in The Colossus of Maroussi: ""The 
event must have taken place during the year when I was looking for a job without the slightest 
intention of taking one. It reminded me that, desperate as I thought myself to be, I bad not even 
bothered to look through the columns of the want ads."" This game is one of the complements of 
""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" (ITHY) as it is played by social workers who earn their living by it, 
""Indigence"" is played just as professionally by the client who earns his living in this manner. The 
writer's own experience with ""Indigence"" is limited, but the following account by one of his most 
accomplished students illustrates the nature of this game and its place in our society. 

65

 
 
 
Miss Black was a social worker in a welfare agency whose avowed purpose, for which it received a 
government subsidy, was the economic rehabilitation of indigents—which in effect meant getting 
them to find and retain gainful employment. The clients of this agency were continually making 
progress,"" according to official reports, but very few of them were actually ""rehabilitated."" This 
was understandable, it was claimed, because most of them had been welfare clients for several 
years, going from agency to agency and sometimes being involved with five or s& agencies at a 
time, so that it was evident that they were ""difficult cases."" 
Miss Black, from her training in game analysis, soon realized that the staff of her agency was 
playing a consistent game of ITHY, and wondered how the clients were responding to this. In order 
to check, she asked her own clients from week to week how many job opportunities they had 
actually investigated. She was interested to discover that although they were theoretically supposed 
to be looking assiduously for work from day to day, actually they devoted very little effort to this, 
and sometimes the token efforts they did make had an ironic quality. For example, one man said 
that he answered at least one advertisement a day looking for work. ""What kind of work?"" she 
inquired. He said he wanted to go into sales work. ""Is that the only kind of ad you answer?"" she 
asked. He- said that it was, but it was too bad that- he was a stutterer, as that held him back from 
his chosen career. About this time it came to the attention of her supervisor that she was asking 
these questions, and she was reprimanded for putting ""undue pressure"" on her clients. 
Miss Black decided nevertheless to go ahead and rehabilitate some of them. She selected those who 
were able-bodied and did not seem to have a valid reason to continue to receive welfare funds. 
With this selected group, she talked over the games ITHY and ""Indigence."" When they were 
willing to concede the point, she said that unless they found jobs she was going to cut them off 
from welfare funds and refer them to a different kind of agency. Several of them almost 
immediately found employment, some for the first time in years. But they were indignant at her 
attitude, and some of them wrote letters to her supervisor complaining about it. The supervisor 
called her in and reprimanded her even more severely, on the ground that although her former 
clients were working, they were not ""really rehabilitated."" The supervisor indicated that there was 
some question whether they would retain Miss Black in the agency. Miss Black, as much as she 
dared without further jeopardizing her position, tactfully tried to elicit what would constitute ""really 
rehabilitated"" in the agency's opinion. This was not clarified. She was only told that she was 
""putting undue pressure"" on people, and the fact that they were supporting their families for the first 
time in years was in no way to her credit. 
Because she needed her job and was now in danger of losing it, some of her friends tried to help. 
The respected head of a psychiatric clinic wrote to the supervisor, stating that he had heard Miss 
Black had done some particularly effective work with welfare clients, and asking whether she 
might discuss her findings at a staff conference at his clinic. The supervisor refused permission. 
In this case the rules of ""Indigence"" were set up by the agency to complement the local rules of 
ITHY. There was a tacit agreement between the worker and the client which read as follows: 
W. ""I'll try to help you (providing you don't get better)."" B. ""I'll look for employment (providing I 
don't have to find any)."" 
If a client broke the agreement by getting better, the agency lost a client, and the client lost his 
welfare benefits, and both felt penalized. If a worker like Miss Black broke the agreement by 
making the client actually find work, the agency was penalized by the client's complaints, which 
might come to the attention of higher authorities, while again the client lost his welfare benefits. 
As long as both obeyed the implicit rules, both got what they wanted. The client received his 
benefits and soon learned what the agency wanted in return: an opportunity to ""reach out"" (as part 
of ITHY) plus ""clinical material"" (to present at ""client-centered"" staff conferences). 
The client was glad to comply with these demands, which gave him as much pleasure as it did the 
agency. Thus they got along well together, and neither felt any desire to terminate such a satisfying 
relationship. Miss Black, in effect, ""reached in"" instead of ""reaching out,"" and proposed a 
""community-centered"" staff conference instead of a ""client-centered"" one; and this disturbed all the 

66

 
others concerned in spite of the fact that she was thus only complying with the stated intent of the 
regulations. 
Two things should be noted here. First, ""Indigence"" as a game rather than a condition due to 
physical, mental, or economic disability, is played by only a limited percentage of welfare clients. 
Second, it will only be supported by social workers who are trained to play ITHY. It will not be 
well-tolerated by other workers. 
Allied games are ""Veteran"" and ""Clinic."" ""Veteran"" displays the same symbiotic relationship, this 
time between the Veterans Administration, allied organizations, and a certain number of 
""professional veterans"" who share die legitimate privileges of disabled ex-servicemen. ""Clinic"" is 
played by a certain percentage of those who attend the out-patient departments of large hospitals. 
Unlike those who play ""Indigent"" or ""Veteran,"" patients who -play ""Clinic"" do not receive financial 
remuneration, but get other advantages. They serve a useful social purpose, since they are willing to 
cooperate in the training of medical personnel and in studies of disease processes. From this they 
may get a legitimate Adult satisfaction not available to players of ""Indigence"" and ""Veteran."" 
Antithesis. Antithesis, if indicated, consists in withholding the benefits. Here the risk is not 
primarily from the player himself, as in most other games, but from this game being culturally 
syntonic and fostered by the complementary ITHY players. The threat comes from professional 
colleagues and the aroused public, government agencies and protective unions. The complaints 
which follow an exhibition of anti-""Indigence"" may lead to a loud outcry of ""Yes, Yes, How About 
That?"" which may be regarded as a healthy, constructive operation or pastime, even if it 
occasionally discourages candidness. In fact, the whole American political system of democratic 
freedoms is based on a license (not available under many other forms of government) to ask that 
question. Without such a license, humanitarian social progress becomes seriously impeded. 

4 PEASANT 
Thesis. The prototype peasant is the arthritic Bulgarian villager who sells her only cow to raise 
money to go to the university clinic in Sofia. There the professor examines her and finds her case 
so interesting that he presents her in a clinical demonstration to the medical students. He outlines 
not only the pathology, symptoms and diagnosis, but also the treatment. This procedure fills Her 
with awe. Before she leaves, the professor gives her a prescription and explains the treatment in 
more detail. She is overcome with admiration for his learning and says the Bulgarian equivalent of, 
""Gee, you're wonderful, Professor!"" However, she never has the prescription filled. First, there is 
no apothecary in her village; second, even if there were, she would never let such a valuable piece 
of paper out of her hands. Nor does she have the facilities for carrying out the rest of the treatment, 
such as diet, hydrotherapy and so on. She lives on, crippled as before, but happy now because she 
can tell everyone about the wonderful treatment prescribed for her by the great professor in Sofia, 
to whom she expresses her gratitude every night in her prayers. 
Years later, the Professor, in an unhappy frame of mind, happens to pass through the village on his 
way to see a wealthy but demanding patient. He remembers the peasant when she rushes out to kiss 
his hand and remind him of the marvelous regimen he put her on so long ago. He accepts her 
homage graciously, and is particularly gratified when she tells him how much good the treatment 
has done. In fact he is so carried away that he fails to notice that she limps as badly as ever. 
Socially ""Peasant"" is played in an innocent and a dissembled form, both with the motto, ""Gee 
you're wonderful, Mr. Murgatroyd!"" (GYWM). In the innocent form, Murgatroyd is wonderful. He 
is a celebrated poet, painter, philanthropist or scientist, and naive young women frequently travel a 
long way in the hope of meeting him so that they can sit adoringly at his feet and romanticize his 
imperfections. A more sophisticated woman who sets out deliberately to have an affair or a 
marriage with such a man, whom she sincerely admires and appreciates, may be fully aware of his 
weaknesses. She may even exploit them in order to get what she wants. With these two types of 
women, the game arises from the romanticizing or exploiting of the imperfections, while the 

67

 
 
innocence lies in their genuine respect for his accomplishments, which they are able to evaluate 
correctly. 
In the dissembled form, Murgatroyd may or may not be wonderful, but he comes up against a 
woman incapable of appreciating him in the best sense, in any case; perhaps she is a high-class 
prostitute. She plays ""Little Old Me"" and uses GYWM as sheer flattery to attain her own ends. 
Underneath she is either bewildered by him or laughing at him. But she does not care about him; 
what she wants are the perquisites that go with him. 
Clinically ""Peasant"" is played in two similar forms, with the motto, ""Gee you're wonderful, 
Professor!"" (GYWP). In the innocent form the patient may stay well as long as she can believe in 
GYWP, which places an obligation on the therapist to be well-behaved both in public and in private 
life. In the dissembled form the patient hopes the therapist will go along with her GYWP and think: 
""You're uncommonly perceptive"" (YUP). Once she has him in this position, she can make him look 
foolish and then move on to another therapist; if he cannot be so easily beguiled, he may actually 
be able to help her. 
The simplest way for the patient to win GYWP is not to get better. If she is more malicious, she 
may take more positive steps to make the therapist look foolish. One woman played GYWP with 
her psychiatrist without any alleviation of symptoms; she finally left him with many salaams and 
apologies. She then went to her revered clergyman for help and played GYWP with him. After a 
few weeks she seduced him into a game of second-degree ""Rapo."" She then told her neighbor 
confidentially over the back fence how disappointed she was that so fine a man as Rev. Black could, 
in a moment of weakness, make a pass at an innocent and unattractive women like herself. 
Knowing his wife, she could forgive him, of course, but nevertheless, etc. This confidence just 
slipped out inadvertently, and it was only afterward that she remembered ""to her horror"" that the 
neighbor was an elder in the church. With her psychiatrist she won by not getting better; with her 
clergyman she won by seducing him, although she was reluctant to admit it. But a second 
psychiatrist introduced her to a therapy group where she could not maneuver as she had before. 
Then, with no GYWP and YUP to fill in her therapeutic time, she began to examine her behavior 
more closely and with the help of the group was able to give up both her games—GYWP and 
""Rapo."" 
Antithesis. The therapist must first decide whether the game is played innocently and hence should 
be allowed to continue for the benefit of the patient until her Adult is sufficiently well-established 
to risk countermeasures. If it is not innocent, the countermeasures may be taken at the first 
appropriate opportunity, after the patient has been sufficiently well prepared so that she will be able 
to understand what happens. The therapist then steadfastly refuses to give advice, and when the 
patient begins to protest, he makes it clear that this is not merely ""Poker-Faced Psychiatry"" but a 
well-thought-out policy. In due time his refusals may either enrage the patient or precipitate acute 
anxiety symptoms. The next step depends on the malignancy of the patient's condition. If she is too 
upset, her acute reactions should be dealt with by appropriate psychiatric or analytic procedures to 
re-establish the therapeutic situation. The first goal, in the dissembled form, is to split off the Adult 
from the hypocritical Child so that the game can be analyzed. 
In social situations, intimate entanglements with innocent GYWM players should be avoided, as 
any intelligent actor's agent will impress upon his clients. On the other hand, women who play 
dissembled GYWM are sometimes interesting and intelligent if they can be de-GYWMed, and may 
turn out to be quite a delightful addition to the family social circle. 

5 PSYCHIATRY 
Thesis. Psychiatry as a procedure must be distinguished from ""Psychiatry"" as a game. According to 
the available evidence, presented in proper clinical form in scientific publications, the following 
approaches, among others, are of value in treating psychiatric conditions: shock therapy, hypnosis, 
drugs, psychoanalysis, orthopsychiatry and group therapy. There are others which are less 
commonly used and will not be discussed here. Any of these can be used in the game of 

68

 
 
""Psychiatry,"" which is based on the position ""I am a healer,"" supported by a diploma: ""It says here I 
am a healer."" It will be noted that in any case this is a constructive, benevolent position, and that 
people who play ""Psychiatry"" can do a great deal of good, providing they are professionally trained. 
It is likely, however, that there will be some gain in therapeutic results if therapeutic ardor is 
moderated. The antithesis was best expressed long ago by Ambroise Par£, who said in effect: ""I 
treat them, but God cures them."" Every medical student learns about this dictum, along with others 
such as primium non nocere, and phrases such as vis medicatrix naturae. Nonmedical therapists, 
however, are not likely to be exposed -to these ancient cautions. The position ""I am a healer 
because it says here that I am a healer"" is likely to be an impairment, and may be replaced to 
advantage with something like: ""I will apply what therapeutic procedures I have learned in the hope 
that they will be of some benefit."" This avoids the possibility of games based on: ""Since I am a 
healer, if you don't get better it's your fault"" (e.g., ""I'm Only Trying To Help You"" or ""Since you're 
a healer, I'll get better for you"" (e.g., ""Peasant""). All of this, of course, is known in principle to 
every conscientious therapist. Certainly every therapist who has ever presented a case at a reputable 
clinic has been made aware of it. Conversely, a good clinic may be defined as one which makes its 
therapists aware of these things. 
On the other side, the game of ""Psychiatry"" is more apt to crop up with patients who have 
previously been treated by less competent therapists. A few patients, for example, carefully pick 
weak psychoanalysts, moving from one to another, demonstrating that they cannot be cured and 
meanwhile learning to play a sharper and sharper game of ""Psychiatry""; eventually it becomes 
difficult for even a first-rate clinician to separate the wheat from the chaff. The duplex transaction 
on the patient's side is: 
Adult: ""I am coming to be cured."" 
Child: ""You will never cure me, but you will teach me to be a better neurotic (play a better game of 
'Psychiatry')."" 
""Mental Health"" is played similarly; here the Adult statement is, ""Everything will get better if I 
apply the principles of mental health which I have read and heard about."" One patient learned to 
play ""Psychiatry"" from one therapist, ""Mental Health"" from another, and then as a result of still 
another effort began to play a pretty good game of ""Transactional Analysis."" When this was frankly 
discussed with her, she agreed to stop playing ""Mental Health,"" but requested that she be allowed to 
continue to play ""Psychiatry"" because it made her feel comfortable. The transactional psychiatrist 
agreed. She continued, therefore, for several months to recite her dreams and her interpretations of 
them at weekly intervals. Finally, partly out of plain gratitude, perhaps, she decided that it might be 
interesting to find out what was really the matter with her. She became seriously interested in 
transactional analysis, with good results. 
A variant of ""Psychiatry"" is ""Archaeology"" (title by courtesy of Dr. Norman Reider of San 
Francisco), in which the patient takes the position that if she can only find out who had the button, 
so to speak, everything will suddenly be all right. This results in a continual rumination over 
childhood happenings. Sometimes the therapist may he beguiled into a game of ""Critique,"" in 
which the patient describes her feelings in various situations and the therapist tells her what is 
wrong with them. ""Self-Expression,"" which is a common game in some therapy groups, is based on 
the dogma ""Feelings are Good."" A patient who uses vulgar expletives, for example, may be 
applauded or at least implicitly lauded. A sophisticated group, however, will soon spot this as a 
game. 
Some members of therapy groups become quite adept at picking out games of ""Psychiatry,"" and 
will soon let a new patient know if they think he is playing ""Psychiatry"" or ""Transactional 
Analysis"" instead of using group procedures to obtain legitimate insight. A woman who transferred 
from a Self-Expression group in one city to a more sophisticated group in another city told a story 
about an incestuous relationship in her childhood. Instead of the awe which she had come to expect 
whenever she told this oft-repeated tale, she was greeted with indifference, whereupon she became 
enraged. She was astonished to discover that the new group was more interested in her transactional 
anger than in her historical incest, and in irate tones she hurled what apparently in her mind was the 

69

 
ultimate insult: she accused them of not being Freudian. Freud, himself, of course, took 
psychoanalysis more seriously, and avoided making a game of it by saying that he himself was not 
a Freudian. 
Recently unmasked is a new variant of ""Psychiatry"" called ""Tell Me This,"" somewhat similar to the 
party pastime ""Twenty Questions."" White relates a dream or an incident, and the other members, 
often including die therapist, then attempt to interpret it by asking pertinent questions. As long as 
White answers the questions, each member continues his inquiries until he finds a question White 
cannot answer. Then Black sits back with a knowing look which says: ""Aha! If you could answer 
that one, you would certainly get better, so I have done my part."" (This is a distant relative of ""Why 
Don't You—Yes But""). Some therapy groups are based almost entirely on this game, and may go 
on for years with only minimal change or progress. ""Tell Me This"" allows much latitude to White 
(the patient) who, for example, can play along with it by feeling ineffectual; or he can counter it by 
answering all the questions offered, in which case the anger and dismay of the other players soon 
becomes manifest, since he is throwing back at them, ""I've answered all your questions and you 
haven't cured me, so what does that make you?"" ""Tell Me This"" is also played in schoolrooms, 
where the pupils know that the ""right"" answer to an open-ended question asked by a certain type of 
teacher is not to be found by processing the factual data, but by guessing or outguessing which of 
several possible answers will make the teacher happy. A pedantic variant occurs in teaching ancient 
Greek; the teacher always has the upper hand over the pupil, and can make him look stupid and 
prove it in print by pointing to some obscure feature of the text. This is also often played in 
teaching Hebrew. 

6 STUPID 
Thesis. In its milder form, the thesis of ""Stupid"" is, ""I laugh with you at my own clumsiness and 
stupidity."" Seriously disturbed people, however, may play it in a sullen way which says, ""I am 
stupid, that's the way I am, so do me something."" Both forms are played from a depressive position. 
""Stupid"" must be distinguished from ""Schlemiel,"" where the position is more aggressive, and the 
clumsiness is a bid for forgiveness. It must also be distinguished from ""Clown,"" which is not a 
game but a pastime which reinforces the position ""I am cute and harmless."" The critical transaction 
in ""Stupid"" is for White to make Black call him stupid or respond as though he were stupid. Hence 
White acts like a Schlemiel but does not ask for forgiveness; in fact forgiveness makes him uneasy, 
because it threatens his position. Or he behaves clownishly, but with no implication that he is 
kidding; he wants his behavior to be taken seriously, as evidence of real stupidity. There is 
considerable external gain, since the less White learns, the more effectively he can play. Hence at 
school he need not study, and at work he need not go out of his way to learn anything that might 
lead to advancement. He has known from an early age that everyone will be satisfied with him as 
long as he is stupid, despite any expressions to the contrary. People are surprised when in time of 
stress, if he decides to come through, it turns out that he is not stupid at all—any more than is the 
""stupid"" younger son in the fairy tale. 
Antithesis. The antithesis of the milder form is simple. By not playing, by not laughing at the 
clumsiness or railing at the stupidity, the anti-""Stupid"" player will make a friend for life. One of the 
subtleties is that this game is often played by cyclothymic or manic-depressive personalities. When 
such people are euphoric, it seems as though they really want their associates to join in their 
laughter at themselves. It is often hard not to, for they give the impression that they will resent an 
abstainer—which in a way they do, since he threatens their position and spoils the game. But when 
they are depressed, and their resentment against those who laughed with or at them comes into the 
open, the abstainer knows that he has acted correctly. He may be the only one the patient is willing 
to have in the room or talk to when he is withdrawn, and all the former ""friends"" who enjoyed the 
game are now treated as enemies. 
It is no use telling White that he is not really stupid. He may actually be of quite limited 
intelligence and well aware of it, which is how the game got started in the first place. There may be 

70

 
 
special areas, however, in which he is superior: often psychological insight is one. It does no harm 
to show whatever respect is deserved for such aptitudes, but this is different from clumsy attempts 
at ""reassurance."" The latter may give him the bitter satisfaction of realizing that other people are 
even more stupid than he, but this is small consolation. Such ""reassurance"" is certainly not the most 
intelligent therapeutic procedure; usually it is a move in a game of ""I'm Only Trying to Help You."" 
The antithesis of ""Stupid"" is not to substitute another game, but simply to refrain from playing 
""Stupid."" 
The antithesis of the sullen form is a more complicated problem, because the sullen player is trying 
to provoke not laughter or derision but helplessness or exasperation, which he is well equipped to 
handle in accordance with his challenge ""So do me something."" Thus he wins either way. If Black 
does nothing, it is because he feels helpless, and if he does something, it is because he is 
exasperated. Hence these people are prone also to play ""Why Don't You—Yes But,"" from which 
they can get the same satisfactions in milder form. There is no easy solution in this case, nor is 
there likely to be one forthcoming until the psychodynamics of this game are more clearly 
understood. 

7 WOODEN LEG 
Thesis. The most dramatic form of ""Wooden Leg"" is ""The Plea of Insanity."" This may be translated 
into transactional terms as follows: ""What do you expect of someone as emotionally disturbed as I 
am—that I would refrain from killing people?"" To which the jury is asked to reply: ""Certainly not, 
we would hardly impose that restriction on you!"" ""The Plea of Insanity,"" played as a legal game, is 
acceptable to American culture and is different from the almost universally respected principle that 
an individual may be suffering from a psychosis so profound that no reasonable person would 
expect him to be responsible for his actions. In Japan drunkenness, and in Russia war-time military 
service, are accepted as excuses for evading responsibility for all kinds of outrageous behavior 
(according to this writer's information). 
The thesis of ""Wooden Leg"" is, ""What do you expect of a man with a wooden leg?"" Put that way, 
of course, no one would expect anything of a man with a wooden leg except that he should steer his 
own wheel chair. On the other hand, during World War II there was a man with a wooden leg who 
used to give demonstrations of jitterbug dancing, and very competent jitterbug dancing, at Army 
Hospital amputation centers. There are blind men who practice law and hold political offices (one 
such is currently mayor of the writer's home town), deaf men who practice psychiatry and handless 
men who can use a typewriter. 
As long as someone with a real, exaggerated or even imaginary disability is content with his lot, 
perhaps no one should interfere. But the moment he presents himself for psychiatric treatment, the 
question arises if he is using his life to his own best advantage, and if he can rise above his 
disability. In this country the therapist will be working in opposition to a large mass of educated 
public opinion. Even the close relatives of the patient who complained most loudly about the 
inconveniences caused by his infirmity, may eventually rum on the therapist if the patient makes 
definitive progress. This is readily understandable to a game analyst, but it makes his task no less 
difficult. All the people who were playing ""I'm Only Trying to Help You"" are threatened by the 
impending disruption of the game if the patient shows signs of striking out on his own, and 
sometimes they use almost incredible measures to terminate the treatment. 
Both sides are illustrated by the case of the stuttering client of Miss Black's, mentioned in the 
discussion of the game ""Indigence."" This man played a classical form of ""Wooden Leg."" He was 
unable to find employment, which he correctly attributed to the fact that he was a stutterer, since 
the only career that interested him, he said, was that of salesman. As a free citizen he had a right to 
seek employment in whatever field he chose, but as a stutterer, his choice raised some question as 
to the purity of his motives. The reaction of the helpful agency when Miss Black attempted to break 
up this game was very unfavorable to her. 

71

 
 
""Wooden Leg"" is especially pernicious in clinical practice, because the patient may find a therapist 
who plays the same game with the same plea, so that progress is impossible. This is relatively easy 
to arrange in the case of the ""Ideological Plea,"" ""What do you expect of a man who lives in a 
society like ours?"" One patient combined this with the ""Psychosomatic Plea,"" ""What do you expect 
of a man with psychosomatic symptoms?"" He found a succession of therapists who would accept 
one plea but not the other, so that none of them either made him feel comfortable in his current 
position by accepting both pleas, or budged him from it by rejecting both. Thus he proved that 
psychiatry couldn't help people. 
Some of the pleas which patients use to excuse symptomatic behavior are colds, head injuries, 
situational stress, the stress of modem living, American culture and the economic system. A literate 
player has no difficulty in finding authorities to support him. ""I drink because I'm Irish."" ""This 
wouldn't happen if I lived in Russia or Tahiti."" The fact is that patients in mental hospitals in Russia 
and Tahiti are very similar to those in American state hospitals.1 Special pleas of ""If It Weren't For 
Them"" or ""They Let Me Down"" should always be evaluated very carefully in clinical practice—and 
also in social research projects. 
Slightly more sophisticated are such pleas as: What do you expect of a man who (a) comes from a 
broken home (b) is neurotic (c) is in analysis or (d) is suffering from a disease known as alcoholism? 
These are topped by, ""If I stop doing this I won't be able to analyze it, and then I'll never get better."" 
The obverse of ""Wooden Leg"" is ""Rickshaw,"" with the thesis, ""If they only had (rickshaws) 
(duckbill platypuses) (girls who spoke ancient Egyptian) around this town, I never would have got 
into this mess."" 
Antithesis. Anti-""Wooden Leg"" is not difficult if the therapist can distinguish clearly between his 
own Parent and Adult, and if the therapeutic aim is explicitly understood 
by both parties. 
On the Parental side, he can be either a ""good"" Parent or a ""harsh"" one. As a ""good"" Parent he can 
accept the patient's plea, especially if it fits in with his own viewpoints, perhaps with the 
rationalization that people are not responsible for their actions until they have completed their 
therapy. As a ""harsh"" Parent he can reject the plea and engage in a contest of wills with the patient. 
Both of these attitudes are already Familiar to the ""Wooden Leg"" player, and he knows how to 
extract the maximum satisfactions from each of them. 
As an Adult, the therapist declines both of these opportunities. When the patient asks, ""What do 
you expect of a neurotic?"" (or whatever plea he is using at the moment) the reply is, ""I don't expect 
anything. The question is, what do you expect of yourself?"" The only demand he makes is that the 
patient give a serious answer to this question, and the only concession he makes is to allow the 
patient a reasonable length of time to answer it: anywhere from six weeks to six months, depending 
on the relationship between them and the patient's previous preparation.

CHAPTER TWELVE 
Good Games 
THE psychiatrist, who is in the best and perhaps the only position to study games adequately, 
unfortunately deals almost entirely with people whose games have led them into difficulties. This 
means that die games which are offered for clinical investigation are all in some sense ""bad"" ones. 
And since by definition games are based on ulterior transactions, they must all have some element 
of exploitation. For these two reasons, practical on the one hand and theoretical on the other, the 
search for ""good"" games becomes a difficult quest. A ""good"" game might be described as one 
whose social contribution outweighs the complexity of its motivations, particularly if the player has 
come to terms with those motivations without futility or cynicism. That is, a ""good"" game would be 
one which contributes both to the well-being of the other players and to the unfolding of the one 
who is ""it."" Since even under the best forms of social action and organization a large proportion of 
time has to be spent in playing games, the search for ""good"" ones must be assiduously pursued. 
Several examples are offered here, but they are admittedly deficient in both number and quality. 
They include ""Busman's Holiday,"" ""Cavalier,"" ""Happy to Help,"" ""Homely Sage"" and ""They'll Be 
Glad They Knew Me."" 

1 BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY 
Thesis. Strictly speaking, this is a pastime rather than a game, and evidently a constructive one for 
all concerned. An American mail carrier goes to Tokyo to help a Japanese postman on his rounds, 
or an American ear-nose-and-throat specialist who spends his holiday working in a Haitian hospital, 
will very likely feel just as refreshed and have just as good stories to tell as if he had gone hunting 
in Africa or spent the time driving through transcontinental highway traffic. The Peace Corps has 
now given official sanction to Busman's Holiday. 
""Busman's Holiday"" becomes a game, however, if the work is secondary to some ulterior motive 
and is undertaken merely as a show in order to accomplish something else. Even under those 
circumstances, however, it still keeps its constructive quality and is one of the more commendable 
covers for other activities (which may also be constructive). 

2 CAVALIER 
Thesis. This is a game played by men who are not under sexual pressure—occasionally by younger 
men who have a satisfactory marriage or liaison, more often by older men who are gracefully 
resigned to monogamy or celibacy- Upon encountering a suitable female subject, White takes every 
opportunity to remark upon her good qualities, never transgressing the limits appropriate to her 
station in life, the immediate social situation and the requirements of good taste. But within those 
limits he allows full play to his creativity, enthusiasm and originality. The object is not to seduce 
but to exhibit his virtuosity in the art of effective compliment. The internal social advantage lies in 
the pleasure given to the woman by this innocent artistry, and by her responsive appreciation of 
White's skill. In suitable cases, where both are aware of the nature of the game, it may be stretched 
with increasing delight on both sides, to the point of extravagance. A man of the world, of course, 
will know when to stop, and will not continue beyond the point at which he ceases to amuse (out of 
consideration for her) or where the quality of his offerings begins to deteriorate (out of 
consideration for his own pride of craftsmanship). ""Cavalier"" is played for its external social 
advantages in the case of poets, who are as much, or more, interested in the appreciation of 
qualified critics and the public at large as they are in the response of the lady who inspired them. 
The Europeans in romance, and the British in poetry, seem always to have been more adept at this 
game than the Americans. In our country it has fallen largely into the hands of the Fruit Stand 
school of poetry: your eyes are like avocados, your lips like cucumbers, etc. ""Cavalier,"" Fruit Stand 

73

 
 
 
Type, can hardly compare in elegance with the productions of Herrick and Lovelace, or even with 
the cynical but imaginative works of Rochester, Roscommon and 
Dorset. 
Antithesis. It takes some sophistication for the woman to play her part well, and a great deal of 
sulkiness or stupidity for her to refuse to play it at all. The proper complement is a variant of ""Gee 
You're Wonderful Mr. Murgatroyd"" (GYWM): namely, ""I Admire Your Productions, Mr. M."" If 
the woman is mechanical or unperceptive, she may respond with plain GYWM, but that misses the 
point: what White is offering for appreciation is not himself, but his poetry. The brutal antithesis 
from a sulky woman is to play Second-Degree ""Rapo"" (""Buzz Off, Buster""). Third-Degree ""Rapo,"" 
which could conceivably occur, would of course be an unspeakably vile response under the 
circumstances. If the woman is merely stupid, she will play First-Degree ""Rapo,"" taking the 
compliments to feed her vanity and neglecting to appreciate Whites creative efforts and abilities. In 
general, the game is spoiled if the woman treats it as an attempt at seduction rather than as a literary 
exhibition. 
Relatives. ""Cavalier"" being a game, it must be distinguished from the operations and procedures 
carried on during a straightforward courtship, which are simple transactions without ulterior motive. 
The female counterpart of Cavalier"" may be conveniently called ""Blarney,"" since it is often played 
by gallant Irish ladies in their sunset years. 

PARTIAL ANALYSIS  
Aim: Mutual admiration.  
Roles: Poet, Appreciative subject.  
Social Paradigm: Adult-Adult. 
Adult (male): ""See how good I can make you feel."" 
Adult (female): ""My, but you make me feel good."" Psychological Paradigm: 
Child (male): ""See what phrases I can create."" Child (female): ""My, but you're creative."" 
Advantages: (1) Internal Psychological—creativity and reassurance of attractiveness. (2) External 
Psychological —avoids rejection for unnecessary sexual advances. (3) Internal Social—""Cavalier."" 
(4) External Social—these may be resigned. (5) Biological—mutual stroking. (6) Existential— I 
can live gracefully. 

3 HAPPY TO HELP 
Thesis. White is consistently helpful to other people, with some ulterior motive. He may be doing 
penance For past wickedness, covering up for present wickedness, making friends in order to 
exploit them later or seeking prestige. But whoever questions his motives must also give him credit 
for his actions. After all, people can cover up for past wickedness by becoming more wicked, 
exploit people by fear rather than generosity and seek prestige for evil ways instead of good ones. 
Some philanthropists are more interested in competition than in benevolence: ""I gave more money 
(works of art, acres of land) than you did."" Again, if their motives are questioned, they must 
nevertheless be given credit for competing in a constructive way, since there are so many people 
who compete destructively. Most people (or peoples) who play ""Happy to Help"" have both friends 
and enemies, both perhaps justified in their feelings. Their enemies attack their motives and 
minimize their actions, while their friends are grateful for their actions and minimize their motives. 
Therefore so-called ""objective"" discussions of this game are practically nonexistent. People who 
claim to be neutral soon show which side they are neutral on. 
This game, as an exploitative maneuver, is the basis for a large proportion of ""public relations"" in 
America. But the customers are glad to become involved, and it is perhaps the most pleasant and 
constructive of the commercial games. In another connection, one of its most reprehensible forms is 
a three-handed family game in which the mother and father compete for the affection of their 
offspring. But even here, it should be noted, the choice of ""Happy to Help"" removes some of the 

74

 
 
 
discredit, since there are so many unpleasant ways of competing available—for example, ""Mommy 
is sicker than daddy,"" or ""Why do you love him more than you love me?"" 

4 HOMELY SAGE 
Thesis. This is properly a script rather than a game, but it has gamelike aspects. A well-educated 
and sophisticated man learns as much as he can about all sorts of things besides his own business. 
When he reaches retirement age, he moves from the big city where he held a responsible position to 
a small town. There it soon becomes known that people can go to him with their problems of 
whatever kind, from a knock in the engine to a senile relative, and that he will help them himself if 
he is competent or else refer them to qualified experts. Thus he soon finds his place in his new 
environment as a ""Homely Sage,"" making no pretenses, hut always willing to listen. In its best form 
it is played by people who have taken the trouble to go to a psychiatrist to examine their motives, 
and to learn what errors to avoid before setting themselves up in this role. 

5 THEY'LL BE GLAD THEY KNEW ME  
Thesis. This is a more worthy variant of ""I'll Show Them."" There are two forms of ""I'll Show 
Them."" In the destructive form White ""shows them"" by inflicting damage on them. Thui he may 
maneuver himself into a superior position, not for the prestige or the material rewards hut because 
it gives him power to exercise his spite. In the constructive form White works hard and exerts every 
effort to gain prestige, not for the sake of craftsmanship or legitimate accomplishment (although 
those may play a secondary role), nor to inflict direct damage on his enemies, but so that they will 
be eaten with envy and with regret for not having treated him better. 
In ""They'll Be Glad They Knew Me,"" White is working not against but for the interests of his 
former associates. He wants to show them that they were justified in treating him with friendliness 
and respect and to demonstrate to them, for their own gratification, that their judgment was sound. 
In order for him to have a secure win in this game, his means as well as his ends must be honorable, 
and that is its superiority over ""I'll Show Them."" Both ""I'll Show Them"" and ""They'll Be Glad"" can 
be merely secondary advantages of success, rather than games. They become games when White is 
more interested in the effects on his enemies or friends than he is in the success itself.

PART III Beyond Games 

CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
The Significance of Games 
1. GAMES are passed on from generation to generation. The favored game of any individual can be 
traced back to his parents and grandparents, and forward to his children; they in turn, unless there is 
a successful intervention, will teach them to his grandchildren. Thus game analysis takes place in a 
grand historical matrix, demonstrably extending back as far as one hundred years and reliably 
projected into the future for at least fifty years. Breaking this chain which involves five or more 
generations may have geometrically progressive effects. There are many living individuals who 
have more than 200 descendants. Games may be diluted or altered from one generation to another, 
hut there seems to be a strong tendency to inbreed with people who play a game of the same family, 
if not of the same genus. That is the historical significance of games. 
2. ""Raising"" children is primarily a matter of teaching them what games to play. Different cultures 
and different social classes favor different types of games, and various tribes and families favor 
different variations of these. That is the cultural significance of games. 
3. Games are sandwiched, as it were, between pastimes and intimacy. Pastimes grow boring with 
repetition, as do promotional cocktail parties. Intimacy requires stringent circumspection, and is 
discriminated against by Parent, Adult and Child. Society frowns upon candidness, except in 
privacy; good sense knows that it can always be abused; and the Child fears it because of the 
unmasking which it involves. Hence in order to get away from the ennui of pastimes without 
exposing themselves to the dangers of intimacy, most people compromise for games when they are 
available, and these fill the major part of the more interesting hours of social intercourse. That is 
the social significance of games. 
4. People pick as friends, associates and intimates other people who play the same games. Hence 
""everybody who is anybody"" in a given social circle (aristocracy, juvenile gang, social club, college 
campus, etc.) behaves in a way which n:ay seem quite foreign to members of a different social 
circle. Conversely, any member of a social circle who changes his games will tend to be extruded, 
but he will find himself welcome at some other social circle. That is the personal significance of 
games. 

NOTE 
The reader should now be in a position to appreciate the basic difference between mathematical and 
transactional game analysis. Mathematical game analysis postulates players who are completely 
rational. Transactional game analysis deals with games which are un-rational, or even irrational, 
and hence more real. 

CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
The Players 
MANY games are played most intensely by disturbed people; generally speaking, the more 
disturbed they are, the harder they play- Curiously enough, however, some schizophrenics seem to 
refuse to play games, and demand candid-ness from the beginning. In everyday life games are 
played with the greatest conviction by two classes of individuals: the Sulks and the Jerks or Squares. 
The Sulk is a man who is angry at his mother. On investigation it emerges that he has been angry at 
her since early childhood. He often has good ""Child"" reasons for his anger: she may have 
""deserted"" him during a critical period in his boyhood by getting sick and going to the hospital, or 
she may have given birth to too many siblings. Sometimes the desertion is more deliberate; she 
may have farmed him out in order to remarry. In any case, he has been sulking ever since. He does 
not like women, although he may be a Don Juan. Since sulking is deliberate at' its inception, the 

76

 
 
 
decision to sulk can be reversed at any period of life, just as it can be during childhood when it 
comes time for dinner. The requirements for reversing the decision are the same for the grown-up 
Sulk as for the little boy. He must be able to save face, and he must be offered something 
worthwhile in exchange for the privilege of sulking. Sometimes a game of ""Psychiatry"" which 
might otherwise last several years can be aborted by reversing a decision to sulk. This requires 
careful preparation of the patient and proper timing and approach. Clumsiness or bullying on the 
part of the therapist will have no better result than it does with a sulky little boy; in the long run, the 
patient will pay the therapist back for his mishandling, just as the little boy will eventually repay 
clumsy parents. 
With female Sulks the situation is the same, mutatis mutandis, if they are angry at father. Their 
""Wooden Leg"" (""What do you expect of a woman who had a Father like that/') must be handled 
with even more diplomacy by a male therapist. Otherwise he risks being thrown into the 
wastebasket of ""men who are like father."" 
There is a bit of Jerk in everyone, but the object of game analysis is to keep it at a minimum. A Jerk 
is someone who is overly sensitive to Parental influences. Hence his Adult data processing and his 
Child's spontaneity are likely to be interfered with at critical moments, resulting in inappropriate or 
clumsy behavior. In extreme cases the Jerk merges with the Toady, the Show-off, and the Cling. 
The Jerk is not to be confused with the bewildered schizophrenic, who has no functioning Parent 
and very little functioning Adult, so that he has to cope with the world in the ego state of a 
confused Child. It is interesting that in common usage ""jerk"" is an epithet applied to men only, or in 
rare cases to masculine women. A Prig is even more of a Square than a Jerk; Prig is a word usually 
reserved for women, but occasionally it is said of men of somewhat feminine tendencies. 

CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
A Paradigm 
CONSIDER the following exchange between a patient (P) and a therapist (T): 
P. ""I have a new project—being on time."" 
T. ""I'll try to cooperate."" 
P. ""I don't care about you. I'm doing it for myself. . , . Guess what grade I got on my history test!"" 
T. ""B+."" 
P. ""How did you know?"" 
T. ""Because you're afraid to get an A."" 
P. ""Yes, I had an A, and I went over my paper and crossed out three correct answers and put in 
three wrong ones."" 
T. ""I like this conversation. It's Jerk-free."" 
P. ""You know, last night I was thinking how much progress I've made. I figured I was only 17% 
Jerk now."" 
T. ""Well, so far this morning, it's zero, so you're entitled to 34% discount on the next round."" 
P. ""It all began six months ago, that time I was looking at my coffeepot, and for the first time I 
really saw it. And you know how it is now, how I hear the birds sing, and I look at people and 
they're really there as people, and best of all, I'm really there. And I'm not only there, but right now 
I'm here. The other day I was standing in the art gallery looking at a picture, and a man came up 
and said, 'Gauguin is very nice, isn't he?' So I said: ‘I like you too’. So we went out and had a drink 
and he's a very nice guy."" 
This is presented as a Jerk-free, game-free conversation between two autonomous Adults, with die 
following annotations. 
""I have a new project—being on time."" This announcement was made after the fact. The patient 
was nearly always late. This time she wasn't. If punctuality had been a resolution, an act of ""will 
power,"" an imposition of the Parent on the Child, made only to be broken, it would have been 
announced before the fact: ""This is the last time I'll be late."" That would have been an attempt to set 

77

 
 
up a game. Her announcement was not. It was an Adult decision, a project, not a resolution. The 
patient continued to be punctual. 
""I'll try to cooperate."" This was not a ""supportive"" statement, nor the first move in a new game of 
""I'm Only Trying to Help You."" The patient's hour came after the therapist's coffee break. Since she 
was habitually late, he had fallen into the habit of taking his time and getting back late himself. 
When she made her declaration, he knew she meant it, and made his. The transaction was an Adult 
contract which both of them kept, and not a Child teasing a Parental figure who because of his 
position felt forced to be a ""good daddy"" and say he would cooperate. 
""I don't care about you."" This emphasizes that her punctuality is a decision, and not a resolution to 
be exploited as part of a pseudo-compliant game. 
""Guess what grade I got."" This is a pastime which both were aware of and felt free to indulge in. 
There was no need for him to demonstrate how alert he was by telling her it was a pastime, 
something she already knew, and there was no need for her to refrain from playing it just because it 
was called a pastime. 
""B+."" The therapist reckoned that in her case this was the only possible grade, and there was no 
reason not to say so. False modesty or a fear of being wrong might have led him to pretend that he 
did not know. 
""How did you know?"" This was an Adult question, not a game of ""Gee You're Wonderful,"" and it 
deserved a pertinent answer. 
""Yes, I had an A."" This was the real test. The patient did not sulk with rationalizations or pleas, but 
faced her Child squarely. 
""I like this conversation."" This and the following semi-facetious remarks were expressions of 
mutual Adult respect, with perhaps a little Parent-Child pastime, which again was optional with 
both of them, and of which they were both aware. 
""For the first time I really saw it."" She is now entitled to her own kind of awareness and is no 
longer obliged to see coffeepots and people the way her parents told her to. ""Right now I'm here."" 
She no longer lives in the future or the past, but can discuss them briefly if it serves a useful 
purpose. 
""I said: 'I like you too.'"" She is not obliged-to waste time playing ""Art Gallery"" with the newcomer, 
although she could if she chose to. 
The therapist, on his part, does not feel obliged to play ""Psychiatry."" There were several 
opportunities to bring up questions of defense, transference and symbolic interpretation, but he was 
able to let these go by without feeling any anxiety. It did seem worthwhile, however, to ascertain 
for future reference which answers she crossed out on her examination. During the rest of the hour, 
unfortunately, the 17% of Jerk left in the patient and the 18% left in the therapist showed from time 
to time. In summary, the proceedings given constitute an activity enlightened with some pastime. 

CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
Autonomy 
THE attainment of autonomy is manifested by the release or recovery of three capacities: 
awareness, spontaneity and 
intimacy. 
Awareness. Awareness means the capacity to see a coffeepot and hear the birds sing in one's own 
way, and not the way one was taught. It may be assumed on good grounds that seeing and hearing 
have a different quality for infants than for grownups,1 and that they are more esthetic and less 
intellectual in the first' years of life. A little boy sees and hears birds with delight. Then the ""good 
father"" comes along and feels he should ""share"" the experience and help his son ""develop."" He says: 
""That's a jay, and this is a sparrow."" The moment the little boy is concerned with which is a jay and 
which is a sparrow, he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing. He has to see and hear them 
the way his father wants him to. Father has good reasons on his side, since few people can afford to 
go through life listening to the birds sing, and the sooner the little boy starts his ""education"" the 

78

 
 
better. Maybe he will be an ornithologist when he grows up. A few people, however, can still see 
and hear in the old way. But most of the members of the human race have lost the capacity to be 
painters, poets or musicians, and are not left the option of seeing and hearing directly even if they 
can afford to; they must get it secondhand. The recovery of this ability is called here ""awareness."" 
Physiologically awareness is eidetic perception, allied to eidetic imagery.2 Perhaps there is also 
eidetic perception, at least in certain individuals, in the spheres of taste, smell and kinesthesia, 
giving us the artists in those fields: chefs, perfumers and dancers, whose eternal problem is to find 
audiences capable of appreciating their products. 
Awareness requires living in the here and now, and not in the elsewhere, the past or the future. A 
good illustration of possibilities, in American life, is driving to work in the morning in a hurry. The 
decisive question is: ""Where is the mind when the body is here?"" and there are three common cases. 
1. The man whose chief preoccupation is being on time is die one who is furthest out. With his 
body at the wheel of his car, his mind is at the door of his office, and he is oblivious to his 
immediate surroundings except insofar as they are obstacles to the moment when his soma will 
catch up with his psyche. This is the Jerk, whose chief concern is how it will look to the boss. If he 
is late, he will take pains to arrive out of breath. The compliant Child is in command, and his game 
is ""Look How Hard I've Tried."" While he is driving, he is almost completely lacking in autonomy, 
and as a human being he is in essence more dead than alive. It is quite possible that this is the most 
favorable condition for the development of hypertension or coronary disease. 
2. The Sulk, on the other hand, is not so much concerned with arriving on time as in collecting 
excuses for being late. Mishaps, badly timed lights and poor driving or stupidity on the part of 
others fit well into his scheme and are secretly welcomed as contributions to his rebellious Child or 
righteous Parent game of ""Look What They Made Me Do."" He, too, is oblivious to his surroundings 
except as they subscribe to his game, so that he is only half alive. His body is in his car, but his 
mind is out searching for blemishes and injustices. 
3. Less common is the ""natural driver,"" the man to whom driving a car is a congenial science and 
art. As he makes his way swiftly and skillfully through the traffic, he is at one with his vehicle. He, 
too, is oblivious of his surroundings except as they offer scope for the craftsmanship which is its 
own reward, but he is very much aware of himself and the machine which he controls so well, and 
to that extent he is alive. Such driving is formally an Adult pastime from which his Child and 
Parent may also derive satisfaction. 
4. The Fourth case is the person who is aware, and who will not hurry because he is living in the 
present moment with the environment which is here: the sky and the trees as well as the feeling of 
motion. To hurry is to neglect that environment and to be conscious only of something that is still 
out of sight down the road, or of mere obstacles, or solely of oneself. A Chinese man started to get 
into a local subway train, when his Caucasian companion pointed out that they could save twenty 
minutes by taking an express, which they did. When they got off at Central Park, the Chinese man 
sat down on a bench, much to his friend's surprise. ""Well,"" explained the former, ""since we saved 
twenty minutes, we can afford to sit here that long and enjoy our surroundings."" 
The aware person is alive because he knows how he feels, where he is and when it is. He knows 
that after he dies the trees will still be there, but he will not be there to look at them again, so he 
wants to see them now with as much poignancy as possible. 
Spontaneity. Spontaneity means option, the freedom to choose and express one's feelings from the 
assortment available (Parent feelings, Adult Feelings and Child feelings). It means liberation, 
liberation from the compulsion to play games and have only the feelings one was taught to have. 
Intimacy. Intimacy means the spontaneous, game-free candidness of an aware person, the liberation 
of the eidetically perceptive, uncorrupted Child in all its naivete"" living in the here and now. It can 
be shown experimentally3 that eidetic perception evokes affection, and that candidness mobilizes 
positive feelings, so that there is even such a thing as ""one-sided intimacy"" - a phenomenon well 
known, although not by that name, to professional seducers, who are able to capture their partners 
without becoming involved themselves. This they do by encouraging the other person to look at 

79

 
them directly and to talk Freely, while the male or Female seducer makes only a well-guarded 
pretense of reciprocating. 
Because intimacy is essentially a function of the natural Child (although expressed in a matrix of 
psychological and social complications), it tends to turn out well if not disturbed by the intervention 
of games. Usually the adaptation to Parental influences is what spoils it, and most unfortunately 
this is almost a universal occurrence. But before, unless and until they are corrupted, most infants 
seem to be loving,4 and that is the essential nature of intimacy, as shown experimentally,

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
The Attainment of Autonomy 
PARENTS, deliberately or unaware, teach their children from birth how to behave, drink, feel and 
perceive. Liberation from these influences is no easy matter, since they are deeply ingrained and 
are necessary during the first two or three decades of life for biological and social survival. Indeed, 
such liberation is only possible at all because the individual starts off in an autonomous state, that is, 
capable of awareness, spontaneity and intimacy, and he has some discretion as to which parts of his 
parents' teachings he will accept. At certain specific moments early in life he decides how he is 
going to adapt to diem. It is because his adaptation is in the nature of a series of decisions that it can 
be undone, since decisions are reversible under favorable circumstances. 
The attainment of autonomy, then, consists of the overthrow of all those irrelevancies discussed in 
Chapters 13, 14 and 15. And such overthrow is never final: there is a continual battle against 
sinking back into the old ways. 
First, as discussed in Chapter 13, the weight of a whole tribal or family historical tradition has to be 
lifted, as in the case of Margaret Mead's villagers in New Guinea1; then the influence of the 
individual parental, social and cultural background has to be thrown off. The same must be done 
with the demands of contemporary society at large, and finally die advantages derived from one's 
immediate social circle have to be partly or wholly sacrificed. Then all the easy indulgences and 
rewards of being a Sulk or a Jerk, as described in Chapter 14, have to be given up. Following this, 
the individual must attain personal and social control, so that all the classes of behavior described 
in the Appendix, except perhaps dreams, become free choices subject only to his will. He is then 
ready for game-free relationships such as that illustrated in the paradigm in Chapter 15, At this 
point he may be able to develop his capacities for autonomy. In essence, diis whole preparation 
consists of obtaining a friendly divorce from one's parents (and from other Parental influences) so 
that they may be agreeably visited on occasion, but are no longer dominant.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
After Games, What? 
THE somber picture presented in Parts I and II of this book, in which human life is mainly a 
process of filling in time until the arrival of death, or Santa Claus, with very little choice, if any, of 
what kind of business one is going to transact during the long wait, is a commonplace but not the 
final answer. For certain fortunate people there is something which transcends all classifications of 
behavior, and that is awareness; something which rises above the programming of the past, and that 
is spontaneity; and something that is more rewarding than games, and that is intimacy. But all three 
of these may be frightening and even perilous to the unprepared. Perhaps they are better off as they 
are, seeking their solutions in popular techniques of social action, such as ""togetherness."" This may 
mean that there is no hope for the human race, but there is hope for individual members of it. 

APPENDIX 

The Classification of Behavior 
AT ANY given moment a human being is engaged in one or more of the following classes of 
behavior: 
CLASS i. Internally programed (archaeopsychic). Autistic behavior. 
Orders: (a) Dreams. 
(b) Fantasies. 
Families: i. Extraneous fantasies (wish fulfillment). ii. Autistic transactions, Un- 
adapted. 
iii. Autistic transactions, Adapted (with neopsychic programing). 
(c) Fugues. 
(d) Delusional behavior. 
(e) Involuntary actions. Families: i. Tics. 
ii. Mannerisms, iii. Parapraxes. 
(f) Others. 
CLASS ii. Probability programed (neopsycKic). Reality-tested behavior. 
Orders: (a) Activities. 
Families: i. Professions, trades, etc. ii. Sports, hobbies, etc, 
(b) Procedures. 
Families: i. Data processing, ii. Techniques. 
(c) Others. 
CLASS in. Socially programed (partly exteropsychic). Social behavior. 
IBS 
Orders: (a) Rituals and ceremonies. 
(b) Pastimes. 
(c) Operations and maneuvers. 
(d) Games. 
Suborders: A. Professional games (angular transactions). B. Social games (duplex transactions). 
(e) Intimacy. 
In this scheme the social games previously discussed would be classified as follows: Class III, 
Socially programed; Order (d), Games; Suborder B, Social Games. 
Intimacy, ""the end of the line,"" is the final classification, and is part of game-free living. 
The reader should feel free to carp (but not to gleek or fleer) at the above classification. It is 
included not because the writer is in love with it, but because it is more functional, real and 
practical than other systems now in use and can be helpful to those who like or need taxonomy.

Preface to the Fourth Edition, 

by Warren E. Buffett

I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine-
teen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing
ever written. I still think it is.

To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-
spheric  IQ,  unusual  business  insights,  or  inside  information.
What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-
sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-
work.  This  book  precisely  and  clearly  prescribes  the  proper
framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.

If  you  follow  the  behavioral  and  business  principles  that  Gra-
ham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable
advice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from
your  investments.  (That  represents  more  of  an  accomplishment
than  you  might  think.)  Whether  you  achieve  outstanding  results
will  depend  on  the  effort  and  intellect  you  apply  to  your  invest-
ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-
vail during your investing career. The sillier the market’s behavior,
the  greater  the  opportunity  for  the  business-like  investor.  Follow
Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.
To me,  Ben  Graham  was  far  more  than  an  author  or  a  teacher.
More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.
Shortly  after  Ben’s  death  in  1976,  I  wrote  the  following  short
remembrance  about  him  in  the  Financial  Analysts  Journal. As  you
read the book, I believe you’ll perceive some of the qualities I men-
tioned in this tribute.

Preface to the Fourth Edition

BENJAMIN GRAHAM

1894–1976

Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend
the thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish, something
creative and something generous.”

The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-
aging  ideas  in  a  form  that  avoided  any  overtones  of  sermonizing  or 
self-importance.  Although  his  ideas  were  powerful,  their  delivery  was
unfailingly gentle.

Readers  of  this  magazine  need  no  elaboration  of  his  achievements  as
measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-
pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.
But  over  forty  years  after  publication  of  the  book  that  brought  structure
and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-
sible  candidates  for  even  the  runner-up  position  in  the  field  of  security
analysis.  In  an  area  where  much  looks  foolish  within  weeks  or  months
after publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often
enhanced  and  better  understood  in  the  wake  of  financial  storms  that
demolished  flimsier  intellectual  structures.  His  counsel  of  soundness
brought  unfailing  rewards  to  his  followers—even  to  those  with  natural
abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-
ing counsels of brilliance or fashion.

A remarkable  aspect  of  Ben’s  dominance  of  his  professional  field  was
that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-
trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of
an  intellect  whose  breadth  almost  exceeded  definition.  Certainly  I  have
never  met  anyone  with  a  mind  of  similar  scope.  Virtually  total  recall,
unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a
form  applicable  to  seemingly  unrelated  problems  made  exposure  to  his
thinking in any field a delight.

But his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond
all others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each
relationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there
was  an  absolutely  open-ended,  no-scores-kept  generosity  of  ideas,  time,
and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to
go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.

Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit

under. Ben Graham was such a man.

A Note About Benjamin Graham

by Jason Zweig

Who was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?

Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was
also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,
money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by
superstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis
was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-
fession.1

And The  Intelligent  Investor is the first book ever to describe, for
individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that
are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on
investing  ever  written  for  the  general  public.  The  Intelligent  Investor
was  the  first  book  I  read  when  I  joined  Forbes Magazine  as  a  cub
reporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner
or later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-
fered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,
after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market
that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more prophet-
ically than ever.)

Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the
anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and
psychology  of  the  markets.  He  was  born  Benjamin  Grossbaum  on
May 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and
figurines.2 The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At
first they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-

1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.
2 The  Grossbaums  changed  their  name  to  Graham  during  World  War  I,
when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.

erness—on  upper  Fifth  Avenue.  But  Ben’s  father  died  in  1903,  the
porcelain  business  faltered,  and  the  family  slid  haltingly  into  poverty.
Ben’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-
ing money to trade stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash
of  1907.  For  the  rest  of  his  life,  Ben  would  recall  the  humiliation  of
cashing  a  check  for  his  mother  and  hearing  the  bank  teller  ask,  “Is
Dorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”

Fortunately,  Graham  won  a  scholarship  at  Columbia,  where  his 
brilliance  burst  into  full  flower.  He  graduated  in  1914,  second  in  his
class. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—
English,  philosophy,  and  mathematics—asked  him  to  join  the  faculty.
He was all of 20 years old.

Instead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.
He started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,
then a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-
nership.

The Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In
April  1919,  he  earned  a  250%  return  on  the  first  day  of  trading  for
Savold  Tire,  a  new  offering  in  the  booming  automotive  business;  by
October,  the  company  had  been  exposed  as  a  fraud  and  the  stock
was worthless.

Graham  became  a  master  at  researching  stocks  in  microscopic,
almost  molecular,  detail.  In  1925,  plowing  through  the  obscure
reports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-
mission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $65
per  share—held  at  least  $80  per  share  in  high-quality  bonds.  (He
bought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and
came away with $110 per share three years later.)

Despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of
1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting
bargains  from  the  wreckage  of  the  bull  market.  There  is  no  exact
record of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in
1956,  his  Graham-Newman  Corp.  gained  at  least  14.7%  annually,
versus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-
term track records on Wall Street history.3

3 Graham-Newman  Corp.  was  an  open-end  mutual  fund  (see  Chapter  9)
that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his
own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new investors. I am

How  did  Graham  do  it?  Combining  his  extraordinary  intellectual
powers  with  profound  common  sense  and  vast  experience,  Graham
developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they
were during his lifetime:

•

•

•

•

•

A stock  is  not  just  a  ticker  symbol  or  an  electronic  blip;  it  is  an
ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value
that does not depend on its share price.
The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-
able optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified
pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor
is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
The  future  value  of  every  investment  is  a  function  of  its  present
price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever
eliminate  is  the  risk  of  being  wrong.  Only  by  insisting  on  what
Graham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-
ter  how  exciting  an  investment  seems  to  be—can  you  minimize
your odds of error.
The  secret  to  your  financial  success  is  inside  yourself.  If  you
become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,
and  you  invest  with  patient  confidence,  you  can  take  steady
advantage  of  even  the  worst  bear  markets.  By  developing  your
discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood
swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-
ments behave is much less important than how you behave.

The goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investor is to apply
Graham’s  ideas  to  today’s  financial  markets  while  leaving  his  text
entirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4 After
each  of  Graham’s  chapters  you’ll  find  a  new  commentary.  In  these
reader’s guides, I’ve added recent examples that should show you just
how relevant—and how liberating—Graham’s principles remain today.

grateful  to  Walter  Schloss  for  providing  data  essential  to  estimating 
Graham-Newman’s  returns.  The  20%  annual  average  return  that  Graham
cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take management fees into
account.

A Note About Benjamin Graham

I envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading Graham’s
masterpiece for the first time—or even the third or fourth time. Like all
classics, it alters how we view the world and renews itself by educat-
ing us. And the more you read it, the better it gets. With Graham as
your  guide,  you  are  guaranteed  to  become  a  vastly  more  intelligent
investor.

What This Book Expects to Accomplish

The purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for lay-
men, guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment pol-
icy.  Comparatively  little  will  be  said  here  about  the  technique  of
analyzing  securities;  attention  will  be  paid  chiefly  to  investment
principles  and  investors’  attitudes.  We  shall,  however,  provide  a
number of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in
pairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—
in order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements
involved in specific choices of common stocks.

But much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns
of  financial  markets,  in  some  cases  running  back  over  many
decades.  To  invest  intelligently  in  securities  one  should  be  fore-
armed  with  an  adequate  knowledge  of  how  the  various  types  of
bonds  and  stocks  have  actually  behaved  under  varying  condi-
tions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s
own experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to
Wall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do
not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

Our text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-
tors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all
but forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a
“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to
riches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up
what  we  have  just  said  by  a  bit  of  financial  history—especially
since there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-
mactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally
as well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an
article in the Ladies’ Home Journal, entitled “Everybody Ought to Be

1

Introduction

Rich.” * His thesis was that savings of only $15 per month invested
in good common stocks—with dividends reinvested—would pro-
duce an estate of $80,000 in twenty years against total contributions
of  only  $3,600.  If  the  General  Motors  tycoon  was  right,  this  was
indeed  a  simple  road  to  riches.  How  nearly  right  was  he?  Our
rough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks
making  up  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  (DJIA)—indicates
that if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,
the investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been
worth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise
of $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such
optimistic  forecasts  and  assurances.  But,  as  an  aside,  we  should
remark  that  the  return  actually  realized  by  the  20-year  operation
would have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this
despite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases
with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948
closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive
argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong
common  stocks  through  thick  and  thin—a  program  known  as 
“dollar-cost averaging.”

Since  our  book  is  not  addressed  to  speculators,  it  is  not  meant
for those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided
by  charts  or  other  largely  mechanical  means  of  determining  the
right  moments  to  buy  and  sell.  The  one  principle  that  applies  to
nearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should
buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell
because it has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business
sense  everywhere  else,  and  it  is  most  unlikely  that  it  can  lead  to

* Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-
pany,  and  chairman  of  the  finance  committee  at  General  Motors.  He  also
served  as  national  chairman  of  the  Democratic  Party  and  was  the  driving
force behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by
finance  professor  Jeremy  Siegel  confirm  that  Raskob’s  plan  would  have
grown  to  just  under  $9,000  after  20  years,  although  inflation  would  have
eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent look at Raskob’s views on
long-term stock investing, see the essay by financial adviser William Bern-
stein at www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.

lasting success on Wall Street. In our own stock-market experience
and  observation,  extending  over  50  years,  we  have  not  known  a
single  person  who  has  consistently  or  lastingly  made  money  by
thus “following the market.” We do not hesitate to declare that this
approach  is  as  fallacious  as  it  is  popular.  We  shall  illustrate  what
we  have  just  said—though,  of  course  this  should  not  be  taken  as
proof—by  a  later  brief  discussion  of  the  famous  Dow  theory  for
trading in the stock market.*

Since  its  first  publication  in  1949,  revisions  of  The  Intelligent
Investor have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In
updating  the  current  version  we  shall  have  to  deal  with  quite  a
number of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.
These include:

1. An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade

bonds.

2. A fall  of  about  35%  in  the  price  level  of  leading  common
stocks,  ending  in  May  1970.  This  was  the  highest  percentage
decline  in  some  30  years.  (Countless  issues  of  lower  quality
had a much larger shrinkage.)

3. A persistent  inflation  of  wholesale  and  consumer’s  prices,
which gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-
eral business in 1970.

4. The  rapid  development  of  “conglomerate”  companies,  fran-
chise  operations,  and  other  relative  novelties  in  business  and
finance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as “let-
ter stock,” 1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading

† Mutual  funds  bought  “letter  stock”  in  private  transactions,  then  immedi-
ately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s definition

returns  in  the  mid-1960s.  The  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission
cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund
investors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.

Introduction

5. Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-
term  debt  of  many  formerly  strongly  entrenched  companies,
and even a disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street
houses.*

6. The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of
investment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,
with disquieting results.

These phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some
will require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-
ous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should
not alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-
ples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-
nisms and climate.

The last statement was put to the test during the writing of the
present  edition,  the  first  draft  of  which  was  finished  in  January
1971. At that time the DJIA was in a strong recovery from its 1970
low  of  632  and  was  advancing  toward  a  1971  high  of  951,  with
attendant  general  optimism.  As  the  last  draft  was  finished,  in
November 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-
rying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its
future. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general
attitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-
tially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.

The  extent  of  the  market’s  shrinkage  in  1969–70  should  have
served  to  dispel  an  illusion  that  had  been  gaining  ground  dur-
ing  the  past  two  decades.  This  was  that  leading  common  stocks
could be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not
only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon
be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-

* The  Penn  Central  Transportation  Co.,  then  the  biggest  railroad  in  the
United  States,  sought  bankruptcy  protection  on  June  21,  1970—shocking
investors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see
p. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham had in mind
were  Ling-Temco-Vought  and  National  General  Corp.  (see  pp.  425  and
463).  The  “problem  of  solvency”  on  Wall  Street  emerged  between  1968
and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went bust.

els. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has
“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock
investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-
haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.

In  the  area  of  many  secondary  and  third-line  common  stocks,
especially  recently  floated  enterprises,  the  havoc  wrought  by  the
last  market  break  was  catastrophic.  This  was  nothing  new  in
itself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there
was  now  a  novel  element  in  the  fact  that  some  of  the  investment
funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously
overvalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who
needs  to  be  warned  that  while  enthusiasm  may  be  necessary  for
great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-
ably leads to disaster.

The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the
huge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967
the  investor  has  been  able  to  obtain  more  than  twice  as  much
income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-
tive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%
on  highest-grade  bonds  versus  only  2.76%  on  industrial  stocks.
(This  compares  with  4.40%  and  2.92%  respectively  at  the  end  of
1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949
the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only
2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2 In previous editions we have
consistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s
portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general
a  50–50  division  between  the  two  media.  We  must  now  consider
whether  the  current  great  advantage  of  bond  yields  over  stock
yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-
tionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-
tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision
here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*

* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-
ing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all that
different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generated
by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.

Introduction

In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds
of  investors  to  whom  this  book  was  addressed—the  “defensive”
and  the  “enterprising.”  The  defensive  (or  passive)  investor  will
place  his  chief  emphasis  on  the  avoidance  of  serious  mistakes  or
losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and
the  need  for  making  frequent  decisions.  The  determining  trait  of
the enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness
to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
sound  and  more  attractive  than  the  average.  Over  many  decades
an  enterprising  investor  of  this  sort  could  expect  a  worthwhile
reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average
return  than  that  realized  by  the  passive  investor.  We  have  some
doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to
the active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the
years after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to
devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as
they existed in former periods and may return.

It  has  long  been  the  prevalent  view  that  the  art  of  success-
ful  investment  lies  first  in  the  choice  of  those  industries  that 
are  most  likely  to  grow  in  the  future  and  then  in  identifying  the
most promising companies in these industries. For example, smart
investors—or  their  smart  advisers—would  long  ago  have  recog-
nized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a
whole  and  of  International  Business  Machines  in  particular. And
similarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-
panies.  But  this  is  not  as  easy  as  it  always  looks  in  retrospect.  To
bring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that
we included first in the 1949 edition of this book.

Such  an  investor  may  for  example  be  a  buyer  of  air-transport
stocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than
the trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the
value of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls
lurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive
technique that will help him along his path.*

* “Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement in the late
1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later. Among
the  hottest  mutual  funds  of  that  era  were  Aeronautical  Securities  and  the

What This Book Expects to Accomplish

The pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry
we mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of
air traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this
factor  their  shares  became  a  favorite  choice  of  the  investment
funds.  But  despite  the  expansion  of  revenues—at  a  pace  even
greater  than  in  the  computer  industry—a  combination  of  techno-
logical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-
ing and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a
new  high  in  traffic  figures,  the  airlines  sustained  a  loss  of  some
$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in
1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a
greater decline in 1969–70 than did the general market. The record
shows  that  even  the  highly  paid  full-time  experts  of  the  mutual
funds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of
a major and nonesoteric industry.

On the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial
investments  and  substantial  gains  in  IBM,  the  combination  of  its
apparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about
its rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%
of  their  funds  in  this  wonderful  performer.  Hence  the  effect  of 
this  excellent  choice  on  their  overall  results  was  by  no  means 
decisive. Furthermore, many—if not most—of their investments in
computer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been
unprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals
for our readers:

1. Obvious  prospects  for  physical  growth  in  a  business  do  not

translate into obvious profits for investors.

2. The  experts  do  not  have  dependable  ways  of  selecting  and
concentrating  on  the  most  promising  companies  in  the  most
promising industries.

Missiles-Rockets-Jets & Automation Fund. They, like the stocks they owned,
turned out to be an investing disaster. It is commonly accepted today that
the  cumulative  earnings  of  the  airline  industry  over  its  entire  history  have
been negative. The lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid
buying airline stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty”
that any industry will outperform all others in the future.

Introduction

The author did not follow this approach in his financial career as
fund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much
encouragement to those who may wish to try it.

What  then  will  we  aim  to  accomplish  in  this  book?  Our  main
objective  will  be  to  guide  the  reader  against  the  areas  of  possible
substantial  error  and  to  develop  policies  with  which  he  will  be
comfortable.  We  shall  say  quite  a  bit  about  the  psychology  of
investors. For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his
worst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is
not in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves. . . .”) This
has  proved  the  more  true  over  recent  decades  as  it  has  become
more  necessary  for  conservative  investors  to  acquire  common
stocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement
and the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,
and exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper
mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.
We have seen much more money made and kept by “ordinary peo-
ple”  who  were  temperamentally  well  suited  for  the  investment
process  than  by  those  who  lacked  this  quality,  even  though  they
had  an  extensive  knowledge  of  finance,  accounting,  and  stock-
market lore.

Additionally,  we  hope  to  implant  in  the  reader  a  tendency  to
measure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at
some price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price
they would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-
ing  what  is  paid  to  what  is  being  offered  is  an  invaluable  trait  in
investment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago
we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-
ceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses
of the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were
realized  in  those  common-stock  issues  where  the  buyer  forgot  to
ask “How much?”

In June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by
the  magic  figure  9.40%—the  yield  obtainable  on  new  offerings  of
high-grade  public-utility  bonds.  This  has  now  dropped  to  about
7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other
answer?” But there are other possible answers, and these must be
carefully  considered.  Besides  which,  we  repeat  that  both  we  and
our readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif-
ferent conditions of, say, 1973–1977.

We shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for
common-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of
both classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter-
prising  group.  Strangely  enough,  we  shall  suggest  as  one  of  our
chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues
selling  not  far  above  their  tangible-asset  value.*  The  reason  for 
this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-
cal.  Experience  has  taught  us  that,  while  there  are  many  good
growth  companies  worth  several  times  net  assets,  the  buyer  of
such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations
of  the  stock  market.  By  contrast,  the  investor  in  shares,  say,  of 
public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always
consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding
businesses,  acquired  at  a  rational  price—regardless  of  what  the
stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such
a  conservative  policy  is  likely  to  work  out  better  than  exciting
adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated
growth.

The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally
appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved
by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to
improve this easily attainable standard requires much application
and more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a
little extra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment
program, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you
may well find that you have done worse.

Since  anyone—by  just  buying  and  holding  a  representative
list—can  equal  the  performance  of  the  market  averages,  it  would
seem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as
a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail
is  surprisingly  large.  Even  the  majority  of  the  investment  funds,
with  all  their  experienced  personnel,  have  not  performed  so  well

* Tangible  assets  include  a  company’s  physical  property  (like  real  estate,
factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (such
as cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable). Among the ele-
ments not included in tangible assets are brands, copyrights, patents, fran-
chises,  goodwill,  and  trademarks.  To  see  how  to  calculate  tangible-asset
value, see footnote † on p. 198.

Introduction

over  the  years  as  has  the  general  market. Allied  to  the  foregoing 
is  the  record  of  the  published  stock-market  predictions  of  the 
brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated
forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing
of a coin.

In  writing  this  book  we  have  tried  to  keep  this  basic  pitfall  of
investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have
been emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-
sified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carry
out with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe
and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-
ing  difficulties,  especially  in  the  area  of  temperament.  Before
attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself
and  of  his  advisers—particularly  as  to  whether  they  have  a  clear
concept of the differences between investment and speculation and
between market price and underlying value.

A strong-minded  approach  to  investment,  firmly  based  on  the
margin-of-safety  principle,  can  yield  handsome  rewards.  But  a
decision  to  try  for  these  emoluments  rather  than  for  the  assured
fruits of defensive investment should not be made without much
self-examination.

A final  retrospective  thought.  When  the  young  author  entered
Wall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next
half-century had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect
that a World War was to break out in two months, and close down
the New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the
richest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sorts
of  major  problems  and  more  apprehensive  than  confident  of  the
future.  Yet  if  we  confine  our  attention  to  American  investment
experience,  there  is  some  comfort  to  be  gleaned  from  the  last  57
years.  Through  all  their  vicissitudes  and  casualties,  as  earth-
shaking  as  they  were  unforeseen,  it  remained  true  that  sound
investment principles produced generally sound results. We must
act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.

Note to the Reader: This book does not address itself to the overall
financial  policy  of  savers  and  investors;  it  deals  only  with  that 
portion  of  their  funds  which  they  are  prepared  to  place  in  mar-
ketable  (or  redeemable)  securities,  that  is,  in  bonds  and  stocks.

Consequently we do not discuss such important media as savings
and  time  desposits,  savings-and-loan-association  accounts,  life
insurance,  annuities,  and  real-estate  mortgages  or  equity  owner-
ship. The reader should bear in mind that when he finds the word
“now,”  or  the  equivalent,  in  the  text,  it  refers  to  late  1971  or 
early 1972.

COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION

If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;
that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under
them.

—Henry David Thoreau, Walden

Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not

tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.

Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:

•
•
•

how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;
how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;
how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most
investors from reaching their full potential.

Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks
seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could
lose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,
many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value
or more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%
just  to  get  back  to  where  you  started.1 Taking  a  foolish  risk  can  put
you so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’s
why  Graham  constantly  emphasizes  the  importance  of  avoiding
losses—not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-
ing that he has woven throughout his entire text.

But  no  matter  how  careful  you  are,  the  price  of  your  investments
will go down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,

1 To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are likely to
buy a stock at $30 and be able to sell it at $600.

Graham will show you how to manage it—and how to get your fears
under control.

A R E   Y O U   A N   I N T E L L I G E N T   I N V E S T O R ?

Now let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-
ham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this
book, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of
intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means
being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to
harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,
explains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.” 2

There’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to
make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management
L.P.,  a  hedge  fund  run  by  a  battalion  of  mathematicians,  computer 
scientists,  and  two  Nobel  Prize–winning  economists,  lost  more  than 
$2  billion  in  a  matter  of  weeks  on  a  huge  bet  that  the  bond  market
would return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming
more and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money
that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3

And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in
the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that
the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that
he  “could  calculate  the  motions  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  but  not  the
madness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-
eting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in
the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much
higher  price—and  lost  £20,000  (or  more  than  $3  million  in  today’s
money). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words
“South Sea” in his presence.4

Commentary on the Introduction

Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever
lived, as most of us would define intelligence. But, in Graham’s terms,
Newton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the
crowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted
like a fool.

In short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’re
stupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed the
emotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,
Graham  describes  how  to  enhance  your  intelligence  by  harnessing
your emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-
ity. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is
more a matter of “character” than “brain.”

Now let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-
opments of the past few years:

1. The  worst  market  crash  since  the  Great  Depression,  with  U.S.
stocks  losing  50.2%  of  their  value—or  $7.4  trillion—between
March 2000 and October 2002.

2. Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of
the  1990s,  including  AOL,  Cisco,  JDS  Uniphase,  Lucent,  and
Qualcomm—plus  the  utter  destruction  of  hundreds  of  Internet
stocks.

3. Accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest and
most  respected  corporations  in  America,  including  Enron,  Tyco,
and Xerox.

4. The  bankruptcies  of  such  once-glistening  companies  as  Con-

seco, Global Crossing, and WorldCom.

5. Allegations  that  accounting  firms  cooked  the  books,  and  even
destroyed records, to help their clients mislead the investing public.
6. Charges  that  top  executives  at  leading  companies  siphoned  off

hundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain.

7. Proof that security analysts on Wall Street praised stocks publicly

but admitted privately that they were garbage.

8. A stock market that, even after its bloodcurdling decline, seems
overvalued  by  historical  measures,  suggesting  to  many  experts
that stocks have further yet to fall.

Commentary on the Introduction

15

9. A relentless decline in interest rates that has left investors with no

attractive alternative to stocks.

10. An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace

of global terrorism and war in the Middle East.

Much  of  this  damage  could  have  been  (and  was!)  avoided  by
investors who learned and lived by Graham’s principles. As Graham
puts  it,  “while  enthusiasm  may  be  necessary  for  great  accomplish-
ments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”
By  letting  themselves  get  carried  away—on  Internet  stocks,  on  big
“growth” stocks, on stocks as a whole—many people made the same
stupid  mistakes  as  Sir  Isaac  Newton.  They  let  other  investors’  judg-
ments determine their own. They ignored Graham’s warning that “the
really  dreadful  losses”  always  occur  after  “the  buyer  forgot  to  ask
‘How  much?’ ”  Most  painfully  of  all,  by  losing  their  self-control  just
when they needed it the most, these people proved Graham’s asser-
tion that “the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is
likely to be himself.”

Many of those people got especially carried away on technology and
Internet stocks, believing the high-tech hype that this industry would
keep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:

•

In  mid-1999,  after  earning  a  117.3%  return  in  just  the  first  five
months  of  the  year,  Monument  Internet  Fund  portfolio  manager
Alexander Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year
over  the  next  three  to  five  years  and  an  annual  average  of  35%
“over the next 20 years.” 5

5 Constance Loizos, “Q&A: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews, May 17, 1999,
p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history was 25.8% per year,
achieved  by  the  legendary  Peter  Lynch  of  Fidelity  Magellan  over  the  two
decades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s performance turned $10,000
into more than $982,000 in 20 years. Cheung was predicting that his fund
would turn $10,000 into more than $4 million over the same length of time.
Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously overoptimistic, investors threw

Commentary on the Introduction

After his Amerindo Technology Fund rose an incredible 248.9%
in  1999,  portfolio  manager  Alberto  Vilar  ridiculed  anyone  who
dared  to  doubt  that  the  Internet  was  a  perpetual  moneymaking
machine:  “If  you’re  out  of  this  sector,  you’re  going  to  underper-
form.  You’re  in  a  horse  and  buggy,  and  I’m  in  a  Porsche.  You 
don’t  like  tenfold  growth  opportunities?  Then  go  with  someone
else.” 6
In  February  2000,  hedge-fund  manager  James  J.  Cramer  pro-
claimed that Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth
owning right now.” These “winners of the new world,” as he called
them,  “are  the  only  ones  that  are  going  higher  consistently  in
good days and bad.” Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: “You
have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that
existed before the Web. . . . If we used any of what Graham and
Dodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under management.” 7

All these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warn-
ing:  “Obvious  prospects  for  physical  growth  in  a  business  do  not
translate  into  obvious  profits  for  investors.”  While  it  seems  easy  to
foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real
value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By
the time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best

money  at  him,  flinging  more  than  $100  million  into  his  fund  over  the  next
year.  A  $10,000  investment  in  the  Monument  Internet  Fund  in  May  1999
would  have  shrunk  to  roughly  $2,000  by  year-end  2002.  (The  Monument
fund  no  longer  exists  in  its  original  form  and  is  now  known  as  Orbitex
Emerging Technology Fund.)

If you had invested $10,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999, you would
have finished 2002 with just $1,195 left—one of the worst destructions of

one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that
its future returns have nowhere to go but down.

For now at least, no one has the gall to try claiming that technology
will  still  be  the  world’s  greatest  growth  industry.  But  make  sure  you
remember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing”
will be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely
to be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.

If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve
reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The
pendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational
exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27
billion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-
rities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cut
back on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to
buy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,
therefore,  becoming  expensive—sold  stocks  as  they  went  down  in
price and, by definition, became cheaper.

As Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly back-
wards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,
not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices
fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks
more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash
on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear
market, since it puts stocks back on sale.8

So  take  heart:  The  death  of  the  bull  market  is  not  the  bad  news
everyone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now
is  a  considerably  safer—and  saner—time  to  be  building  wealth.  Read
on, and let Graham show you how.

8 The  only  exception  to  this  rule  is  an  investor  in  the  advanced  stage  of
retirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even an
elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone
down in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones
but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs
for tax purposes.

CHAPTER 1

Investment versus Speculation: Results to

Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor

This  chapter  will  outline  the  viewpoints  that  will  be  set  forth  in
the remainder of the book. In particular we wish to develop at the
outset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ-
ual, nonprofessional investor.

Investment versus Speculation

What  do  we  mean  by  “investor”?  Throughout  this  book  the
term will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far back
as 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1 we attempted a precise
formulation  of  the  difference  between  the  two,  as  follows:  “An
investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-
ises  safety  of  principal  and  an  adequate  return.  Operations  not
meeting these requirements are speculative.”

While  we  have  clung  tenaciously  to  this  definition  over  the
ensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that
have occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.
After  the  great  market  decline  of  1929–1932  all common  stocks
were widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-
ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)
Thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that
it gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.

Now our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our
readers from accepting the common jargon which applies the term
“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market. In our
last edition we cited the following headline of a front-page article
of our leading financial journal in June 1962:

18

Investment versus Speculation

SMALL INVESTORS BEARISH, THEY ARE SELLING ODD-LOTS SHORT

In October 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it
called  “reckless  investors,”  who  this  time  were  rushing  in  on  the
buying side.

These  quotations  well  illustrate  the  confusion  that  has  been
dominant for many years in the use of the words investment and
speculation. Think of our suggested definition of investment given
above, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an
inexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what
he  is  selling,  and  has  some  largely  emotional  conviction  that  he
will be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-
evant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market
had already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-
ting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time
as possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used
phrase “reckless investors” could be regarded as a laughable con-
tradiction  in  terms—something  like  “spendthrift  misers”—were
this misuse of language not so mischievous.

The  newspaper  employed  the  word  “investor”  in  these
instances  because,  in  the  easy  language  of  Wall  Street,  everyone
who buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of
what he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for
cash  or  on  margin.  Compare  this  with  the  attitude  of  the  public
toward  common  stocks  in  1948,  when  over  90%  of  those  queried
expressed  themselves  as  opposed  to  the  purchase  of  common
stocks.3 About half gave as their reason “not safe, a gamble,” and
about  half,  the  reason  “not  familiar  with.”*  It  is  indeed  ironical

* The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of
Michigan  and  was  published  in  the  Federal  Reserve  Bulletin, July,  1948.
People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He
can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think
would be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays—put it in
the bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common
stock with it?” Only 4% thought common stock would offer a “satisfactory”
return;  26%  considered  it  “not  safe”  or  a  “gamble.”  From  1949  through
1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,

20

(though not surprising) that common-stock purchases of all kinds
were  quite  generally  regarded  as  highly  speculative  or  risky  at  a
time  when  they  were  selling  on  a  most  attractive  basis,  and  due
soon to begin their greatest advance in history; conversely the very
fact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev-
els as judged by past experience later transformed them into “invest-
ments,” and the entire stock-buying public into “investors.”

The distinction between investment and speculation in common
stocks  has  always  been  a  useful  one  and  its  disappearance  is  a
cause for concern. We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-
tion  would  be  well  advised  to  reinstate  this  distinction  and  to
emphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock
exchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,
which  those  who  suffered  them  had  not  been  properly  warned
against. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-
rassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from
the  inclusion  of  speculative  common  stocks  in  their  own  capital
funds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably
clear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-
ments—risks  which  are  inseparable  from  the  opportunities  of
profit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the
investor’s calculations.

What  we  have  just  said  indicates  that  there  may  no  longer  be
such a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-
sentative common stocks—in the sense that one can always wait to
buy  them  at  a  price  that  involves  no  risk  of  a  market  or  “quota-
tional”  loss  large  enough  to  be  disquieting.  In  most  periods  the
investor  must  recognize  the  existence  of  a  speculative  factor in  his
common-stock  holdings.  It  is  his  task  to  keep  this  component
within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-
ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.

Two  paragraphs  should  be  added  about  stock  speculation  per
se, as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent

averaging 18.7% annually. In a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a
poll conducted by BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of
investors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios,
down from 47% just three years earlier.

in  most  representative  common  stocks.  Outright  speculation  is 
neither  illegal,  immoral,  nor  (for  most  people)  fattening  to  the
pocketbook.  More  than  that,  some  speculation  is  necessary  and
unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-
stantial  possibilities  of  both  profit  and  loss,  and  the  risks  therein
must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as
there  is  intelligent  investing.  But  there  are  many  ways  in  which
speculation  may  be  unintelligent.  Of  these  the  foremost  are:  (1)
speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-
ously  instead  of  as  a  pastime,  when  you  lack  proper  knowledge
and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you
can afford to lose.

In  our  conservative  view  every  nonprofessional  who  operates
on margin† should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating, and it
is  his  broker’s  duty  so  to  advise  him. And  everyone  who  buys  a
so-called  “hot”  common-stock  issue,  or  makes  a  purchase  in  any
way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation
is always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead
of the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—
the  smaller  the  better—of  your  capital  in  a  separate  fund  for  this
purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the

* Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without speculation, untested
new  companies  (like  Amazon.com  or,  in  earlier  times,  the  Edison  Electric
Light Co.) would never be able to raise the necessary capital for expansion.
The alluring, long-shot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates
the  machinery  of  innovation.  Secondly,  risk  is  exchanged  (but  never  elimi-
nated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary
risk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual
risk—the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!
† A margin  account  enables  you  to  buy  stocks  using  money  you  borrow
from the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more
when your stocks go up—but you can be wiped out when they go down. The
collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your account—so you
must put up more money if that value falls below the amount you borrowed.

market  has  gone  up  and  profits  are  rolling  in.  (That’s  the  time  to
think of taking money out of your speculative fund.) Never mingle
your  speculative  and  investment  operations  in  the  same  account,
nor in any part of your thinking.

Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor

We have  already  defined  the  defensive  investor  as  one  inter-
ested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother. In general what
course  should  he  follow  and  what  return  can  he  expect  under
“average  normal  conditions”—if  such  conditions  really  exist?  To
answer  these  questions  we  shall  consider  first  what  we  wrote  on
the  subject  seven  years  ago,  next  what  significant  changes  have
occurred  since  then  in  the  underlying  factors  governing  the
investor’s  expectable  return,  and  finally  what  he  should  do  and
what he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.

1. What We Said Six Years Ago

We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between
high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion
held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the
converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;
that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion
between  the  two,  with  adjustments  to  restore  the  equality  when
market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As
an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock
component  to  25%  “if  he  felt  the  market  was  dangerously  high,”
and  conversely  to  advance  it  toward  the  maximum  of  75%  “if  he
felt  that  a  decline  in  stock  prices  was  making  them  increasingly
attractive.”

In 1965 the investor could obtain about 41⁄2% on high-grade tax-
able bonds and 31⁄4% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return
on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about
3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at
normal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain
an  initial  dividend  return  of  between  31⁄2%  and  41⁄2%  on  his  stock
purchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-
ing  value  (and  in  the  “normal  market  price”)  of  a  representative

Investment versus Speculation

23

stock  list  of  about  the  same  amount,  giving  a  return  from  divi-
dends and appreciation combined of about 71⁄2% per year. The half
and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%
before  income  tax.  We  added  that  the  stock  component  should
carry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power
caused by large-scale inflation.

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  above  arithmetic  indicated
expectation  of  a  much  lower  rate  of  advance  in  the  stock  market
than had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-
aged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it
was quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly
satisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people
were willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate
of advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”
and hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not
very good but bad results for the future.” 4

2. What Has Happened Since 1964

The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on
first-grade  bonds  to  record  high  levels,  although  there  has  since
been  a  considerable  recovery  from  the  lowest  prices  of  1970.  The
obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄2% and
even  more  against  41⁄2%  in  1964.  In  the  meantime  the  dividend
return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-
ket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is
less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going
interest  rates  produced  a  maximum  decline  of  about  38%  in  the
market  price  of  medium-term  (say  20-year)  bonds  during  this
period.

There is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we
discussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be
too high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not
consider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to
the  price  of  high-grade  bonds.  (Neither  did  anyone  else  that  we
know of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary
widely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light
of  what  has  since  happened  we  think  that  this  warning—with
attendant examples—was insufficiently stressed. For the fact is that

24

The Intelligent Investor

if the investor had a given sum in the DJIA at its closing price of
874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971;
even at the lowest level (631) in 1970 his indicated loss would have
been less than that shown on good long-term bonds. On the other
hand, if he had confined his bond-type investments to U.S. savings
bonds, short-term corporate issues, or savings accounts, he would
have had no loss in market value of his principal during this period
and  he  would  have  enjoyed  a  higher  income  return  than  was
offered  by  good  stocks.  It  turned  out,  therefore,  that  true  “cash
equivalents” proved to be better investments in 1964 than common
stocks—in  spite  of  the  inflation  experience  that  in  theory  should
have  favored  stocks  over  cash.  The  decline  in  quoted  principal
value of good longer-term bonds was due to developments in the
money market, an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an
important bearing on the investment policy of individuals.

This is just another of an endless series of experiences over time
that have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never
predictable.* Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than
stock prices, and investors generally could buy good bonds of any
maturity  without  having  to  worry  about  changes  in  their  market
value. There were a few exceptions to this rule, and the period after
1964  proved  to  be  one  of  them.  We  shall  have  more  to  say  about
change in bond prices in a later chapter.

3. Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972

Toward  the  end  of  1971  it  was  possible  to  obtain  8%  taxable
interest on good medium-term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free
on good state or municipal securities. In the shorter-term field the
investor could realize about 6% on U.S. government issues due in
five years. In the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about

* Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of investing 
experts is saying: The future of security prices is never predictable. And as
you read ahead in the book, notice how everything else Graham tells you is
designed to help you grapple with that truth. Since you cannot predict the
behavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own
behavior.

a possible loss in market value, since he is sure of full repayment,
including  the  6%  interest  return,  at  the  end  of  a  comparatively
short holding period. The DJIA at its recurrent price level of 900 in
1971 yields only 3.5%.

Let us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision
to  be  made  is  how  to  divide  the  fund  between  high-grade  bonds
(or  other  so-called  “cash  equivalents”)  and  leading  DJIA-type
stocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-
ditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant
upward or a significant downward movement for some time in the
future?  First  let  us  point  out  that  if  there  is  no  serious  adverse
change, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-
rent  3.5%  dividend  return  on  his  stocks  and  also  on  an  average
annual  appreciation  of  about  4%.  As  we  shall  explain  later  this
appreciation  is  based  essentially  on  the  reinvestment  by  the  vari-
ous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-
tributed  profits.  On  a  before-tax  basis  the  combined  return  of  his
stocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-
est on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return
on stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5 This would be about the
same as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.

These  expectations  are  much  less  favorable  for  stocks  against
bonds  than  they  were  in  our  1964  analysis.  (That  conclusion  fol-
lows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up
much more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight

* How  well  did  Graham’s  forecast  pan  out?  At  first  blush,  it  seems,  very
well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned
an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period
for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-
year  time  horizon.)  However,  inflation  raged  at  8.6%  annually  over  this
period, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his
chapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation,”
which essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the
current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield
of  just  under  2%  in  early  2003,  and  long-term  earnings  growth  of  around
2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly
6% is plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)

26

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds
are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-
dends  and  price  appreciation  on  stocks.  Consequently  we  are
forced  to  the  conclusion  that  now,  toward  the  end  of  1971,  bond
investment  appears  clearly  preferable  to  stock  investment.  If  we
could be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise
the  defensive  investor  to  put  all his  money  in  bonds  and  none in
common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-
cantly in favor of stocks.

But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-
ter  than  stocks  from  today’s  levels.  The  reader  will  immediately
think of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In
the  next  chapter  we  shall  argue  that  our  considerable  experience
with inflation in the United States during this century would not
support the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials
in yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider it
remote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another
would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a
fixed  amount  of  dollars.*  There  is  the  alternative  possibility—
which  we  also  consider  highly  unlikely—that American  business
will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-
tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.
Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness
another  great  speculative  rise  in  the  stock  market  without  a  real
justification  in  the  underlying  values.  Any  of  these  reasons,  and
perhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to
regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable
yield levels.

Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-
ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy

* Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were
introduced,  stocks  have  no  longer  been  the  automatically  superior  choice
for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise
in  value  if  the  Consumer  Price  Index  goes  up,  effectively  immunizing  the
investor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee
and, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For
more details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)

for defensive investors—namely that at all times they have a signif-
icant  part  of  their  funds  in  bond-type  holdings  and  a  significant
part  also  in  equities.  It  is  still  true  that  they  may  choose  between
maintaining a simple 50–50 division between the two components
or a ratio, dependent on their judgment, varying between a mini-
mum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of either. We shall give our
more detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.

Since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks
is  nearly  the  same  as  that  from  bonds,  the  presently  expectable
return  (including  growth  of  stock  values)  for  the  investor  would
change  little  regardless  of  how  he  divides  his  fund  between  the
two  components. As  calculated  above,  the  aggregate  return  from
both parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free
(or estimated tax-paid) basis. A return of this order is appreciably
higher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over
most of the long-term past. It may not seem attractive in relation to
the  14%,  or  so,  return  shown  by  common  stocks  during  the  20
years of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be
remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIA had
advanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had
about  doubled.  Hence  the  greater  part  of  the  impressive  market
record  for  that  period  was  based  on  a  change  in  investors’  and
speculators’  attitudes  rather  than  in  underlying  corporate  values.
To that extent it might well be called a “bootstrap operation.”

In  discussing  the  common-stock  portfolio  of  the  defensive
investor,  we  have  spoken  only  of  leading  issues  of  the  type
included in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age. We have done this for convenience, and not to imply that these
30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him. Actually, there are
many other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average
of the Dow Jones list; these would include a host of public utilities
(which have a separate Dow Jones average to represent them).* But

* Today,  the  most  widely  available  alternatives  to  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial
Average are the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index (the “S & P”) and the
Wilshire 5000 index. The S & P focuses on 500 large, well-known compa-
nies that make up roughly 70% of the total value of the U.S. equity market.
The  Wilshire  5000  follows  the  returns  of  nearly  every  significant,  publicly

28

the major point here is that the defensive investor’s overall results
are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep-
resentative  list  than  from  another,  or—more  accurately—that  nei-
ther  he  nor  his  advisers  could  predict  with  certainty  whatever
differences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of skill-
ful  or  shrewd  investment  is  supposed  to  lie  particularly  in  the
selection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-
ket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the
ability  of  defensive  investors  generally  to  get  better  than  average
results—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-
formance.*  (Our  skepticism  extends  to  the  management  of  large
funds by experts.)

Let us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem
to prove the opposite. Between December 1960 and December 1970
the DJIA advanced from 616 to 839, or 36%. But in the same period
the  much  larger  Standard  &  Poor’s  weighted  index  of  500  stocks
rose from 58.11 to 92.15, or 58%. Obviously the second group had
proved a better “buy” than the first. But who would have been so
rash  as  to  predict  in  1960  that  what  seemed  like  a  miscellaneous
assortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper-
form the aristocratic “thirty tyrants” of the Dow? All this proves,
we  insist,  that  only  rarely  can  one  make  dependable  predictions
about price changes, absolute or relative.

We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot
be  given  too  often—that  the  investor  cannot  hope  for  better  than
average  results  by  buying  new  offerings,  or  “hot”  issues  of  any
sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.† The
contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive
investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
condition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such

traded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-
nies  account  for  most  of  the  total  value  of  the  index,  the  return  of  the
Wilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500. Several low-
cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a
single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)

a  list.)  Aggressive  investors  may  buy  other  types  of  common
stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-
lished by intelligent analysis.

To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-
tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the
purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might
also  utilize  one  of  the  “common  trust  funds,”  or  “commingled
funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,
if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-
ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration
of  his  investment  program  along  standard  lines.  The  third  is  the
device  of  “dollar-cost  averaging,”  which  means  simply  that  the
practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when
the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up
with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-
ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as
“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-
gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks
between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-
tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the
defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later
chapters.*

Results to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor

Our  enterprising  security  buyer,  of  course,  will  desire  and
expect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive
companion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be
worse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,
and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead
of  profits.  These  virtues,  if  channeled  in  the  wrong  directions,
become indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential
that  the  enterprising  investor  start  with  a  clear  conception  as  to

“Professional  administration”  by  “a  recognized  investment-counsel  firm”  is
discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.

30

The Intelligent Investor

which  courses  of  action  offer  reasonable  chances  of  success  and
which do not.

First let us consider several ways in which investors and specu-
lators  generally  have  endeavored  to  obtain  better  than  average
results. These include:

1. Trading  in  the  market. This  usually  means  buying  stocks
when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has
turned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those
which  have  been  “behaving”  better  than  the  market  average.  A
small  number  of  professionals  frequently  engage  in  short  selling.
Here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the
established  mechanism  of  the  stock  exchanges.  Their  object  is  to
benefit  from  a  subsequent  decline  in  the  price  of  these  issues,  by
buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for. (As our
quotation  from  the  Wall  Street  Journal on  p.  19  indicates,  even
“small investors”—perish the term!—sometimes try their unskilled
hand at short selling.)

2. Short-term selectivity. This means buying stocks of compa-
nies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings,
or for which some other favorable development is anticipated.

3. Long-term  selectivity.  Here  the  usual  emphasis  is  on  an
excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-
tinue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose
companies  which  have  not  yet  shown  impressive  results,  but  are
expected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies
belong  frequently  in  some  technological  area—e.g.,  computers,
drugs,  electronics—and  they  often  are  developing  new  processes
or products that are deemed to be especially promising.)

We have already expressed a negative view about the investor’s
overall  chances  of  success  in  these  areas  of  activity.  The  first  we
have ruled out, on both theoretical and realistic grounds, from the
domain of investment. Stock trading is not an operation “which, on
thorough  analysis,  offers  safety  of  principal  and  a  satisfactory
return.” More will be said on stock trading in a later chapter.*

* See Chapter 8.

Investment versus Speculation

31

In his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the
near term or the longer future, the investor faces obstacles of two
kinds—the  first  stemming  from  human  fallibility  and  the  second
from  the  nature  of  his  competition.  He  may  be  wrong  in  his  esti-
mate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price
may  already  fully  reflect  what  he  is  anticipating.  In  the  area  of
near-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are
generally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to
the extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-
ered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of
this year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for
next year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for
the same reason.

In  choosing  stocks  for  their  long-term prospects,  the  investor’s
handicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error
in the prediction—which we illustrated by our airlines example on
p. 6—is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-
ings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is
theoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making
correct predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect
ones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors
could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-
fessional  analysts  at  their  favorite  game  of  estimating  long-term
future earnings?

We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-
sion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average
results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently
sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.

Are  there  any  such  policies  available  for  the  enterprising
investor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there
are broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in
practice  as  well.  Everyone  knows  that  speculative  stock  move-
ments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-
eral  market  and  at  all  times  in  at  least  some  of  the  individual
issues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because
of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-
ther  and  assert  that  in  an  astonishingly  large  proportion  of  the
trading in common stocks, those engaged therein don’t appear to
know—in polite terms—one part of their anatomy from another. In
this  book  we  shall  point  out  numerous  examples  of  (past)  dis-

32

The Intelligent Investor

crepancies between price and value. Thus it seems that any intelli-
gent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable
picnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness. So it
seems, but somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neg-
lected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves
a  protracted  and  patience-trying  experience.  And  selling  short  a
too popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not
only  of  one’s  courage  and  stamina  but  also  of  the  depth  of  one’s
pocketbook.*  The  principle  is  sound,  its  successful  application  is
not impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.

There is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which
over many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return
of 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew
their  way  around  in  this  field.  They  include  intersecurity  arbi-
trages,  payouts  or  workouts  in  liquidations,  protected  hedges  of
certain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-
sition  which  offers  a  substantially  higher  value  for  certain  shares
than their price on the date of the announcement. The number of
such  deals  increased  greatly  in  recent  years,  and  it  should  have
been  a  highly  profitable  period  for  the  cognoscenti.  But  with  the
multiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of
obstacles  to  mergers  and  of  deals  that  didn’t  go  through;  quite  a
few  individual  losses  were  thus  realized  in  these  once-reliable
operations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished
by too much competition.†

* In  “selling  short”  (or  “shorting”)  a  stock,  you  make  a  bet  that  its  share 
price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-
row  shares  from  someone  who  owns  them;  then  you  immediately  sell  the
borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the
stock  drops,  you  will  be  able  to  buy  your  replacement  shares  at  a  lower
price.  The  difference  between  the  price  at  which  you  sold  your  borrowed
shares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit
(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs). How-
ever,  if  the  stock  goes  up  in  price  instead  of  down,  your  potential  loss  is
unlimited—making short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual
investors.
† In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts
multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to profit from any

Investment versus Speculation

33

The lessened profitability of these special situations appears one
manifestation of a kind of self-destructive process—akin to the law
of diminishing returns—which has developed during the lifetime
of this book. In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-
tuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula—
based  on  earnings  and  current  interest  rates—for  determining  a
level  to  buy  the  DJIA below  its  “central”  or  “intrinsic”  value, 
and to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-
erning maxim of the Rothschilds: “Buy cheap and sell dear.”* And
it had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained
and pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought
because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.
Alas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. A second illustra-
tion  is  provided  by  the  famous  “Dow  Theory”  of  stock-market
movements,  in  a  comparison  of  its  indicated  splendid  results  for
1897–1933  and  its  much  more  questionable  performance  since
1934.

A third  and  final  example  of  the  golden  opportunities  not
recently  available:  A good  part  of  our  own  operations  on  Wall
Street had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issues eas-
ily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than
their  share  in  the  net  current  assets  (working  capital)  alone,  not
counting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all
liabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling
at a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-
ness. No proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what
he owned at so ridiculously low a figure. Strangely enough, such

errors in pricing these complex deals. They became so good at it that the
easy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down.
Although Graham does discuss it again (see pp. 174–175), this sort of trad-
ing  is  no  longer  feasible  or  appropriate  for  most  people,  since  only  multi-
million-dollar  trades  are  large  enough  to  generate  worthwhile  profits.
Wealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge
funds that specialize in merger or “event” arbitrage.
* The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the dominant
power  in  European  investment  banking  and  brokerage  in  the  nineteenth
century. For a brilliant history, see Niall Ferguson, The House of Rothschild:
Money’s Prophets, 1798–1848 (Viking, 1998).

anomalies were not hard to find. In 1957 a list was published show-
ing nearly 200 issues of this type available in the market. In various
ways practically all these bargain issues turned out to be profitable,
and  the  average  annual  result  proved  much  more  remunerative
than  most  other  investments.  But  they  too  virtually  disappeared
from the stock market in the next decade, and with them a depend-
able area for shrewd and successful operation by the enterprising
investor. However, at the low prices of 1970 there again appeared a
considerable  number  of  such  “sub-working-capital”  issues,  and
despite  the  strong  recovery  of  the  market,  enough  of  them
remained at the end of the year to make up a full-sized portfolio.

The enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has vari-
ous possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge
list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be
identified  as  undervalued  by  logical  and  reasonably  dependable
standards.  These  should  yield  more  satisfactory  results  on  the
average  than  will  the  DJIA or  any  similarly  representative  list.  In
our  view  the  search  for  these  would  not  be  worth  the  investor’s
effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the aver-
age annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio. We shall
try to develop one or more such approaches to stock selection for
use by the active investor.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 1

All of human unhappiness comes from one single thing: not
knowing how to remain at rest in a room.

—Blaise Pascal

Why do you suppose the brokers on the floor of the New York Stock

Exchange  always  cheer  at  the  sound  of  the  closing  bell—no  matter
what  the  market  did  that  day?  Because  whenever  you  trade,  they
make money—whether you did or not. By speculating instead of invest-
ing, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone
else’s.

Graham’s  definition  of  investing  could  not  be  clearer:  “An  invest-
ment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety
of principal and an adequate return.” 1 Note that investing, according to
Graham, consists equally of three elements:

•

•
•

you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its
underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;
you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;
you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.

1 Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his defini-
tion: “thorough analysis” means “the study of the facts in the light of estab-
lished  standards  of  safety  and  value”  while  “safety  of  principal”  signifies
“protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or
variations”  and  “adequate”  (or  “satisfactory”)  return  refers  to  “any  rate  or
amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, pro-
vided  he  acts  with  reasonable  intelligence.”  (Security  Analysis, 1934  ed.,
pp. 55–56).

Commentary on Chapter 1

An investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of
its businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price
because  somebody  else  will  pay  even  more  for  it.  As  Graham  once
put it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of
value,”  while  speculators  “base  [their]  standards  of  value  upon  the
market price.” 2 For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes
is  like  oxygen;  cut  it  off  and  he  dies.  For  an  investor,  what  Graham
called  “quotational”  values  matter  much  less.  Graham  urges  you  to
invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had
no way of knowing its daily share price.3

Like casino gambling or betting on the horses, speculating in the
market can be exciting or even rewarding (if you happen to get lucky).
But it’s the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That’s because
Wall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds
so  that  the  house  always  prevails,  in  the  end,  against  everyone  who
tries to beat the house at its own speculative game.

On the other hand, investing is a unique kind of casino—one where
you cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that
put the odds squarely in your favor. People who invest make money for
themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers. And
that,  in  turn,  is  why  Wall  Street  perennially  downplays  the  durable
virtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.

U N S A F E   A T   H I G H   S P E E D

Confusing  speculation  with  investment,  Graham  warns,  is  always  a
mistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction. Almost
everyone, it seems, ran out of patience at once, and America became
the  Speculation  Nation,  populated  with  traders  who  went  shooting
from  stock  to  stock  like  grasshoppers  whizzing  around  in  an  August
hay field.

People  began  believing  that  the  test  of  an  investment  technique
was  simply  whether  it  “worked.”  If  they  beat  the  market  over  any

for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on
these terms?” (Forbes, January 1, 1972, p. 90.)

period,  no  matter  how  dangerous  or  dumb  their  tactics,  people
boasted that they were “right.” But the intelligent investor has no inter-
est in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals,
you  must  be  sustainably  and  reliably  right.  The  techniques  that
became so trendy in the 1990s—day trading, ignoring diversification,
flipping hot mutual funds, following stock-picking “systems”—seemed
to work. But they had no chance of prevailing in the long run, because
they failed to meet all three of Graham’s criteria for investing.

To see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine
that  two  places  are  130  miles  apart.  If  I  observe  the  65-mph  speed
limit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I
can get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”? Should
you  be  tempted  to  try  it,  too,  because  you  hear  me  bragging  that  it
“worked”?  Flashy  gimmicks  for  beating  the  market  are  much  the
same: In short streaks, so long as your luck holds out, they work. Over
time, they will get you killed.

In  1973,  when  Graham  last  revised  The  Intelligent  Investor, the
annual  turnover  rate  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  was  20%,
meaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before
selling it. By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%—a holding period of
only 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a
stock  for  nearly  three  years;  by  2002,  that  ownership  period  had
shrunk  to  just  10.9  months.  It’s  as  if  mutual-fund  managers  were
studying  their  stocks  just  long  enough  to  learn  they  shouldn’t  have
bought them in the first place, then promptly dumping them and start-
ing all over.

Even  the  most  respected  money-management  firms  got  antsy.  In
early  1995,  Jeffrey  Vinik,  manager  of  Fidelity  Magellan  (then  the
world’s  largest  mutual  fund),  had  42.5%  of  its  assets  in  technology
stocks. Vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders “have invested
in the fund for goals that are years away. . . . I think their objectives are
the  same  as  mine,  and  that  they  believe,  as  I  do,  that  a  long-term
approach  is  best.”  But  six  months  after  he  wrote  those  high-minded
words, Vinik sold off almost all his technology shares, unloading nearly
$19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks. So much for the “long term”!
And by 1999, Fidelity’s discount brokerage division was egging on its
clients to trade anywhere, anytime, using a Palm handheld computer—
which was perfectly in tune with the firm’s new slogan, “Every second
counts.”

And  on  the  NASDAQ  exchange,  turnover  hit  warp  speed,  as  Fig-

ure 1-1 shows.4

In 1999, shares in Puma Technology, for instance, changed hands
an  average  of  once  every  5.7  days.  Despite  NASDAQ’s  grandiose
motto—“The  Stock  Market  for  the  Next  Hundred  Years”—many  of  its
customers could barely hold on to a stock for a hundred hours.

Morgan  Stanley,  ran  a  TV  commercial  in  which  a  scruffy  tow-truck
driver picks up a prosperous-looking executive. Spotting a photo of a
tropical  beachfront  posted  on  the  dashboard,  the  executive  asks,
“Vacation?”  “Actually,”  replies  the  driver,  “that’s  my  home.”  Taken
aback,  the  suit  says,  “Looks  like  an  island.”  With  quiet  triumph,  the
driver answers, “Technically, it’s a country.”

The  propaganda  went  further.  Online  trading  would  take  no  work
and  require  no  thought.  A  television  ad  from  Ameritrade,  the  online
broker, showed two housewives just back from jogging; one logs on
to her computer, clicks the mouse a few times, and exults, “I think I just
made about $1,700!” In a TV commercial for the Waterhouse broker-
age  firm,  someone  asked  basketball  coach  Phil  Jackson,  “You  know
anything  about  the  trade?”  His  answer:  “I’m  going  to  make  it  right
now.” (How many games would Jackson’s NBA teams have won if he
had brought that philosophy to courtside? Somehow, knowing noth-
ing  about  the  other  team,  but  saying,  “I’m  ready  to  play  them  right
now,” doesn’t sound like a championship formula.)

By 1999 at least six million people were trading online—and roughly
a tenth of them were “day trading,” using the Internet to buy and sell
stocks  at  lightning  speed.  Everyone  from  showbiz  diva  Barbra
Streisand to Nicholas Birbas, a 25-year-old former waiter in Queens,
New York, was flinging stocks around like live coals. “Before,” scoffed
Birbas, “I was investing for the long term and I found out that it was not
smart.” Now, Birbas traded stocks up to 10 times a day and expected
to earn $100,000 in a year. “I can’t stand to see red in my profit-or-loss
column,” Streisand shuddered in an interview with Fortune. “I’m Taurus
the bull, so I react to red. If I see red, I sell my stocks quickly.” 5

By  pouring  continuous  data  about  stocks  into  bars  and  barber-
shops,  kitchens  and  cafés,  taxicabs  and  truck  stops,  financial  web-
sites and financial TV turned the stock market into a nonstop national
video  game.  The  public  felt  more  knowledgeable  about  the  markets
than ever before. Unfortunately, while people were drowning in data,
knowledge was nowhere to be found. Stocks became entirely decou-

pled from the companies that had issued them—pure abstractions, just
blips moving across a TV or computer screen. If the blips were moving
up, nothing else mattered.

On December 20, 1999, Juno Online Services unveiled a trailblaz-
ing  business  plan:  to  lose  as  much  money  as  possible,  on  purpose.
Juno announced that it would henceforth offer all its retail services for
free—no  charge  for  e-mail,  no  charge  for  Internet  access—and  that  it
would spend millions of dollars more on advertising over the next year.
On this declaration of corporate hara-kiri, Juno’s stock roared up from
$16.375 to $66.75 in two days.6

Why  bother  learning  whether  a  business  was  profitable,  or  what
goods or services a company produced, or who its management was,
or  even  what  the  company’s  name  was?  All  you  needed  to  know
about stocks was the catchy code of their ticker symbols: CBLT, INKT,
PCLN,  TGLO,  VRSN,  WBVN.7 That  way  you  could  buy  them  even
faster, without the pesky two-second delay of looking them up on an
Internet search engine. In late 1998, the stock of a tiny, rarely traded
building-maintenance  company,  Temco  Services,  nearly  tripled  in  a
matter  of  minutes  on  record-high  volume.  Why?  In  a  bizarre  form  of
financial dyslexia, thousands of traders bought Temco after mistaking
its ticker symbol, TMCO, for that of Ticketmaster Online (TMCS), an
Internet  darling  whose  stock  began  trading  publicly  for  the  first  time
that day.8

Oscar Wilde joked that a cynic “knows the price of everything, and
the value of nothing.” Under that definition, the stock market is always
cynical, but by the late 1990s it would have shocked Oscar himself. A
single  half-baked  opinion  on  price could  double  a  company’s  stock
even as its value went entirely unexamined. In late 1998, Henry Blod-
get, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, warned that “as with all Inter-
net  stocks,  a  valuation  is  clearly  more  art  than  science.”  Then,  citing
only the possibility of future growth, he jacked up his “price target” on

7 A  ticker  symbol  is  an  abbreviation,  usually  one  to  four  letters  long,  of  a
company’s name used as shorthand to identify a stock for trading purposes.
8 This was not an isolated incident; on at least three other occasions in the
late 1990s, day traders sent the wrong stock soaring when they mistook its
ticker symbol for that of a newly minted Internet company.

Amazon.com from $150 to $400 in one fell swoop. Amazon.com shot
up 19% that day and—despite Blodget’s protest that his price target
was a one-year forecast—soared past $400 in just three weeks. A year
later,  PaineWebber  analyst  Walter  Piecyk  predicted  that  Qualcomm
stock would hit $1,000 a share over the next 12 months. The stock—
already  up  1,842%  that  year—soared  another  31%  that  day,  hitting
$659 a share.9

But  trading  as  if  your  underpants  are  on  fire  is  not  the  only  form  of
speculation.  Throughout  the  past  decade  or  so,  one  speculative  for-
mula after another was promoted, popularized, and then thrown aside.
All of them shared a few traits—This is quick! This is easy! And it won’t
hurt a bit!—and all of them violated at least one of Graham’s distinc-
tions between investing and speculating. Here are a few of the trendy
formulas that fell flat:

•

Cash  in  on  the  calendar. The  “January  effect”—the  tendency  of
small  stocks  to  produce  big  gains  around  the  turn  of  the  year—
was widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub-
lished in the 1980s. These studies showed that if you piled into
small stocks in the second half of December and held them into
January,  you  would  beat  the  market  by  five  to  10  percentage
points.  That  amazed  many  experts.  After  all,  if  it  were  this  easy,
surely  everyone  would  hear  about  it,  lots  of  people  would  do  it,
and the opportunity would wither away.

What caused the January jolt? First of all, many investors sell
their crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can
cut  their  tax  bills.  Second,  professional  money  managers  grow
more cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve
their  outperformance  (or  minimize  their  underperformance).  That
makes them reluctant to buy (or even hang on to) a falling stock.
And  if  an  underperforming  stock  is  also  small  and  obscure,  a
money manager will be even less eager to show it in his year-end

85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.

list of holdings. All these factors turn small stocks into momentary
bargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-
cally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.

The January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.
According to finance professor William Schwert of the University of
Rochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and
sold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5
percentage  points  from  1962  through  1979,  by  4.4  points  from
1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.10
As more people learned about the January effect, more traders
bought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain
and thus reducing their returns. Also, the January effect is biggest
among  the  smallest  stocks—but  according  to  Plexus  Group,  the
leading authority on brokerage expenses, the total cost of buying
and  selling  such  tiny  stocks  can  run  up  to  8%  of  your  invest-
ment.11 Sadly, by the time you’re done paying your broker, all your
gains on the January effect will melt away.
Just  do  “what  works.” In  1996,  an  obscure  money  manager
named  James  O’Shaughnessy  published  a  book  called  What
Works  on  Wall  Street.
In  it,  he  argued  that  “investors  can  do
much  better than  the  market.”  O’Shaughnessy  made  a  stunning
claim: From 1954 through 1994, you could have turned $10,000
into $8,074,504, beating the market by more than 10-fold—a tow-
ering 18.2% average annual return. How? By buying a basket of
50 stocks with the highest one-year returns, five straight years of
rising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5 times their corpo-
rate  revenues.12 As  if  he  were  the  Edison  of  Wall  Street,
O’Shaughnessy obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,978,778 for his “auto-
mated  strategies”  and  launched  a  group  of  four  mutual  funds
based on his findings. By late 1999 the funds had sucked in more
than  $175  million  from  the  public—and,  in  his  annual  letter  to
shareholders, O’Shaughnessy stated grandly: “As always, I hope

Market Efficiency,” available at http://schwert.ssb.rochester.edu/papers.htm.

that  together,  we  can  reach  our  long-term  goals  by  staying  the
course and sticking with our time-tested investment strategies.”

But  “what  works  on  Wall  Street”  stopped  working  right  after
O’Shaughnessy  publicized  it.  As  Figure  1-2  shows,  two  of  his
funds stank so badly that they shut down in early 2000, and the

overall stock market (as measured by the S & P 500 index) wal-
loped every O’Shaughnessy fund almost nonstop for nearly four
years running.

In June 2000, O’Shaughnessy moved closer to his own “long-
term goals” by turning the funds over to a new manager, leaving
his  customers  to  fend  for  themselves  with  those  “time-tested
investment  strategies.” 13 O’Shaughnessy’s  shareholders  might
have  been  less  upset  if  he  had  given  his  book  a  more  precise
title—for instance, What Used to Work on Wall Street . . . Until I
Wrote This Book.
Follow  “The  Foolish  Four.” In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Motley  Fool
website  (and  several  books)  hyped  the  daylights  out  of  a  tech-
nique called “The Foolish Four.” According to the Motley Fool, you
would have “trashed the market averages over the last 25 years”
and could “crush your mutual funds” by spending “only 15 min-
utes a year” on planning your investments. Best of all, this tech-
nique had “minimal risk.” All you needed to do was this:

•

1. Take the five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average with

the lowest stock prices and highest dividend yields.

2. Discard the one with the lowest price.
3. Put 40% of your money in the stock with the second-lowest

price.

4. Put 20% in each of the three remaining stocks.
5. One  year  later,  sort  the  Dow  the  same  way  and  reset  the

portfolio according to steps 1 through 4.

6. Repeat until wealthy.

Over a 25-year period, the Motley Fool claimed, this technique
would have beaten the market by a remarkable 10.1 percentage

13 In  a  remarkable  irony,  the  surviving  two  O’Shaughnessy  funds  (now
known  as  the  Hennessy  funds)  began  performing  quite  well  just  as
O’Shaughnessy  announced  that  he  was  turning  over  the  management  to
another company. The funds’ shareholders were furious. In a chat room at
www.morningstar.com, one fumed: “I guess ‘long term’ for O’S is 3 years.
. . . I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O’S’s method. . . . I had told several
friends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they didn’t act on my
advice.”

points  annually.  Over  the  next  two  decades,  they  suggested,
$20,000  invested  in  The  Foolish  Four  should  flower  into
$1,791,000. (And, they claimed, you could do still better by pick-
ing the five Dow stocks with the highest ratio of dividend yield to
the square root of stock price, dropping the one that scored the
highest, and buying the next four.)

Let’s  consider  whether  this  “strategy”  could  meet  Graham’s

definitions of an investment:

• What  kind  of  “thorough  analysis”  could  justify  discarding  the
stock  with  the  single  most  attractive  price  and  dividend—but
keeping the four that score lower for those desirable qualities?
• How could putting 40% of your money into only one stock be a

“minimal risk”?

• And  how  could  a  portfolio  of  only  four  stocks  be  diversified

enough to provide “safety of principal”?

The  Foolish  Four,  in  short,  was  one  of  the  most  cockamamie
stock-picking formulas ever concocted. The Fools made the same
mistake as O’Shaughnessy: If you look at a large quantity of data
long  enough,  a  huge  number  of  patterns  will  emerge—if  only  by
chance.  By  random  luck  alone,  the  companies  that  produce
above-average stock returns will have plenty of things in common.
But  unless  those  factors  cause the  stocks  to  outperform,  they
can’t be used to predict future returns.

None  of  the  factors  that  the  Motley  Fools  “discovered”  with
such fanfare—dropping the stock with the best score, doubling up
on the one with the second-highest score, dividing the dividend
yield  by  the  square  root  of  stock  price—could  possibly  cause  or
explain the future performance of a stock. Money Magazine found
that  a  portfolio  made  up  of  stocks  whose  names  contained  no
repeating  letters  would  have  performed  nearly  as  well  as  The
Foolish Four—and for the same reason: luck alone.14 As Graham
never  stops  reminding  us,  stocks  do  well  or  poorly  in  the  future
because the businesses behind them do well or poorly—nothing
more, and nothing less.

14 See  Jason  Zweig,  “False  Profits,”  Money, August,  1999,  pp.  55–57.  A
thorough discussion of The Foolish Four can also be found at www.investor
home.com/fool.htm.

Commentary on Chapter 1

Sure enough, instead of crushing the market, The Foolish Four
crushed the thousands of people who were fooled into believing
that  it  was  a  form  of  investing.  In  2000  alone,  the  four  Foolish
stocks—Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, SBC, and General Motors—
lost 14% while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%.

As these examples show, there’s only one thing that never suffers a
bear  market  on  Wall  Street:  dopey  ideas.  Each  of  these  so-called
investing approaches fell prey to Graham’s Law. All mechanical formu-
las for earning higher stock performance are “a kind of self-destructive
process—akin to the law of diminishing returns.” There are two reasons
the returns fade away. If the formula was just based on random statis-
tical  flukes  (like  The  Foolish  Four),  the  mere  passage  of  time  will
expose that it made no sense in the first place. On the other hand, if
the formula actually did work in the past (like the January effect), then
by publicizing it, market pundits always erode—and usually eliminate—
its ability to do so in the future.

All  this  reinforces  Graham’s  warning  that  you  must  treat  specula-

tion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:

•

•

•

You must never delude yourself into thinking that you’re investing
when you’re speculating.
Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin
to take it seriously.
You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.

Just as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor
and leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room,
the intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as
a “mad money” account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is
the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Never min-
gle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your invest-
ment accounts; never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into
your investing activities; and never put more than 10% of your assets
into your mad money account, no matter what happens.

For better or worse, the gambling instinct is part of human nature—
so it’s futile for most people even to try suppressing it. But you must
confine and restrain it. That’s the single best way to make sure you will
never fool yourself into confusing speculation with investment.

CHAPTER 2

The Investor and Inflation

Inflation,  and  the  fight  against  it,  has  been  very  much  in  the
public’s  mind  in  recent  years.  The  shrinkage  in  the  purchasing
power of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope
by  speculators)  of  a  serious  further  decline  in  the  future,  has
greatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those
with  a  fixed  dollar  income  will  suffer  when  the  cost  of  living
advances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-
pal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a
loss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in
their dividends and the prices of their shares.

On the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities
have concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form
of  investment,  and  (2)  consequently,  common  stocks  are  by  their
very  nature  more  desirable  investments  than  bonds.  We  have
heard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios
should consist 100% of stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is
quite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were

* By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a foundation
or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had spread to indi-
vidual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994 edition of his influ-
ential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the
Wharton  School  recommended  that  “risk-taking”  investors  should  buy  on
margin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their
assets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February
1999,  the  Honorable  Richard  Dixon,  state  treasurer  of  Maryland,  told  the
audience at an investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for any-
one to have any money in a bond fund.”

47

The Intelligent Investor

restricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice preferred
stocks).

Our  readers  must  have  enough  intelligence  to  recognize  that
even  high-quality  stocks  cannot  be  a  better  purchase  than  bonds
under  all  conditions—i.e.,  regardless  of  how  high  the  stock  market
may be and how low the current dividend return compared with
the rates available on bonds. A statement of this kind would be as
absurd as was the contrary one—too often heard years ago—that
any  bond  is  safer  than  any  stock.  In  this  chapter  we  shall  try  to
apply  various  measurements  to  the  inflation  factor,  in  order  to
reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may
wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the
price level.

In this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our
views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-
tion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it
has taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-
tions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them
in confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a
condensed  historical  tabulation  that  contains  much  information
about changes in the general price level and concomitant changes
in  the  earnings  and  market  value  of  common  stocks.  Our  figures
will  begin  with  1915,  and  thus  cover  55  years,  presented  at  five-
year intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of
wartime price controls.)

The  first  thing  we  notice  is  that  we  have  had  inflation  in  the
past—lots  of  it.  The  largest  five-year  dose  was  between  1915  and
1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with
the advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have
had  three  periods  of  declining  prices  and  then  six  of  advances  at
varying  rates,  some  rather  small.  On  this  showing,  the  investor
should clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent
inflation to come.

Can  we  tell  what  the  rate  of  inflation  is  likely  to  be?  No  clear
answer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It
would seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-
sistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the
consumer  price  level  for  this  period  has  been  2.5%;  that  for
1965–1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%. Official govern-

The Intelligent Investor

ment  policy  has  been  strongly  against  large-scale  inflation,  and
there are some reasons to believe that Federal policies will be more
effective in the future than in recent years.* We think it would be
reasonable  for  an  investor  at  this  point  to  base  his  thinking  and
decisions on a probable (far from certain) rate of future inflation of,
say,  3%  per  annum.  (This  would  compare  with  an  annual  rate  of
about 21⁄2% for the entire period 1915–1970.)1

What would be the implications of such an advance? It would
eat  up,  in  higher  living  costs,  about  one-half  the  income  now
obtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed
after-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would
be a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would
not  mean  that  the  true  value,  or  the  purchasing  power,  of  the
investor’s fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half
his  interest  income  after  taxes  he  would  maintain  this  buying
power intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.

But the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reason-
ably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than
high-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered
in  1970–1971?”  Would  not,  for  example,  an  all-stock  program  be
preferable  to  a  part-bond,  part-stock  program?  Do  not  common
stocks have a built-in protection against inflation, and are they not
almost  certain  to  give  a  better  return  over  the  years  than  will
bonds? Have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than
have bonds over the 55-year period of our study?

The answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Com-
mon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period
of time in the past. The rise of the DJIA from an average of 77 in
1915  to  an  average  of  753  in  1970  works  out  at  an  annual  com-
pounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%
for  average  dividend  return.  (The  corresponding  figures  for  the 
S & P composite are about the same.) These combined figures of 8%

* This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two years after
President  Richard  Nixon  imposed  wage  and  price  controls,  inflation  hit
8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The decade from 1973
through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern American history, as the
cost of living more than doubled.

per  year  are  of  course  much  better  than  the  return  enjoyed  from
bonds  over  the  same  55-year  period.  But  they  do  not  exceed  that
now offered by high-grade bonds. This brings us to the next logical
question:  Is  there  a  persuasive  reason  to  believe  that  common
stocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in
the last five and one-half decades?

Our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common
stocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far
from  certain  to  do  so.  We  must  deal  here  with  two  different  time
elements  in  investment  results.  The  first  covers  what  is  likely  to
occur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second
applies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially
and psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five
years or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his
satisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-
sions  what  to  do  next,  are  all  determined  not  in  the  retrospect  of 
a  lifetime  of  investment  but  rather  by  his  experience  from  year 
to year.

On this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-
nection  between  inflationary  (or  deflationary)  conditions  and  the
movement  of  common-stock  earnings  and  prices.  The  obvious
example is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-
ing was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But
both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since
1965.  There  are  similar  contradictions  in  both  directions  in  the
record of previous five-year periods.

Inflation and Corporate Earnings

Another  and  highly  important  approach  to  the  subject  is  by  a
study of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.
This  has  fluctuated,  of  course,  with  the  general  rate  of  economic
activity,  but  it  has  shown  no  general  tendency  to  advance  with
wholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen
rather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of
the period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of
more liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-
ies  have  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  investor  cannot  count  on
much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group—

52

The Intelligent Investor

about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares.2
Since  the  market  value  of  these  issues  is  well  above  their  book
value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on
current  market  price  work  out  only  at  some  61⁄4%.  (This  relation-
ship  is  generally  expressed  in  the  reverse,  or  “times  earnings,”
manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual
earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)

Our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous
chapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return
of about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-
tion  of,  say,  4%  annually  resulting  from  reinvested  profits.  (Note
that each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase
the market price by about $1.60.)

The reader will object that in the end our calculations make no
allowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to
result  from  our  projected  3%  annual  inflation.  Our  justification  is
the absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount
in the past has had any direct effect on reported per-share earnings.
The cold figures demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings
of the DJIA unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately
large growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If
inflation  had  operated  as  a  separate  favorable  factor,  its  effect
would  have  been  to  increase  the  “value”  of  previously  existing
capital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old
capital  and  therefore  on  the  old  and  new  capital  combined.  But
nothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during
which  the  wholesale  price  level  has  advanced  nearly  40%.  (Busi-
ness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than
by  “consumer  prices.”)  The  only  way  that  inflation  can  add  to 
common  stock  values  is  by  raising  the  rate  of  earnings  on  cap-
ital  investment.  On  the  basis  of  the  past  record  this  has  not  been 
the case.

In the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-
nied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It
was  generally  felt  that  “a  little  inflation”  was  helpful  to  business
profits. This view is not contradicted by the history of 1950–1970,

* See p. 25.

The Investor and Inflation

which reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and
generally rising prices. But the figures indicate that the effect of all
this on the earning power of common-stock capital (“equity capital”)
has been quite limited; in fact it has not even served to maintain the
rate of earnings on the investment. Clearly there have been impor-
tant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the
real profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the
most important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceed-
ing  the  gains  in  productivity,  and  (2)  the  need  for  huge  amounts 
of  new  capital,  thus  holding  down  the  ratio  of  sales  to  capital
employed.

Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited  our  corporations  and  their  shareholders,  its  effect  has
been quite the opposite. The most striking figures in our table are
those for the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969. It is
surprising how little attention has been paid by economists and by
Wall  Street  to  this  development.  The  debt  of  corporations  has
expanded  nearly  fivefold  while  their  profits  before  taxes  a  little
more than doubled. With the great rise in interest rates during this
period,  it  is  evident  that  the  aggregate  corporate  debt  is  now  an

adverse economic factor of some magnitude and a real problem for
many individual enterprises. (Note that in 1950 net earnings after
interest  but  before  income  tax  were  about  30%  of  corporate  debt,
while  in  1969  they  were  only  13.2%  of  debt.  The  1970  ratio  must
have been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a signifi-
cant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a whole
is accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing
4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the
debt ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have
fallen still lower, in spite of the inflation.

The  stock  market  has  considered  that  the  public-utility  enter-
prises have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a
great advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of
raising  the  rates  charged  under  the  regulatory  process.  But  this
may be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of
electricity, gas, and telephone services have advanced so much less
than  the  general  price  index  puts  these  companies  in  a  strong
strategic position for the future.3 They are entitled by law to charge
rates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital, and
this will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has
in the inflations of the past.

All  of  the  above  brings  us  back  to  our  conclusion  that  the
investor  has  no  sound  basis  for  expecting  more  than  an  average
overall  return  of,  say,  8%  on  a  portfolio  of  DJIA-type  common
stocks  purchased  at  the  late  1971  price  level.  But  even  if  these
expectations  should  prove  to  be  understated  by  a  substantial
amount,  the  case  would  not  be  made  for  an  all-stock  investment
program. If there is one thing guaranteed for the future, it is that
the earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio
will not grow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other figure. In the
memorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, “They will fluctuate.” *
This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s prices—

* John  Pierpont  Morgan  was  the  most  powerful  financier  of  the  late  nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence, he was
constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan developed a
mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will fluctuate.” See Jean
Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (Random House, 1999), p. 11.

or tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory
results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25 years for Gen-
eral Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground lost in the
1929–1932  debacle.  Besides  that,  if  the  investor  concentrates  his
portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either
by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This is particu-
larly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur-
ther inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he will
take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as a
chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a vindica-
tion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying
common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low
the dividend return. That way lies sorrow.

Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust
their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against
the law for American citizens since 1935—luckily for them. In the
past  35  years  the  price  of  gold  in  the  open  market  has  advanced
from  $35  per  ounce  to  $48  in  early  1972—a  rise  of  only  35%.  But
during  all  this  time  the  holder  of  gold  has  received  no  income
return  on  his  capital,  and  instead  has  incurred  some  annual
expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done much better
with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in
the general price level.

The near-complete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the
purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the abil-
ity of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by
putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable

* The  investment  philosopher  Peter  L.  Bernstein  feels  that  Graham  was
“dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at least in the
years  after  Graham  wrote  this  chapter)  has  shown  a  robust  ability  to  out-
pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein agrees, pointing out that a
tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund (say, 2% of your total assets) is too
small  to  hurt  your  overall  returns  when  gold  does  poorly.  But,  when  gold
does well, its returns are often so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100%

objects  have  had  striking  advances  in  market  value  over  the
years—such  as  diamonds,  paintings  by  masters,  first  editions  of
books,  rare  stamps  and  coins,  etc.  But  in  many,  perhaps  most,  of
these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the pre-
carious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is
hard to think of paying $67,500 for a U.S. silver dollar dated 1804
(but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.” 4 We
acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our
readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered
as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount
of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are
also  subject  to  wide  fluctuations;  serious  errors  can  be  made  in
location,  price  paid,  etc.;  there  are  pitfalls  in  salesmen’s  wiles.
Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate
means,  except  by  various  types  of  participations  with  others  and
with the special hazards that attach to new flotations—not too dif-
ferent from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All
we should say to the investor is, “Be sure it’s yours before you go
into it.”

Conclusion

Naturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous
chapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor
cannot  afford  to  put  all  his  funds  into  one  basket—neither  in  the
bond basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds
have recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect
of continuing inflation.

The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income
therefrom,  the  more  necessary  it  is  for  him  to  guard  against  the

in a year—that it can, all by itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter-
ing. However, the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its
high storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund  specializing  in  the  stocks  of  precious-metal  companies  and  charging
below 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total financial
assets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).

unexpected  and  the  disconcerting  in  this  part  of  his  life.  It  is
axiomatic  that  the  conservative  investor  should  seek  to  minimize
his risks. We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a
telephone-company  bond  at  yields  of  nearly  71⁄2%  are  much  less
than  those  involved  in  buying  the  DJIA at  900  (or  any  stock  list
equivalent  thereto).  But  the  possibility  of  large-scale inflation
remains,  and  the  investor  must  carry  some  insurance  against  it.
There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately
against such inflation, but it should carry more protection than the
bond component.

This is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition (p. 97),

and we would write the same today:

It must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common  stocks  at  these  levels  (892  for  the  DJIA).  For  reasons
already given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to
be  without  an  appreciable  proportion  of  common  stocks  in  his
portfolio,  even  if  we  regard  them  as  the  lesser  of  two  evils—the
greater being the risks in an all-bond holding.

Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two

year-old can do it.

Inflation? Who cares about that ?

After all, the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged
less  than  2.2%  between  1997  and  2002—and  economists  believe
(Think,  for
that  even  that  rock-bottom  rate  may  be  overstated.1
instance, of how the prices of computers and home electronics have
plummeted—and  how  the  quality  of  many  goods  has  risen,  meaning
that  consumers  are  getting  better  value  for  their  money.)  In  recent
years, the true rate of inflation in the United States has probably run
around  1%  annually—an  increase  so  infinitesimal  that  many  pundits
have proclaimed that “inflation is dead.” 2

1 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the Consumer Price
Index that measures inflation, maintains a comprehensive and helpful web-
site at www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.
2 For  a  lively  discussion  of  the  “inflation  is  dead”  scenario,  see  www.pbs.
org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html.  In  1996,  the
Boskin  Commission,  a  group  of  economists  asked  by  the  government  to
investigate whether the official rate of inflation is accurate, estimated that it
has been overstated, often by nearly two percentage points per year. For the
commission’s report, see www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html. Many
investment  experts  now  feel  that  deflation,  or  falling  prices,  is  an  even
greater  threat  than  inflation;  the  best  way  to  hedge  against  that  risk  is  by
including bonds as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the com-
mentary on Chapter 4.)

There’s another reason investors overlook the importance of inflation:
what psychologists call the “money illusion.” If you receive a 2% raise
in a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost certainly feel better
than you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a year when inflation is
zero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical
position—2%  worse  off  after  inflation.  So  long  as  the  nominal (or
absolute) change is positive, we view it as a good thing—even if the
real (or after-inflation) result is negative. And any change in your own
salary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices
in the economy as a whole.3 Likewise, investors were delighted to earn
11%  on  bank  certificates  of  deposit  (CDs)  in  1980  and  are  bitterly
disappointed  to  be  earning  only  around  2%  in  2003—even  though
they  were  losing  money  after  inflation  back  then  but  are  keeping  up
with  inflation  now.  The  nominal  rate  we  earn  is  printed  in  the  bank’s
ads  and  posted  in  its  window,  where  a  high  number  makes  us  feel
good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of
taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation
is  so  easy  to  overlook—and  why  it’s  so  important  to  measure  your
investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you
keep after inflation.

More basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard
against whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three
good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:

•

As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one
of the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured
by  the  Consumer  Price  Index,  prices  more  than  doubled  over 
that  period,  rising  at  an  annualized  rate  of  nearly  9%.  In  1979
alone,  inflation  raged  at  13.3%,  paralyzing  the  economy  in  what
became known as “stagflation”—and leading many commentators
to question whether America could compete in the global market-

3 For  more  insights  into  this  behavioral  pitfall,  see  Eldar  Shafir,  Peter  Dia-
mond, and Amos Tversky, “Money Illusion,” in Daniel Kahneman and Amos

place.4 Goods  and  services  priced  at  $100  in  the  beginning  of
1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dol-
lar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff
at such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to
protect against the risk that it might recur.
Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have
suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized
rate  of  25%  or  more.  On  average,  those  inflationary  periods
destroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power.5 We would be
crazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a
disaster.  But  we  would  be  even  crazier  to  conclude  that  it  can
never happen here.6
Rising  prices  allow  Uncle  Sam  to  pay  off  his  debts  with  dollars
that  have  been  cheapened  by  inflation.  Completely  eradicating
inflation  runs  against  the  economic  self-interest  of  any  govern-
ment that regularly borrows money.7

4 That  year,  President  Jimmy  Carter  gave  his  famous  “malaise”  speech,  in
which  he  warned  of  “a  crisis  in  confidence”  that  “strikes  at  the  very  heart
and soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to destroy the social
and the political fabric of America.”

and High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper

6 In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the
American  Revolution,  prices  roughly  tripled  every  year  from  1777  through
1779,  with  a  pound  of  butter  costing  $12  and  a  barrel  of  flour  fetching
nearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-
tion  raged  at  annual  rates  of  29%  (in  the  North)  and  nearly  200%  (in  the
Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.
7 I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,
but  accurate,  insight.  Conversely,  in  a  time  of  deflation  (or  steadily  falling
prices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower—which is why
most investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds,
as a form of insurance against deflating prices.

What, then, can the intelligent investor do to guard against inflation?
The  standard  answer  is  “buy  stocks”—but,  as  common  answers  so
often are, it is not entirely true.

Figure 2-1 shows, for each year from 1926 through 2002, the rela-

tionship between inflation and stock prices.

As you can see, in years when the prices of consumer goods and
services fell, as on the left side of the graph, stock returns were terri-
ble—with the market losing up to 43% of its value.8 When inflation shot
above 6%, as in the years on the right end of the graph, stocks also
stank. The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which
inflation  exceeded  6%;  the  average  return  for  those  14  years  was  a
measly 2.6%.

While mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs
of  their  own  raw  materials  on  to  customers,  high  inflation  wreaks
havoc—forcing  customers  to  slash  their  purchases  and  depressing
activity throughout the economy.

The  historical  evidence  is  clear:  Since  the  advent  of  accurate 
stock-market  data  in  1926,  there  have  been  64  five-year  periods 
(i.e.,  1926–1930,  1927–1931,  1928–1932,  and  so  on  through
1998–2002). In 50 of those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time),
stocks outpaced inflation.9 That’s impressive, but imperfect; it means
that stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.

8 When  inflation  is  negative,  it  is  technically  termed  “deflation.”  Regularly
falling  prices  may  at  first  sound  appealing,  until  you  think  of  the  Japanese
example. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989, with real estate
and  the  stock  market  dropping  in  value  year  after  year—a  relentless  water
torture for the world’s second-largest economy.
9 Ibbotson Associates, Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation, 2003 Handbook
(Ibbotson Associates, Chicago, 2003), Table 2-8. The same pattern is evi-
dent outside the United States: In Belgium, Italy, and Germany, where infla-
tion was especially high in the twentieth century, “inflation appears to have
had a negative impact on both stock and bond markets,” note Elroy Dimson,
Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton in Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of
Global Investment Returns (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 53.

Fortunately, you can bolster your defenses against inflation by branch-
ing out beyond stocks. Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters
have become widely available to investors:

REITs. Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts,  or  REITs  (pronounced
“reets”),  are  companies  that  own  and  collect  rent  from  commercial
and  residential  properties.10 Bundled  into  real-estate  mutual  funds,
REITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van-
guard  REIT  Index  Fund;  other  relatively  low-cost  choices  include
Cohen  &  Steers  Realty  Shares,  Columbia  Real  Estate  Equity  Fund,
and  Fidelity  Real  Estate  Investment  Fund.11 While  a  REIT  fund  is
unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give
you  some  defense  against  the  erosion  of  purchasing  power  without
hampering your overall returns.

TIPS. Treasury  Inflation-Protected  Securities,  or  TIPS,  are  U.S.
government  bonds,  first  issued  in  1997,  that  automatically  go  up  in
value  when  inflation  rises.  Because  the  full  faith  and  credit  of  the
United  States  stands  behind  them,  all  Treasury  bonds  are  safe  from
the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran-
tee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In
one easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the
loss of purchasing power.12

There  is  one  catch,  however.  When  the  value  of  your  TIPS  bond
rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that
increase in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper

10 Thorough, if sometimes outdated, information on REITs can be found at
www.nareit.com.
11 For  further  information,  see  www.vanguard.com,  www.cohenandsteers.
com, www.columbiafunds.com, and www.fidelity.com. The case for investing
in a REIT fund is weaker if you own a home, since that gives you an inherent
stake in real-estate ownership.
12 A good introduction to TIPS can be found at www.publicdebt.treas.gov/

gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does
this make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the
wise  words  of  financial  analyst  Mark  Schweber:  “The  one  question
never to ask a bureaucrat is ‘Why?’ ” Because of this exasperating tax
complication,  TIPS  are  best  suited  for  a  tax-deferred  retirement
account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your
taxable income.

You  can  buy  TIPS  directly  from  the  U.S.  government  at  www.
publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm,  or  in  a  low-cost  mutual  fund  like
Vanguard  Inflation-Protected  Securities  or  Fidelity  Inflation-Protected
Bond Fund.13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal sub-
stitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise
keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run,
so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors,
allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelli-
gent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and entirely
beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

13 For details on these funds, see www.vanguard.com or www.fidelity.com.

CHAPTER 3

A Century of Stock-Market History: 

The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972

The investor’s portfolio of common stocks will represent a small
cross-section of that immense and formidable institution known as
the stock market. Prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea
of stock-market history, in terms particularly of the major fluctua-
tions  in  its  price  level  and  of  the  varying  relationships  between
stock prices as a whole and their earnings and dividends. With this
background  he  may  be  in  a  position  to  form  some  worthwhile
judgment of the attractiveness or dangers of the level of the market
as it presents itself at different times. By a coincidence, useful sta-
tistical  data  on  prices,  earnings,  and  dividends  go  back  just  100
years, to 1871. (The material is not nearly as full or dependable in
the first half-period as in the second, but it will serve.) In this chap-
ter  we  shall  present  the  figures,  in  highly  condensed  form,  with
two  objects  in  view.  The  first  is  to  show  the  general  manner  in
which  stocks  have  made  their  underlying  advance  through  the
many cycles of the past century. The second is to view the picture
in  terms  of  successive  ten-year  averages,  not  only  of  stock  prices
but  of  earnings  and  dividends  as  well,  to  bring  out  the  varying
relationship between the three important factors. With this wealth
of material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the
level of stock prices at the beginning of 1972.

The long-term history of the stock market is summarized in two
tables and a chart. Table 3-1 sets forth the low and high points of
nineteen  bear-  and  bull-market  cycles  in  the  past  100  years.  We
have used two indexes here. The first represents a combination of
an  early  study  by  the  Cowles  Commission  going  back  to  1870,
which  has  been  spliced  on  to  and  continued  to  date  in  the  well-

known Standard & Poor’s composite index of 500 stocks. The sec-
ond is the even more celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (the
DJIA, or “the Dow”), which dates back to 1897; it contains 30 com-
panies, of which one is American Telephone & Telegraph and the
other 29 are large industrial enterprises.1

Chart I, presented by courtesy of Standard & Poor’s, depicts the
market  fluctuations  of  its  425-industrial-stock  index  from  1900
through  1970.  (A corresponding  chart  available  for  the  DJIA will
look very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct
patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs
from  1900  to  1924,  and  shows  for  the  most  part  a  series  of  rather
similar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual
advance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the
“New Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible after-
math  of  collapse,  followed  by  quite  irregular  fluctuations  until
1949.  Comparing  the  average  level  of  1949  with  that  of  1924,  we
find the annual rate of advance to be a mere 11⁄2%; hence the close of
our second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for
common stocks. By the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the
beginning  of  the  greatest  bull  market  in  our  history,  presented  in
the last third of our chart. This phenomenon may have reached its
culmination  in  December  1968  at  118  for  Standard  &  Poor’s  425
industrials  (and  108  for  its  500-stock  composite).  As  Table  3-1
shows, there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968
(especially  in  1956–57  and  1961–62),  but  the  recoveries  therefrom
were  so  rapid  that  they  had  to  be  denominated  (in  the  long-
accepted  semantics)  as  recessions  in  a  single  bull  market,  rather
than  as  separate  market  cycles.  Between  the  low  level  of  162  for
“the  Dow”  in  mid-1949  and  the  high  of  995  in  early  1966,  the
advance  had  been  more  than  sixfold  in  17  years—which  is  at  the
average compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends
of,  say,  31⁄2%  per  annum.  (The  advance  for  the  Standard  &  Poor’s
composite  index  was  somewhat  greater  than  that  of  the  DJIA—
actually from 14 to 96.)

These  14%  and  better  returns  were  documented  in  1963,  and
later, in a much publicized study.* 2 It created a natural satisfaction

on Wall Street with such fine achievements, and a quite illogical and
dangerous  conviction  that  equally  marvelous  results  could  be
expected for common stocks in the future. Few people seem to have
been bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might
indicate that it had been overdone. The subsequent decline from the
1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the Standard & Poor’s com-
posite (and 37% for the DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in
1939–1942,  which  had  reflected  the  perils  and  uncertainties  after
Pearl  Harbor.  In  the  dramatic  manner  so  characteristic  of  Wall
Street, the low level of May 1970 was followed by a massive and
speedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of a new
all-time  high  for  the  Standard  &  Poor’s  industrials  in  early  1972.
The annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out
at about 9% for the S & P composite (or the industrial index), using
the average figures for both years. That rate of climb was, of course,
much greater than for any similar period before 1950. (But in the last
decade  the  rate  of  advance  was  much  lower—51⁄4%  for  the  S  &  P
composite index and only the once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)

The record of price movements should be supplemented by cor-
responding figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide
an overall view of what has happened to our share economy over
the ten decades. We present a conspectus of this kind in our Table
3-2 (p. 71). It is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study
all these figures with care, but for some we hope they will be inter-
esting and instructive.

Let  us  comment  on  them  as  follows:  The  full  decade  figures
smooth  out  the  year-to-year  fluctuations  and  leave  a  general  pic-
ture  of  persistent  growth.  Only  two  of  the  nine  decades  after  the
first show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 1891–1900
and 1931–1940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver-
age  dividends.  But  the  rates  of  growth  in  all  three  categories  are
quite variable. In general the performance since World War II has
been  superior  to  that  of  earlier  decades,  but  the  advance  in  the
1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s. Today’s investor

The Intelligent Investor

cannot tell from this record what percentage gain in earnings divi-
dends and prices he may expect in the next ten years, but it does
supply  all  the  encouragement  he  needs  for  a  consistent  policy  of
common-stock investment.

However, a point should be made here that is not disclosed in
our table. The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in
the overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit
on  invested  capital  fell  to  the  lowest  percentage  since  the  World
War years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number
of companies reported net losses for the year; many became “finan-
cially troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were
quite  a  few  important  bankruptcy  proceedings.  These  facts  as
much  as  any  others  have  prompted  the  statement  made  above*
that the great boom era may have come to an end in 1969–1970.

A striking  feature  of  Table  3-2  is  the  change  in  the  price/earn-
ings ratios since World War II.† In June 1949 the S & P composite
index sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12
months; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi-
dend yield on the S & P index had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to
only  3.0%  in  1961,  a  contrast  heightened  by  the  fact  that  interest
rates  on  high-grade  bonds  had  meanwhile  risen  from  2.60%  to
4.50%.  This  is  certainly  the  most  remarkable  turnabout  in  the
public’s attitude in all stock-market history.

To people  of  long  experience  and  innate  caution  the  passage
from  one  extreme  to  another  carried  a  strong  warning  of  trou-
ble  ahead.  They  could  not  help  thinking  apprehensively  of  the
1926–1929 bull market and its tragic aftermath. But these fears have
not been confirmed by the event. True, the closing price of the DJIA

† The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like the S & P
500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the market’s temperature. If, for
instance, a company earned $1 per share of net income over the past year,
and its stock is selling at $8.93 per share, its price/earnings ratio would be
8.93; if, however, the stock is selling at $69.70, then the price/earnings ratio
would be 69.7. In general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is
considered  low,  between  10  and  20  is  considered  moderate,  and  greater
than 20 is considered expensive. (For more on P/E ratios, see p. 168.)

The Intelligent Investor

in 1970 was the same as it was 61⁄2 years earlier, and the much her-
alded “Soaring Sixties” proved to be mainly a march up a series of
high hills and then down again. But nothing has happened either
to business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar-
ket and depression of 1929–1932.

The Stock-Market Level in Early 1972

With  a  century-long  conspectus  of  stock,  prices,  earnings,  and
dividends  before  our  eyes,  let  us  try  to  draw  some  conclusions
about the level of 900 for the DJIA and 100 for the S & P composite
index in January 1972.

In each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the
stock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the
question  whether  it  was  too  high  for  conservative  purchase.  The
reader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached
on  these  earlier  occasions.  This  is  not  entirely  an  exercise  in  self-
punishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the
various stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also
a taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries
to reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-
els. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959
analyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:

In  1948  we  applied  conservative  standards  to  the  Dow  Jones
level of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that
“it  was  not  too  high  in  relation  to  underlying  values.”  When  we
approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that
year had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked
ourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the
level of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high
for sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular
advance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no
means easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-
tiveness  of  the  1953  level.  We  did  say,  positively  enough,  that
“from  the  standpoint  of  value  indications—our  chief  investment
guide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”
But  we  were  concerned  about  the  fact  that  in  1953,  the  averages
had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the

A Century of Stock-Market History

73

past, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting these
factors  against  our  favorable  value  judgment,  we  advised  a  cau-
tious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-
ularly brilliant counsel. A good prophet would have foreseen that
the  market  level  was  due  to  advance  an  additional  100%  in  the
next five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if
any  of  those  whose  business  was  stock-market  forecasting—as
ours  was  not—had  any  better  inkling  than  we  did  of  what  lay
ahead.

At the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high
of 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be
summarized  in  the  following  (from  page  59  of  the  1959  edition):
“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-
ent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous
because prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the
case  the  market’s  momentum  is  such  as  inevitably  to  carry  it  to
unjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the
future  in  which  there  will  never  be  any  serious  losses,  and  in
which,  every  tyro  will  be  guaranteed  a  large  profit  on  his  stock
purchases.”

The  caution  we  expressed  in  1959  was  somewhat  better  justi-
fied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet
it was far from fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961;
then  fell  a  little  below  our  584  level  (to  566)  later  in  the  year;
advanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic
to 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period
of  six  months.  At  the  same  time  there  was  a  far  more  serious
shrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by
the striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business
Machines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in
June 1962.

This period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched
common  stocks  of  small  enterprises—the  so-called  hot  issues—
which  had  been  offered  to  the  public  at  ridiculously  high  prices
and then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to
levels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the
quotations in just a few months.

The  collapse  in  the  first  half  of  1962  was  disconcerting,  if  not
disastrous,  to  many  self-acknowledged  speculators  and  perhaps 

74

The Intelligent Investor

to  many  more  imprudent  people  who  called  themselves  “in-
vestors.” But the turnabout that came later that year was equally
unsuspected  by  the  financial  community.  The  stock-market  aver-
ages  resumed  their  upward  course,  producing  the  following
sequence:

December 1961

June 1962

November 1964

DJIA

735

536

892

Standard & Poor’s 
500-Stock Composite

72.64

52.32

86.28

The  recovery  and  new  ascent  of  common-stock  prices  was
indeed  remarkable  and  created  a  corresponding  revision  of  Wall
Street  sentiment.  At  the  low  level  of  June  1962  predictions  had
appeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to
the end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.
But at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms
was  again  manifest;  nearly  all  the  forecasts  were  on  the  bullish
side, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.

We then approached the task of appraising the November 1964
levels  of  the  stock  market  (892  for  the  DJIA).  After  discussing 
it  learnedly  from  numerous  angles  we  reached  three  main  con-
clusions.  The  first  was  that  “old  standards  (of  valuation)  appear
inapplicable;  new  standards  have  not  yet  been  tested  by  time.” 
The  second  was  that  the  investor  “must  base  his  policy  on  the 
existence  of  major  uncertainties.  The  possibilities  compass  the
extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in
the market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the
other  hand,  of  a  largely  unheralded  collapse  of  the  same  magni-
tude,  bringing  the  average  in  the  neighborhood  of,  say,  450"" 
(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We
said: “Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how
could  we  say  that  any price  level  is  too  high?”  And  the  chapter
closed as follows:

A Century of Stock-Market History

75

WHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW

Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan-
gerous merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh
our reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from
most competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end
each  one  must  make  his  own  decision  and  accept  responsibility
therefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to
which course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The
principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-
lowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:

1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.
2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.
3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring
it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The
capital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,
and  the  proceeds  invested  in  first-quality  bonds  or  held  as  a
savings deposit.

Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide
dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their
periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel
the market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather
strongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the
late 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina
to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should
appear highly unfavorable.

This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA
advanced  about  11%  further,  to  995,  but  then  fell  irregularly  to  a
low of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of
debacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines
running as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.
And, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture
appeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and
greater  doubts. A single  fact  may  summarize  the  story:  The  DJIA
closed  1970  at  a  level  lower  than  six  years  before—the  first  time
such a thing had happened since 1944.

76

The Intelligent Investor

Such were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is
there anything we and our readers can learn from them? We con-
sidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953
(but too cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584
for DJIA), and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments
could be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-
ful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in
favor  of  a  consistent  and  controlled  common-stock  policy  on  the
one hand, and discouraging endeavors to “beat the market” or to
“pick the winners” on the other.

Nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from
a renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time
as of late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more inter-
esting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.
There is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s Ethics that
goes: “It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of
exactness  which  the  nature  of  the  particular  subject  admits.  It  is
equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a
mathematician  and  to  demand  strict  demonstration  from  an  ora-
tor.” The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle
between that of a mathematician and of an orator.

At various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood
at the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-
ous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to
use the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor’s
composite index (or S & P 500), because it is more comprehensive
and  representative  of  the  general  market  than  the  30-stock  DJIA.
We shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four
dates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,
1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take
the convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times
in 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.
For  our  earnings  figures  we  present  both  the  last  year’s  showing
and the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use
the  last  twelve  months’  figures;  and  for  1971  bond  interest  and
wholesale prices those of August 1971.

The  3-year  price/earnings  ratio  for  the  market  was  lower  in
October 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same
as in 1958, but much higher than in the early years of the long bull

The Intelligent Investor

market. This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-
strued  to  indicate  that  the  market  was  especially  high  in  January
1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought
into the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The
reader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-
ings/price)  to  bond  returns  has  grown  worse  during  the  entire
period, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,
by this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When
dividend  yields  are  compared  with  bond  yields  we  find  that  the
relationship  was  completely  reversed  between  1948  and  1972.  In
the early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds
yield twice as much, and more, than stocks.

Our  final  judgment  is  that  the  adverse  change  in  the  bond-
yield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio
for late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view
of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was
some 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-
point of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the
1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)

In terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still
appear  to  be  one  of  irregular  recovery  from  the  bad  setback  suf-
fered  in  1969–1970.  In  the  past  such  recoveries  have  ushered  in  a
new stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in
1949.  (This  was  the  expectation  of  Wall  Street  generally  during
1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of
low-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too
early (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.
Hence  that  dependable  sign  of  imminent  danger  in  the  market  is
lacking  now,  as  it  was  at  the  892  level  of  the  DJIA in  November
1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-
look would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the
900 DJIA level before the next serious setback or collapse. But we
cannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,
the early-1971-market’s disregard of the harrowing experiences of
less than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness
go unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-
cult  times  ahead—perhaps  in  the  form  of  a  fairly  quick  replay  of
the the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-
market fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3

What Course to Follow

Turn  back  to  what  we  said  in  the  last  edition,  reproduced  on 
p.  75.  This  is  our  view  at  the  same  price  level—say  900—for  the
DJIA in early 1972 as it was in late 1964.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 3

You’ve got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going,
’cause you might not get there.

—Yogi Berra

B U L L - M A R K E T   B A L O N E Y

In  this  chapter,  Graham  shows  how  prophetic  he  can  be.  He  looks 
two  years  ahead,  foreseeing  the  “catastrophic”  bear  market  of
1973–1974,  in  which  U.S.  stocks  lost  37%  of  their  value.1 He  also
looks more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of
market gurus and best-selling books that were not even on the horizon
in his lifetime.

The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortu-
nately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in
the 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance pro-
fessor Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (1994)—culminating,
in a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett’s Dow
36,000, David  Elias’  Dow  40,000, and  Charles  Kadlec’s  Dow
100,000 (all published in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had
returned  an  annual  average  of  7%  after  inflation  ever  since  1802.
Therefore, they concluded, that’s what investors should expect in the
future.

Some bulls went further. Since stocks had “always” beaten bonds
over  any  period  of  at  least  30  years,  stocks  must  be  less  risky  than
bonds or even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of
owning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why

quibble over how much you pay for them in the first place? (To find out
why, see the sidebar on p. 82.)

In 1999 and early 2000, bull-market baloney was everywhere:

• On  December  7,  1999,  Kevin  Landis,  portfolio  manager  of  the
Firsthand mutual funds, appeared on CNN’s Moneyline telecast.
Asked  if  wireless  telecommunication  stocks  were  overvalued—
with  many  trading  at  infinite  multiples  of  their  earnings—Landis
had a ready answer. “It’s not a mania,” he shot back. “Look at the
outright growth, the absolute value of the growth. It’s big.”

• On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist
at the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal: “It’s a
new world order. We see people discard all the right companies
with all the right people with the right vision because their stock
price is too high—that’s the worst mistake an investor can make.”
In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Apple-
gate,  then  the  chief  investment  strategist  at  Lehman  Brothers,
asked  rhetorically:  “Is  the  stock  market  riskier  today  than  two
years ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.”

•

But the answer is yes. It always has been. It always will be.
And  when  Graham  asked,  “Can  such  heedlessness  go  unpun-
ished?” he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no. Like an
enraged  Greek  god,  the  stock  market  crushed  everyone  who  had
come  to  believe  that  the  high  returns  of  the  late  1990s  were  some
kind  of  divine  right.  Just  look  at  how  those  forecasts  by  Landis,
Froelich, and Applegate held up:

•

•

•

From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis’s pet wire-
less  stocks,  Nokia,  lost  “only”  67%—while  the  worst,  Winstar
Communications, lost 99.9%.
Froelich’s favorite stocks—Cisco Systems and Motorola—fell more
than 70% by late 2002. Investors lost over $400 billion on Cisco
alone—more  than  the  annual  economic  output  of  Hong  Kong,
Israel, Kuwait, and Singapore combined.
In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the
Dow Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite
Index was at 4446. By the end of 2002, the Dow was hobbling
around the 8,300 level, while NASDAQ had withered to roughly
1300—eradicating all its gains over the previous six years.

S U R V I V A L   O F   T H E   F A T T E S T

There was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have “always”
beaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do
not exist. The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market’s
earliest  returns  contain  as  few  as  seven  (yes,  7!)  stocks.1 By
1800,  however,  there  were  some  300  companies  in  America
(many  in  the  Jeffersonian  equivalents  of  the  Internet:  wooden
turnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and their investors
lost their knickers.

But  the  stock  indexes  ignore  all  the  companies  that  went
bust in those early years, a problem technically known as “sur-
vivorship  bias.”  Thus  these  indexes  wildly  overstate  the  results
earned  by  real-life  investors—who  lacked  the  20/20  hindsight
necessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy. A lonely
handful of companies, including Bank of New York and J. P. Mor-
gan Chase, have prospered continuously since the 1790s. But
for  every  such  miraculous  survivor,  there  were  thousands  of
financial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Penn-
sylvania Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers’s Gap Turn-
pike Co.—all omitted from the “historical” stock indexes.

Jeremy  Siegel’s  data  show  that,  after  inflation,  from  1802
through  1870  stocks  gained  7.0%  per  year,  bonds  4.8%,  and
cash  5.1%.  But  Elroy  Dimson  and  his  colleagues  at  London
Business  School  estimate  that  the  pre-1871  stock  returns  are
overstated  by  at  least  two  percentage  points  per  year.2 In  the
real world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds—and
perhaps  a  bit  worse.  Anyone  who  claims  that  the  long-term
record  “proves”  that  stocks  are  guaranteed  to  outperform
bonds or cash is an ignoramus.

1 By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan-

cial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the

rambunctious young American stock market.
2 See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time, May 6, 2002,
p. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between 1871 and

the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds of automobile,

aviation, and radio companies that went bust without a trace. These returns,

too, are probably overstated by one to two percentage points.

As the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham
urges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.
Why should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their
past  returns?  When  every  investor  comes  to  believe  that  stocks  are
guaranteed to make money in the long run, won’t the market end up
being  wildly  overpriced?  And  once  that  happens,  how  can  future
returns possibly be high?

Graham’s  answers,  as  always,  are  rooted  in  logic  and  common
sense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function
of the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering
away,  corporate  profits  appeared  to  be  booming,  and  most  of  the
world was at peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean—
that stocks were worth buying at any price. Since the profits that com-
panies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to
pay for stocks must also be finite.

Think of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the great-
est basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Sta-
dium like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by
paying  Jordan  up  to  $34  million  a  year  to  bounce  a  big  leather  ball
around a wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have
been justified paying him $340 million, or $3.4 billion, or $34 billion,
per season.

T H E L I M I T S   O F   O P T I M I S M

Focusing  on  the  market’s  recent  returns  when  they  have  been  rosy,
warns Graham, will lead to “a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion
that equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks
in the future.” From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least
20%  each  year—a  surge  unprecedented  in  American  history—stock
buyers became ever more optimistic:

•

In  mid-1998,  investors  surveyed  by  the  Gallup  Organization  for
the PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn
an average of roughly 13% over the year to come. By early 2000,
their average expected return had jumped to more than 18%.

84

•

Commentary on Chapter 3

“Sophisticated professionals” were just as bullish, jacking up their
own  assumptions  of  future  returns.  In  2001,  for  instance,  SBC
Communications raised the projected return on its pension plan
from 8.5% to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return
on the pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-
stock index had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.

A quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:

• Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of
one-year  returns  on  stocks  had  slumped  to  7%—even  though
investors  could  now  buy  at  prices  nearly  50%  lower  than  in
2000.2
Those  gung-ho  assumptions  about  the  returns  on  their  pension
plans will cost the companies in the S & P 500 a bare minimum of
$32  billion  between  2002  and  2004,  according  to  recent  Wall
Street estimates.

•

Even  though  investors  all  know  they’re  supposed  to  buy  low  and
sell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s
warning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more
enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,
the  more  certain  they  are  to  be  proved  wrong  in  the  short  run.  On
March  24,  2000,  the  total  value  of  the  U.S.  stock  market  peaked  at
$14.75  trillion.  By  October  9,  2002,  just  30  months  later,  the  total
U.S.  stock  market  was  worth  $7.34  trillion,  or  50.2%  less—a  loss  of
$7.41  trillion.  Meanwhile,  many  market  pundits  turned  sourly  bear-
ish,  predicting  flat  or  even  negative  market  returns  for  years—even
decades—to come.

At this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering
how calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed
on  something,  why  on  earth  should  the  intelligent  investor  believe
them now?

2 Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’ expec-
tation of a 7% stock return will be realized.

Instead, let’s tune out the noise and think about future returns as Gra-
ham might. The stock market’s performance depends on three factors:

•
•

•

real growth (the rise of companies’ earnings and dividends)
inflationary  growth  (the  general  rise  of  prices  throughout  the
economy)
speculative  growth—or  decline  (any  increase  or  decrease  in  the
investing public’s appetite for stocks)

In the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share
has averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).3 As of early 2003,
inflation  was  running  around  2.4%  annually;  the  dividend  yield  on
stocks was 1.9%. So,

1.5% to 2%

+ 2.4%
+ 1.9%
= 5.8% to 6.3%

In  the  long  run,  that  means  you  can  reasonably  expect  stocks  to
average  roughly  a  6%  return  (or  4%  after  inflation).  If  the  investing
public gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that
speculative  fever  will  temporarily  drive  returns  higher.  If,  instead,
investors  are  full  of  fear,  as  they  were  in  the  1930s  and  1970s,  the
returns  on  stocks  will  go  temporarily  lower.  (That’s  where  we  are  in
2003.)

Robert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham
inspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of
the  Standard  &  Poor’s  500-stock  index  against  average  corporate
profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the histori-
cal record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20,
the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well

ing paper, July, 2002.

below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road. In
early 2003, by Shiller’s math, stocks were priced at about 22.8 times
the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decade—still in the
danger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times
earnings in December 1999.

How has the market done in the past when it was priced around
today’s  levels?  Figure  3-1  shows  the  previous  periods  when  stocks
were at similar highs, and how they fared over the 10-year stretches
that followed:

So, from valuation levels similar to those of early 2003, the stock
market has sometimes done very well in the ensuing 10 years, some-
times poorly, and muddled along the rest of the time. I think Graham,
ever the conservative, would split the difference between the lowest
and highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks
will earn roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that
projection  matches  the  estimate  we  got  earlier  when  we  added
together  real  growth,  inflationary  growth,  and  speculative  growth.)
Compared to the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it’s a whisker better
than the gains that bonds are likely to produce—and reason enough for
most investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.

But there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing
you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that
you will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that
the past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always!
And the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will
most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their
views about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecast-
ing powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a
view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.

So, by all means, you should lower your expectations—but take care
not  to  depress  your  spirit.  For  the  intelligent  investor,  hope  always
springs eternal, because it should. In the financial markets, the worse
the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be. A cynic once told
G. K. Chesterton, the British novelist and essayist, “Blessed is he who
expecteth  nothing,  for  he  shall  not  be  disappointed.”  Chesterton’s
rejoinder?  “Blessed  is  he  who  expecteth  nothing,  for  he  shall  enjoy
everything.”

CHAPTER 4

General Portfolio Policy: 

The Defensive Investor

The  basic  characteristics  of  an  investment  portfolio  are  usually
determined  by  the  position  and  characteristics  of  the  owner  or
owners. At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance
companies, and so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago their
investments  were  limited  by  law  in  many  states  to  high-grade
bonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other
extreme  we  have  the  well-to-do  and  experienced  businessman,
who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-
vided he considers it an attractive purchase.

It  has  been  an  old  and  sound  principle  that  those  who  cannot
afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return
on their invested funds. From this there has developed the general
notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is
more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.
Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-
dent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-
ing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes
to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from
concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and
enterprising  investor  who  exercises  maximum  intelligence  and
skill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be less real risk
associated  with  buying  a  ‘bargain  issue’  offering  the  chance  of  a
large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about
41⁄2%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-
pected,  since  in  subsequent  years  even  the  best  long-term  bonds
lost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in
interest rates.

The Basic Problem of Bond-Stock Allocation

We have already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of
the defensive investor.* He should divide his funds between high-
grade bonds and high-grade common stocks.

We have  suggested  as  a  fundamental  guiding  rule  that  the
investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his
funds  in  common  stocks,  with  a  consequent  inverse  range  of
between 75% and 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that
the  standard  division  should  be  an  equal  one,  or  50–50,  between
the  two  major  investment  mediums.  According  to  tradition  the
sound  reason  for  increasing  the  percentage  in  common  stocks
would be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a
protracted  bear  market.  Conversely,  sound  procedure  would  call
for  reducing  the  common-stock  component  below  50%  when  in 
the judgment of the investor the market level has become danger-
ously high.

These  copybook  maxims  have  always  been  easy  to  enunciate
and always difficult to follow—because they go against that very
human nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear mar-
kets.  It  is  almost  a  contradiction  in  terms  to  suggest  as  a  feasible
policy for the average stockowner that he lighten his holdings when
the market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after
a  corresponding  decline.  It  is  because  the  average  man  operates,
and apparently must operate, in opposite fashion that we have had
the  great  advances  and  collapses  of  the  past;  and—this  writer
believes—we are likely to have them in the future.

If  the  division  between  investment  and  speculative  operations
were  as  clear  now  as  once  it  was,  we  might  be  able  to  envisage
investors as a shrewd, experienced group who sell out to the heed-
less, hapless speculators at high prices and buy back from them at
depressed levels. This picture may have had some verisimilitude in
bygone  days,  but  it  is  hard  to  identify  it  with  financial  develop-
ments  since  1949.  There  is  no  indication  that  such  professional
operations  as  those  of  the  mutual  funds  have  been  conducted  in
this fashion. The percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the

* See Graham’s “Conclusion” to Chapter 2, p. 56–57.

90

The Intelligent Investor

two major types of funds—“balanced” and “common-stock”—has
changed very little from year to year. Their selling activities have
been  largely  related  to  endeavors  to  switch  from  less  to  more
promising holdings.

If,  as  we  have  long  believed,  the  stock  market  has  lost  contact
with its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established,
then we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce
his common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild
them later to the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the
investor should not have more than one-half in equities unless he
has strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is
sure that he could view a market decline of the 1969–70 type with
equanimity. It is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can
be  justified  at  the  levels  existing  in  early  1972.  Thus  we  would
counsel  against  a  greater  than  50%  apportionment  to  common
stocks  at  this  time.  But,  for  complementary  reasons,  it  is  almost
equally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%,
unless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current
market level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in
any further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.

We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may
appear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the
guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi-
sion between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the mar-
ket  level  have  raised  the  common-stock  component  to,  say,  55%,
the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock
portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a
fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use
of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.

Yale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number
of years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% “normal hold-
ing” in common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to
have given up its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its
portfolio  in  equities  (including  some  convertibles).  (At  that  time
the endowment funds of 71 such institutions, totaling $7.6 billion,
held  60.3%  in  common  stocks.)  The  Yale  example  illustrates  the
almost lethal effect of the great market advance upon the once pop-
ular formula approach to investment. Nonetheless we are convinced
that our 50–50 version of this approach makes good sense for the

General Portfolio Policy

91

defensive investor. It is extremely simple; it aims unquestionably in
the right direction; it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least
making  some  moves  in  response  to  market  developments;  most
important  of  all,  it  will  restrain  him  from  being  drawn  more  and
more heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and
more dangerous heights.

Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with
the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a
severe  decline  he  may  derive  much  solace  from  reflecting  how
much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.

While our proposed 50–50 division is undoubtedly the simplest
“all-purpose program” devisable, it may not turn out to be the best
in terms of results achieved. (Of course, no approach, mechanical
or otherwise, can be advanced with any assurance that it will work
out  better  than  another.)  The  much  larger  income  return  now
offered  by  good  bonds  than  by  representative  stocks  is  a  potent
argument for favoring the bond component. The investor’s choice
between 50% or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on
his own temperament and attitude. If he can act as a cold-blooded
weigher of the odds, he would be likely to favor the low 25% stock
component at this time, with the idea of waiting until the DJIA div-
idend yield was, say, two-thirds of the bond yield before he would
establish  his  median  50–50  division  between  bonds  and  stocks.
Starting  from  900  for  the  DJIA and  dividends  of  $36  on  the  unit,
this would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 71⁄2% to
about  5.5%  without  any  change  in  the  present  return  on  leading
stocks, or a fall in the DJIA to as low as 660 if there is no reduction
in  bond  yields  and  no  increase  in  dividends.  A combination  of
intermediate  changes  could  produce  the  same  “buying  point.” A
program of that kind is not especially complicated; the hard part is
to  adopt  it  and  to  stick  to  it  not  to  mention  the  possibility  that  it
may turn out to have been much too conservative.

The Bond Component

The  choice  of  issues  in  the  bond  component  of  the  investor’s
portfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy tax-
able or tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-term
maturities?  The  tax  decision  should  be  mainly  a  matter  of  arith-

92

The Intelligent Investor

metic,  turning  on  the  difference  in  yields  as  compared  with  the
investor’s tax bracket. In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturi-
ties  was  between  obtaining,  say,  71⁄2%  on  “grade  Aa”  corporate
bonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term “municipals” is
generally  applied  to  all  species  of  tax-exempt  bonds,  including
state obligations.) There was thus for this maturity a loss in income
of some 30% in passing from the corporate to the municipal field.
Hence  if  the  investor  was  in  a  maximum  tax  bracket  higher  than
30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic-
ipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A
single  person  starts  paying  a  30%  rate  when  his  income  after
deductions  passes  $10,000;  for  a  married  couple  the  rate  applies
when combined taxable income passes $20,000. It is evident that a
large  proportion  of  individual  investors  would  obtain  a  higher
return after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate
bonds.

The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a
different  question,  viz.:  Does  the  investor  want  to  assure  himself
against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a
lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable
gain in principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in
Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.

For  a  period  of  many  years  in  the  past  the  only  sensible  bond
purchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety
was—and is—unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other
bond  investments  of  first  quality;  they  had  a  money-back  option
and other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In
our earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled “U.S. Savings
Bonds: A Boon to Investors.”

As  we  shall  point  out,  U.S.  savings  bonds  still  possess  certain
unique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ-
ual  investor.  For  the  man  of  modest  capital—with,  say,  not  more
than $10,000 to put into bonds—we think they are still the easiest
and  the  best  choice.  But  those  with  larger  funds  may  find  other
mediums more desirable.

Let us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con-
sideration,  and  discuss  them  briefly  with  respect  to  general
description, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and
other features.

General Portfolio Policy

1. u.s. savings bonds, series e and series h. We shall first sum-
marize  their  important  provisions,  and  then  discuss  briefly  the
numerous advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly
convenient  investments.  The  Series  H  bonds  pay  interest  semi-
annually, as do other bonds. The rate is 4.29% for the first year, and
then a flat 5.10% for the next nine years to maturity. Interest on the
Series  E  bonds  is  not  paid  out,  but  accrues  to  the  holder  through
increase  in  redemption  value.  The  bonds  are  sold  at  75%  of  their
face value, and mature at 100% in 5 years 10 months after purchase.
If held to maturity the yield works out at 5%, compounded semi-
annually. If redeemed earlier, the yield moves up from a minimum
of 4.01% in the first year to an average of 5.20% in the next 45⁄6 years.
Interest  on  the  bonds  is  subject  to  Federal  income  tax,  but  is
exempt from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the
Series E bonds may be paid at the holder’s option either annually
as  the  interest  accrues  (through  higher  redemption  value),  or  not
until the bond is actually disposed of.

Owners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly
after purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series
H  bonds  have  similar  rights  to  cash  them  in  at  par  value  (cost).
Series  E  bonds  are  exchangeable  for  Series  H  bonds,  with  certain
tax  advantages.  Bonds  lost,  destroyed,  or  stolen  may  be  replaced
without cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but liberal
provisions  for  co-ownership  by  family  members  make  it  possible
for  most  investors  to  buy  as  many  as  they  can  afford.  Comment:
There is no other investment that combines (1) absolute assurance
of  principal  and  interest  payments,  (2)  the  right  to  demand  full
“money back” at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5% inter-
est rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of Series
E bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and
thus  to  continue  to  accumulate  annual  values  at  successively
higher rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long
periods  has  been  of  great  dollar  advantage;  we  calculate  it  has
increased the effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a
third in typical cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at
cost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low
interest  rates  complete  protection  against  the  shrinkage  in  princi-
pal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave
them  the  possibility  of  benefiting from  the  rise  in  interest  rates  by

94

The Intelligent Investor

switching their low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues
on an even-money basis.

In  our  view  the  special  advantages  enjoyed  by  owners  of  sav-
ings bonds now will more than compensate for their lower current
return as compared with other direct government obligations.

2. other united states bonds. A profusion of these issues exists,
covering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates. All of
them are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and
principal.  They  are  subject  to  Federal  income  taxes  but  free  from
state income tax. In late 1971 the long-term issues—over ten years—
showed an average yield of 6.09%, intermediate issues (three to five
years) returned 6.35%, and short issues returned 6.03%.

In 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large dis-
counts.  Some  of  these  are  accepted  at  par  in  settlement  of  estate
taxes. Example: The U.S. Treasury 31⁄2s due 1990 are in this category;
they sold at 60 in 1970, but closed 1970 above 77.

It is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect obli-
gations  of  the  U.S.  government  yield  appreciably  more  than  its
direct  obligations  of  the  same  maturity.  As  we  write,  an  offering
appears of 7.05% of “Certificates Fully Guaranteed by the Secretary
of  Transportation  of  the  Department  of  Transportation  of  the
United  States.”  The  yield  was  fully  1%  more  than  that  on  direct
obligations of the U.S., maturing the same year (1986). The certifi-
cates were actually issued in the name of the Trustees of the Penn
Central  Transportation  Co.,  but  they  were  sold  on  the  basis  of  a
statement by the U.S. Attorney General that the guarantee “brings
into being a general obligation of the United States, backed by its
full faith and credit.” Quite a number of indirect obligations of this
sort have been assumed by the U.S. government in the past, and all
of them have been scrupulously honored.

The reader may wonder why all this hocus-pocus, involving an
apparently  “personal  guarantee”  by  our  Secretary  of  Transporta-
tion, and a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end. The chief reason
for  the  indirection  has  been  the  debt  limit  imposed  on  govern-
ment  borrowing  by  the  Congress.  Apparently  guarantees  by  the
government  are  not  regarded  as  debts—a  semantic  windfall  for
shrewder investors. Perhaps the chief impact of this situation has
been  the  creation  of  tax-free  Housing  Authority  bonds,  enjoying

General Portfolio Policy

95

the  equivalent  of  a  U.S.  guarantee,  and  virtually  the  only  tax-
exempt  issues  that  are  equivalent  to  government  bonds. Another
type  of  government-backed  issues  is  the  recently  created  New
Community Debentures, offered to yield 7.60% in September 1971.

3. state  and  municipal  bonds. These  enjoy  exemption  from
Federal income tax. They are also ordinarily free of income tax in
the state of issue but not elsewhere. They are either direct obliga-
tions of a state or subdivision, or “revenue bonds” dependent for
interest  payments  on  receipts  from  a  toll  road,  bridge,  building
lease, etc. Not all tax-free bonds are strongly enough protected to
justify their purchase by a defensive investor. He may be guided in
his selection by the rating given to each issue by Moody’s or Stan-
dard & Poor’s. One of three highest ratings by both services—Aaa
(AAA), Aa (AA), or A—should constitute a sufficient indication of
adequate safety. The yield on these bonds will vary both with the
quality  and  the  maturity,  with  the  shorter  maturities  giving  the
lower  return.  In  late  1971  the  issues  represented  in  Standard  &
Poor’s  municipal  bond  index  averaged  AA in  quality  rating,  20
years  in  maturity,  and  5.78%  in  yield.  A typical  offering  of
Vineland, N.J., bonds, rated AA for A and gave a yield of only 3%
on the one-year maturity, rising to 5.8% to the 1995 and 1996 matu-
rities.1

4. corporation bonds. These bonds are subject to both Federal
and state tax. In early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 7.19%
for  a  25-year  maturity,  as  reflected  in  the  published  yield  of
Moody’s Aaa corporate bond index. The so-called lower-medium-
grade  issues—rated  Baa—returned  8.23%  for  long  maturities.  In
each  class  shorter-term  issues  would  yield  somewhat  less  than
longer-term obligations.

Comment. The  above  summaries  indicate  that  the  average
investor  has  several  choices  among  high-grade  bonds.  Those  in
high income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield
from  good  tax-free  issues  than  from  taxable  ones.  For  others  the
early 1972 range of taxable yield would seem to be from 5.00% on
U.S.  savings  bonds,  with  their  special  options,  to  about  71⁄2%  on
high-grade corporate issues.

96

The Intelligent Investor

Higher-Yielding Bond Investments

By  sacrificing  quality  an  investor  can  obtain  a  higher  income
return from his bonds. Long experience has demonstrated that the
ordinary  investor  is  wiser  to  keep  away  from  such  high-yield
bonds. While, taken as a whole, they may work out somewhat bet-
ter  in  terms  of  overall  return  than  the  first-quality  issues,  they
expose the owner to too many individual risks of untoward devel-
opments, ranging from disquieting price declines to actual default.
(It  is  true  that  bargain  opportunities  occur  fairly  often  in  lower-
grade  bonds,  but  these  require  special  study  and  skill  to  exploit
successfully.)*

Perhaps  we  should  add  here  that  the  limits  imposed  by  Con-
gress on direct bond issues of the United States have produced at
least two sorts of “bargain opportunities” for investors in the pur-
chase  of  government-backed  obligations.  One  is  provided  by  the
tax-exempt  “New  Housing”  issues,  and  the  other  by  the  recently
created  (taxable)  “New  Community  debentures.”  An  offering  of
New Housing issues in July 1971 yielded as high as 5.8%, free from
both Federal and state taxes, while an issue of (taxable) New Com-
munity  debentures  sold  in  September  1971  yielded  7.60%.  Both
obligations  have  the  “full  faith  and  credit”  of  the  United  States
government  behind  them  and  hence  are  safe  without  question.
And—on a net basis—they yield considerably more than ordinary
United States bonds.†

* Graham’s  objection  to  high-yield  bonds  is  mitigated  today  by  the  wide-
spread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the research
of owning “junk bonds.” See the commentary on Chapter 6 for more detail.
† The  “New  Housing”  bonds  and  “New  Community  debentures”  are  no
more. New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income
tax, but they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures,
also  backed  by  HUD,  were  authorized  by  a  Federal  law  passed  in  1968.
About $350 million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the
program was terminated in 1983.

Savings Deposits in Lieu of Bonds

An  investor  may  now  obtain  as  high  an  interest  rate  from  a 
savings deposit in a commercial or savings bank (or from a bank
certificate  of  deposit)  as  he  can  from  a  first-grade  bond  of  short
maturity. The interest rate on bank savings accounts may be low-
ered in the future, but under present conditions they are a suitable
substitute for short-term bond investment by the individual.

Convertible Issues

These are discussed in Chapter 16. The price variability of bonds
in general is treated in Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctu-
ations.

Call Provisions

In  previous  editions  we  had  a  fairly  long  discussion  of  this
aspect  of  bond  financing,  because  it  involved  a  serious  but  little
noticed  injustice  to  the  investor.  In  the  typical  case  bonds  were
callable  fairly  soon  after  issuance,  and  at  modest  premiums—say
5%—above the issue price. This meant that during a period of wide
fluctuations  in  the  underlying  interest  rates  the  investor  had  to
bear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all
but a meager participation in favorable ones.

Example: Our standard example has been the issue of American
Gas & Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101 in
1928.  Four  years  later,  under  near-panic  conditions,  the  price  of
these good bonds fell to 621⁄2, yielding 8%. By 1946, in a great rever-
sal, bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3%, and the 5%
issue should have been quoted at close to 160. But at that point the
company  took  advantage  of  the  call  provision  and  redeemed  the
issue at a mere 106.

The call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised
instance  of  “heads  I  win,  tails  you  lose.”  At  long  last,  the  bond-
buying  institutions  refused  to  accept  this  unfair  arrangement;  in
recent  years  most  long-term  high-coupon  issues  have  been  pro-
tected against redemption for ten years or more after issuance. This
still limits their possible price rise, but not inequitably.

98

The Intelligent Investor

In practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to
sacrifice  a  small  amount  of  yield  to  obtain  the  assurance  of  non-
callability—say for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage
in  buying  a  low-coupon  bond*  at  a  discount  rather  than  a  high-
coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For
the discount—e.g., of a 31⁄2% bond at 631⁄2%, yielding 7.85%—carries
full protection against adverse call action.

Straight—i.e., Nonconvertible—Preferred Stocks

Certain general observations should be made here on the subject
of preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,
but  they  are  good  in  spite  of  their  investment  form,  which  is  an
inherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent
for his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-
dends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-
ted,  or  even  in  danger,  his  own  position  becomes  precarious,  for
the directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless
they also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-
ferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the
fixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal
claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of
a common shareholder (or partner).

These weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend
to  come  to  the  fore  recurrently  in  periods  of  depression.  Only  a
small percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched
as to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-
situdes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is
when their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At
such times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but
too unconventional for the defensive investor.)

In other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not
at  all.  We  shall  refer  later  to  convertible  and  similarly  privileged
issues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are
not ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.

Another  peculiarity  in  the  general  position  of  preferred  stocks

* A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays a rate of
interest income below the market average.

General Portfolio Policy

99

deserves mention. They have a much better tax status for corpora-
tion buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income
tax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the
full amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-
rate  rate  is  48%,  this  means  that  $100  received  as  preferred-stock
dividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-
est  is  taxed  $48.  On  the  other  hand,  individual  investors  pay
exactly  the  same  tax  on  preferred-stock  investments  as  on  bond
interest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,
all investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-
rations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors
who pay income tax.*

Security Forms

The  bond  form  and  the  preferred-stock  form,  as  hitherto  dis-
cussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. A bond-
holder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal
on  a  definite  date.  The  owner  of  a  preferred  stock  is  entitled  to  a
fixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-
mon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-
ified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He
may or may not have a vote.)

The above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the
majority  of  bond  and  preferred  issues,  but  there  are  innumerable
departures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible
and  similar  issues,  and  income  bonds.  In  the  latter  type,  interest
does  not  have  to  be  paid  unless  it  is  earned  by  the  company.
(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-
ings, but the period is often limited to three years.)

Income  bonds  should  be  used  by  corporations  much  more

* While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed. Corpora-
tions can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from dividends,
and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a corporation would pay
roughly  $24.50  in  tax  on  $100  in  dividends  from  preferred  stock  versus
$35  in  tax  on  $100  in  interest  income.  Individuals  pay  the  same  rate  of
income tax on dividend income that they do on interest income, so preferred
stock offers them no tax advantage.

extensively than they are. Their avoidance apparently arises from a
mere  accident  of  economic  history—namely,  that  they  were  first
employed in quantity in connection with railroad reorganizations,
and hence they have been associated from the start with financial
weakness and poor investment status. But the form itself has sev-
eral  practical  advantages,  especially  in  comparison  with  and  in
substitution for the numerous (convertible) preferred-stock issues
of  recent  years.  Chief  of  these  is  the  deductibility  of  the  interest
paid from the company’s taxable income, which in effect cuts the
cost of that form of capital in half. From the investor’s standpoint it
is probably best for him in most cases that he should have (1) an
unconditional  right  to  receive  interest  payments  when  they  are
earned by the company, and (2) a right to other forms of protection
than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid. The
terms  of  income  bonds  can  be  tailored  to  the  advantage  of  both 
the  borrower  and  the  lender  in  the  manner  best  suited  to  both.
(Conversion privileges can, of course, be included.) The acceptance
by  everybody  of  the  inherently  weak  preferred-stock  form  and 
the  rejection  of  the  stronger  income-bond  form  is  a  fascinating
illustration of the way in which traditional institutions and habits
often tend to persist on Wall Street despite new conditions calling
for  a  fresh  point  of  view.  With  every  new  wave  of  optimism  or 
pessimism, we are ready to abandon history and time-tested prin-
ciples, but we cling tenaciously and unquestioningly to our preju-
dices.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 4

When you leave it to chance, then all of a sudden you don’t
have any more luck.

—Basketball coach Pat Riley

How aggressive should your portfolio be?

That, says Graham, depends less on what kinds of investments you
own than on what kind of investor you are. There are two ways to be
an intelligent investor:

•

•

by  continually  researching,  selecting,  and  monitoring  a  dynamic
mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;
or  by  creating  a  permanent  portfolio  that  runs  on  autopilot  and
requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).

Graham calls the first approach “active” or “enterprising”; it takes
lots of time and loads of energy. The “passive” or “defensive” strategy
takes  little  time  or  effort  but  requires  an  almost  ascetic  detachment
from  the  alluring  hullabaloo  of  the  market.  As  the  investment  thinker
Charles  Ellis  has  explained,  the  enterprising  approach  is  physically
and  intellectually  taxing,  while  the  defensive  approach  is  emotionally
demanding.1

If you have time to spare, are highly competitive, think like a sports
fan,  and  relish  a  complicated  intellectual  challenge,  then  the  active

1 For more about the distinction between physically and intellectually difficult
investing on the one hand, and emotionally difficult investing on the other,
see  Chapter  8  and  also  Charles  D.  Ellis,  “Three  Ways  to  Succeed  as  an
Investor,” in Charles D. Ellis and James R. Vertin, eds., The Investor’s Anthol-
ogy (John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 72.

approach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave simplicity,
and don’t relish thinking about money, then the passive approach is for
you. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-
ods—creating  a  portfolio  that  is  mainly  active  and  partly  passive,  or
vice versa.)

Both approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful
with either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right
one, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep
your costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction between
active and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in our
investments—but also within ourselves.

C A N   Y O U   B E   B R A V E ,   O R   W I L L   Y O U   C A V E ?

How, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most
basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in
bonds  and  cash.  (Note  that  Graham  deliberately  places  this  discus-
sion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge
that inflation is one of your worst enemies.)

The most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allo-
cate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions
the word “age.” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-
ventional wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you ought
to take depends mainly on how old you are.2 A traditional rule of thumb
was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your
assets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old would
put 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%
there.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the
late 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were younger
than 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had
only a “moderate” tolerance for risk! 3

2 A recent Google search for the phrase “age and asset allocation” turned
up more than 30,000 online references.

for  Profiting  from  the  Coming  Rise  in  the  Stock  Market (Times Business,
1999), p. 250.

103

Unless  you’ve  allowed  the  proponents  of  this  advice  to  subtract
100 from your IQ, you should be able to tell that something is wrong
here. Why should your age determine how much risk you can take?
An  89-year-old  with  $3  million,  an  ample  pension,  and  a  gaggle  of
grandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds.
She  already  has  plenty  of  income,  and  her  grandchildren  (who  will
eventually  inherit  her  stocks)  have  decades  of  investing  ahead  of
them. On the other hand, a 25-year-old who is saving for his wedding
and  a  house  down  payment  would  be  out  of  his  mind  to  put  all  his
money in stocks. If the stock market takes an Acapulco high dive, he
will have no bond income to cover his downside—or his backside.

What’s  more,  no  matter  how  young  you  are,  you  might  suddenly
need to yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now, but 40
minutes from now. Without a whiff of warning, you could lose your job,
get divorced, become disabled, or suffer who knows what other kind
of surprise. The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone
must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.

Finally,  many  people  stop  investing  precisely  because the  stock
market  goes  down.  Psychologists  have  shown  that  most  of  us  do  a
very poor job of predicting today how we will feel about an emotionally
charged event in the future.4 When stocks are going up 15% or 20%
a year, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, it’s easy to imagine that
you  and  your  stocks  are  married  for  life.  But  when  you  watch  every
dollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime, it’s hard to resist
bailing out into the “safety” of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and
holding their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, and
holding  nothing  but  their  own  head  in  their  hands.  Because  so  few
investors have the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market, Graham
insists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. That
cushion, he argues, will give you the courage to keep the rest of your
money in stocks even when stocks stink.

To get a better feel for how much risk you can take, think about the
fundamental  circumstances  of  your  life,  when  they  will  kick  in,  when
they might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for cash:

Are you single or married? What does your spouse or partner do
for a living?
Do  you  or  will  you  have  children?  When  will  the  tuition  bills  hit
home?

• Will you inherit money, or will you end up financially responsible

for aging, ailing parents?

• What factors might hurt your career? (If you work for a bank or a
homebuilder, a jump in interest rates could put you out of a job. If
you work for a chemical manufacturer, soaring oil prices could be
bad news.)
If you are self-employed, how long do businesses similar to yours
tend to survive?
Do you need your investments to supplement your cash income?
(In general, bonds will; stocks won’t.)

•

•

• Given  your  salary  and  your  spending  needs,  how  much  money

can you afford to lose on your investments?

If, after considering these factors, you feel you can take the higher
risks  inherent  in  greater  ownership  of  stocks,  you  belong  around
Graham’s minimum of 25% in bonds or cash. If not, then steer mostly
clear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s maximum of 75% in bonds
or  cash.  (To  find  out  whether  you  can  go  up  to  100%,  see  the 
sidebar on p. 105.)

Once you set these target percentages, change them only as your
life circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stock
market has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The
very heart of Graham’s approach is to replace guesswork with disci-
pline. Fortunately, through your 401(k), it’s easy to put your portfolio
on permanent autopilot. Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high
level of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. If
the stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have
just under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.5 Visit your 401(k)’s
website  (or  call  its  toll-free  number)  and  sell  enough  of  your  stock
funds to “rebalance” back to your 70–30 target. The key is to rebal-
ance  on  a  predictable,  patient  schedule—not  so  often  that  you  will

Graham advises you never to have more than 75% of your total
assets  in  stocks.  But  is  putting  all  your  money  into  the  stock
market inadvisable for everyone? For a tiny minority of investors,
a 100%-stock portfolio may make sense. You are one of them 
if you:

• have set aside enough cash to support your family for at least

one year

• will be investing steadily for at least 20 years to come
• survived the bear market that began in 2000
• did not sell stocks during the bear market that began in 2000
• bought  more  stocks  during  the  bear  market  that  began  in

2000

• have read Chapter 8 in this book and implemented a formal

plan to control your own investing behavior.

Unless  you  can  honestly  pass  all  these  tests,  you  have  no
business putting all your money in stocks. Anyone who panicked
in the last bear market is going to panic in the next one—and will
regret having no cushion of cash and bonds.

drive yourself crazy, and not so seldom that your targets will get out 
of  whack.  I  suggest  that  you  rebalance  every  six  months,  no  more 
and  no  less,  on  easy-to-remember  dates  like  New  Year’s  and  the
Fourth of July.

The beauty of this periodic rebalancing is that it forces you to base
your  investing  decisions  on  a  simple,  objective  standard—Do  I  now
own more of this asset than my plan calls for?—instead of the sheer
guesswork  of  where  interest  rates  are  heading  or  whether  you  think
the Dow is about to drop dead. Some mutual-fund companies, includ-
ing T. Rowe Price, may soon introduce services that will automatically
rebalance  your  401(k)  portfolio  to  your  preset  targets,  so  you  will
never need to make an active decision.

T H E   I N S   A N D   O U T S   O F   I N C O M E   I N V E S T I N G

In Graham’s day, bond investors faced two basic choices: Taxable or
tax-free?  Short-term  or  long-term?  Today  there  is  a  third:  Bonds  or
bond funds?

Taxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,6 you
should  buy  only  tax-free  (municipal)  bonds  outside  your  retirement
accounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the
hands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your
401(k)  or  another  sheltered  account,  where  you  will  owe  no  current
tax on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since
their tax advantage goes to waste.7

Short-term  or  long-term? Bonds  and  interest  rates  teeter  on
opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw:  If  interest  rates  rise,  bond  prices  fall—
although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the
other  hand,  if  interest  rates  fall,  bond  prices  rise—and  a  long-term
bond will outperform shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply

6 For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people
earning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than
$47,450.
7 Two  good  online  calculators  that  will  help  you  compare  the  after-tax  in-
come of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.
com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl  and  www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html.  To
decide if a “muni” is right for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” gener-
ated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently
available on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html).  If  the  yield  on  Treasury  bonds  is
higher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any case,
be  warned  that  municipal  bonds  and  funds  produce  lower  income,  and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-
mum  tax,  which  now  hits  many  middle-income  Americans,  can  negate  the
advantages of municipal bonds.

of maturities, is another way of hedging interest-rate risk.

by buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 years—which
do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into
the ground either. For most investors, intermediate bonds are the sim-
plest choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing
what interest rates will do.

Bonds or bond funds? Since bonds are generally sold in $10,000
lots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the
risk  that  any  one  of  them  might  go  bust,  buying  individual  bonds
makes  no  sense  unless  you  have  at  least  $100,000  to  invest.  (The
only exception is bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, since they’re pro-
tected against default by the full force of the American government.)

Bond  funds  offer  cheap  and  easy  diversification,  along  with  the
convenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into
the  fund  at  current  rates  without  paying  a  commission.  For  most
investors,  bond  funds  beat  individual  bonds  hands  down  (the  main
exceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major
firms like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price offer a broad
menu of bond funds at low cost.9

The  choices  for  bond  investors  have  proliferated  like  rabbits,  so
let’s  update  Graham’s  list  of  what’s  available.  As  of  2003,  interest
rates have fallen so low that investors are starved for yield, but there
are ways of amplifying your interest income without taking on exces-
sive risk.10 Figure 4-1 summarizes the pros and cons.

Now let’s look at a few types of bond investments that can fill spe-

cial needs.

“Ease of sale before maturity” indicates how readily you can sell at a fair
price before maturity date; mutual funds typically offer better ease of sale
than  individual  bonds.  Money-market  funds  are  Federally  insured  up  to
$100,000 if purchased at an FDIC-member bank, but otherwise carry only
an implicit pledge not to lose value. Federal income tax on savings bonds
is  deferred  until  redemption  or  maturity.  Municipal  bonds  are  generally
exempt from state income tax only in the state where they were issued.

virtually no credit risk—since, instead of defaulting on his debts, Uncle
Sam can just jack up taxes or print more money at will. Treasury bills
mature in four, 13, or 26 weeks. Because of their very short maturities,
T-bills  barely  get  dented  when  rising  interest  rates  knock  down  the
prices of other income investments; longer-term Treasury debt, how-
ever, suffers severely when interest rates rise. The interest income on
Treasury  securities  is  generally  free  from  state  (but  not  Federal)
income tax. And, with $3.7 trillion in public hands, the market for Trea-
sury debt is immense, so you can readily find a buyer if you need your
money  back  before  maturity.  You  can  buy  Treasury  bills,  short-term
notes, and long-term bonds directly from the government, with no bro-
kerage  fees,  at  www.publicdebt.treas.gov.  (For  more  on  inflation-
protected TIPS, see the commentary on Chapter 2.)

Savings bonds, unlike Treasuries, are not marketable; you cannot

sell them to another investor, and you’ll forfeit three months of interest
if  you  redeem  them  in  less  than  five  years.  Thus  they  are  suitable
mainly as “set-aside money” to meet a future spending need—a gift for
a religious ceremony that’s years away, or a jump start on putting your
newborn  through  Harvard.  They  come  in  denominations  as  low  as
$25,  making  them  ideal  as  gifts  to  grandchildren.  For  investors  who
can confidently leave some cash untouched for years to come, infla-
tion-protected “I-bonds” recently offered an attractive yield of around
4%. To learn more, see www.savingsbonds.gov.

Mortgage  securities. Pooled  together  from  thousands  of  mort-
gages around the United States, these bonds are issued by agencies
like the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the
Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). However,
they are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, so they sell at higher yields to
reflect their greater risk. Mortgage bonds generally underperform when
interest rates fall and bomb when rates rise. (Over the long run, those
swings tend to even out and the higher average yields pay off.) Good
mortgage-bond funds are available from Vanguard, Fidelity, and Pimco.
But  if  a  broker  ever  tries  to  sell  you  an  individual  mortgage  bond  or
“CMO,” tell him you are late for an appointment with your proctologist.
Annuities. These insurance-like investments enable you to defer cur-
rent taxes and capture a stream of income after you retire. Fixed annuities
offer a set rate of return; variable ones provide a fluctuating return. But
what the defensive investor really needs to defend against here are the
hard-selling insurance agents, stockbrokers, and financial planners who
peddle  annuities  at  rapaciously  high  costs.  In  most  cases,  the  high
expenses of owning an annuity—including “surrender charges” that gnaw
away at your early withdrawals—will overwhelm its advantages. The few
good annuities are bought, not sold; if an annuity produces fat commis-
sions for the seller, chances are it will produce meager results for the
buyer. Consider only those you can buy directly from providers with rock-
bottom costs like Ameritas, TIAA-CREF, and Vanguard.11

11 In general, variable annuities are not attractive for investors under the age
of 50 who expect to be in a high tax bracket during retirement or who have

Preferred  stock. Preferred  shares  are  a  worst-of-both-worlds
investment. They are less secure than bonds, since they have only a
secondary claim on a company’s assets if it goes bankrupt. And they
offer  less  profit  potential  than  common  stocks  do,  since  companies
typically “call” (or forcibly buy back) their preferred shares when inter-
est rates drop or their credit rating improves. Unlike the interest pay-
ments  on  most  of  its  bonds,  an  issuing  company  cannot  deduct
preferred dividend payments from its corporate tax bill. Ask yourself: If
this  company  is  healthy  enough  to  deserve  my  investment,  why  is  it
paying a fat dividend on its preferred stock instead of issuing bonds
and getting a tax break? The likely answer is that the company is not
healthy, the market for its bonds is glutted, and you should approach
its  preferred  shares  as  you  would  approach  an  unrefrigerated  dead
fish.

Common  stock. A  visit  to  the  stock  screener  at  http://screen.
yahoo.com/stocks.html in early 2003 showed that 115 of the stocks in
the  Standard  &  Poor’s  500  index  had  dividend  yields  of  3.0%  or
greater. No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for yield, would
ever buy a stock for its dividend income alone; the company and its
businesses  must  be  solid,  and  its  stock  price  must  be  reasonable.
But,  thanks  to  the  bear  market  that  began  in  2000,  some  leading
stocks are now outyielding Treasury bonds. So even the most defen-
sive  investor  should  realize  that  selectively  adding  stocks  to  an  all-
bond or mostly-bond portfolio can increase its income yield—and raise
its potential return.12

render  fees.  For  thorough  and  objective  analysis  of  annuities,  see  two

The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

Investment Merits of Common Stocks

In  our  first  edition  (1949)  we  found  it  necessary  at  this  point 
to  insert  a  long  exposition  of  the  case  for  including  a  substantial
common-stock component in all investment portfolios.* Common
stocks  were  generally  viewed  as  highly  speculative  and  therefore
unsafe; they had declined fairly substantially from the high levels
of 1946, but instead of attracting investors to them because of their
reasonable prices, this fall had had the opposite effect of undermin-
ing  confidence  in  equity  securities.  We  have  commented  on  the
converse  situation  that  has  developed  in  the  ensuing  20  years,
whereby  the  big  advance  in  stock  prices  made  them  appear  safe
and profitable investments at record high levels which might actu-
ally carry with them a considerable degree of risk.†

The  argument  we  made  for  common  stocks  in  1949  turned  on

* At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by stocks
over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term Treasury
bonds—meaning  that  $10,000  invested  in  stocks  would  have  grown  to
$18,415  over  that  period,  while  the  same  amount  in  bonds  would  have
turned  into  $21,494.  Naturally  enough,  1949  turned  out  to  be  a  fabulous
time to buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock
index  gained  an  average  of  20.1%  per  year,  one  of  the  best  long-term
returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.
† Graham’s  earlier  comments  on  this  subject  appear  on  pp.  19–20.  Just
imagine  what  he  would  have  thought  about  the  stock  market  of  the  late
1990s,  in  which  each  new  record-setting  high  was  considered  further
“proof” that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!

two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable
degree  of  protection  against  the  erosion  of  the  investor’s  dollar
caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The
second  advantage  of  common  stocks  lay  in  their  higher  average
return to investors over the years. This was produced both by an
average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and
by  an  underlying  tendency  for  market  value  to  increase  over  the
years in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.

While  these  two  advantages  have  been  of  major  importance—
and  have  given  common  stocks  a  far  better  record  than  bonds 
over the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these
benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price
for his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years
for  the  market  level  to  climb  back  to  the  ledge  from  which  it 
had  abysmally  fallen  in  1929–1932.*  Since  1957  common  stocks
have  once  again,  through  their  high  prices,  lost  their  traditional
advantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains to

* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17
on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,
1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit 382.74. (When you
say you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do you realize just how long
the long run can be—or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no
longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested
their income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,
simply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-
ing to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London
Business School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent
all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.
But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have
been  worth  $16,797!  Far  from  being  an  afterthought,  dividends  are  the
greatest force in stock investing.
† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock’s
yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common
stock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100
per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price doubles while the dividend
stays constant, the dividend yield will drop to 1%. In 1959, when the trend
Graham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone, most Wall Street

be seen whether the inflation factor and the economic-growth fac-
tor will make up in the future for this significantly adverse devel-
opment.

It should be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm
for common stocks in general at the 900 DJIA level of late 1971. For
reasons  already  given*  we  feel  that  the  defensive  investor  cannot
afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks
in  his  portfolio,  even  if  he  must  regard  them  as  the  lesser  of  two
evils—the greater being the risks attached to an all-bond holding.

Rules for the Common-Stock Component

The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive
investor should be a relatively simple matter. Here we would sug-
gest four rules to be followed:

1.  There  should  be  adequate  though  not  excessive  diversifica-
tion.  This  might  mean  a  minimum  of  ten  different  issues  and  a
maximum of about thirty.†

2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and con-
servatively  financed.  Indefinite  as  these  adjectives  must  be,  their
general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the
end of the chapter.

3. Each company should have a long record of continuous divi-
dend payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-

pundits  declared  that  it  could  not  possibly  last.  Never  before  had  stocks
yielded less than bonds; after all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why
would anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to com-
pensate for their greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield
stocks for a few months at most, and then things would revert to “normal.”
More than four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again;
the  yield  on  stocks  has  (so  far)  continuously  stayed  below  the  yield  on
bonds.

age met this dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this
point  we  would  suggest  the  requirement  of  continuous  dividend
payments beginning at least in 1950.*

4.  The  investor  should  impose  some  limit  on  the  price  he  will
pay  for  an  issue  in  relation  to  its  average  earnings  over,  say,  the
past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such
average  earnings,  and  not  more  than  20  times  those  of  the  last
twelve-month  period.  But  such  a  restriction  would  eliminate
nearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port-
folio.  In  particular,  it  would  ban  virtually  the  entire  category  of
“growth stocks,” which have for some years past been the favorites
of  both  speculators  and  institutional  investors.  We  must  give  our
reasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.

Growth Stocks and the Defensive Investor

The term “growth stock” is applied to one which has increased
its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common
stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future.
(Some  authorities  would  say  that  a  true  growth  stock  should  be
expected at least to double its per-share earnings in ten years—i.e.,
to  increase  them  at  a  compounded  annual  rate  of  over  7.1%.)†
Obviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own, pro-
vided  the  price  paid  is  not  excessive.  The  problem  lies  there,  of

* Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of
continuous  dividend  payments  (which  would  eliminate  from  consideration
only  one  member  of  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average—Microsoft—and
would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500
index). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would
not  be  overly  restrictive;  according  to  Morgan  Stanley,  255  companies  in
the S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.
† The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an
amount  of  money  takes  to  double,  simply  divide  its  assumed  growth  rate
into 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by 
6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its
earnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1 years).

116

The Intelligent Investor

course, since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation
to current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average
profits  over  a  past  period.  This  has  introduced  a  speculative  ele-
ment  of  considerable  weight  in  the  growth-stock  picture  and  has
made successful operations in this field a far from simple matter.

The leading growth issue has long been International Business
Machines,  and  it  has  brought  phenomenal  rewards  to  those  who
bought  it  years  ago  and  held  on  to  it  tenaciously.  But  we  have
already  pointed  out *  that  this  “best  of  common  stocks”  actually
lost 50% of its market price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62
and  nearly  the  same  percentage  in  1969–70.  Other  growth  stocks
have been even more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some
cases  not  only  has  the  price  fallen  back  but  the  earnings  as  well,
thus  causing  a  double  discomfiture  to  those  who  owned  them. A
good second example for our purpose is Texas Instruments, which
in six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a dividend, while its
earnings increased from 40 cents to $3.91 per share. (Note that the
price advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is characteristic
of popular common stocks.) But two years later the earnings had
dropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths, to 49.†

The reader will understand from these instances why we regard
growth stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for
the  defensive  investor.  Of  course,  wonders  can  be  accomplished
with the right individual selections, bought at the right levels, and
later sold after a huge rise and before the probable decline. But the
average investor can no more expect to accomplish this than to find
money  growing  on  trees.  In  contrast  we  think  that  the  group  of

* Graham makes this point on p. 73.
† To show that Graham’s observations are perennially true, we can substi-
tute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty years apart,
the  results  are  uncannily  similar:  Microsoft’s  stock  dropped  55.7%  from
2000 through 2002, while Cisco’s stock—which had risen roughly 50-fold
over the previous six years—lost 76% of its value from 2000 through 2002.
As with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco’s stock price was sharper than
the fall in its earnings, which dropped just 39.2% (comparing the three-year
average  for  1997–1999  against  2000–2002).  As  always,  the  hotter  they
are, the harder they fall.

large  companies  that  are  relatively  unpopular,  and  therefore
obtainable  at  reasonable  earnings  multipliers,*  offers  a  sound  if
unspectacular area of choice by the general public. We shall illus-
trate this idea in our chapter on portfolio selection.

Portfolio Changes

It  is  now  standard  practice  to  submit  all  security  lists  for  peri-
odic  inspection  in  order  to  see  whether  their  quality  can  be
improved. This, of course, is a major part of the service provided
for clients by investment counselors. Nearly all brokerage houses
are ready to make corresponding suggestions, without special fee,
in  return  for  the  commission  business  involved.  Some  brokerage
houses maintain investment services on a fee basis.

Presumably our defensive investor should obtain—at least once
a year—the same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio
as  he  sought  when  his  funds  were  first  committed.  Since  he  will
have little expertness of his own on which to rely, it is essential that
he  entrust  himself  only  to  firms  of  the  highest  reputation;  other-
wise he may easily fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands. It
is important, in any case, that at every such consultation he make
clear  to  his  adviser  that  he  wishes  to  adhere  closely  to  the  four
rules of common-stock selection given earlier in this chapter. Inci-
dentally,  if  his  list  has  been  competently  selected  in  the  first
instance,  there  should  be  no  need  for  frequent  or  numerous
changes.†

* “Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios, which
measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared to the
profitability of the underlying business. (See footnote † on p. 70 in Chapter 3.)
† Investors  can  now  set  up  their  own  automated  system  to  monitor  the 
quality of their holdings by using interactive “portfolio trackers” at such web-
sites as www.quicken.com, moneycentral.msn.com, finance.yahoo.com, and
www.morningstar.com. Graham would, however, warn against relying exclu-
sively on such a system; you must use your own judgment to supplement
the software.

The Intelligent Investor

Dollar-Cost Averaging

The New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into
popularizing  its  “monthly  purchase  plan,”  under  which  an
investor  devotes  the  same  dollar  amount  each  month  to  buying
one or more common stocks. This is an application of a special type
of  “formula  investment”  known  as  dollar-cost  averaging.  During
the predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results
from such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-
cially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his
buying at the wrong times.

In  Lucile  Tomlinson’s  comprehensive  study  of  formula  invest-
ment  plans,1 the  author  presented  a  calculation  of  the  results  of 
dollar-cost  averaging  in  the  group  of  stocks  making  up  the  Dow
Jones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-
chase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test
showed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within
five years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the
23  buying  periods  was  21.5%,  exclusive  of  dividends  received.
Needless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-
rary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-
sion  of  this  ultrasimple  investment  formula  with  the  striking
sentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-
ing  which  can  be  used  with  so  much  confidence  of  ultimate  suc-
cess,  regardless  of  what  may  happen  to  security  prices,  as  Dollar
Cost Averaging.”

It  may  be  objected  that  dollar-cost  averaging,  while  sound  in
principle, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so
situated that they can have available for common-stock investment
the same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to
me that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent
years. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-
sary  component  of  a  sound  savings-investment  program.  Thus,
systematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present
no  more  psychological  and  financial  difficulties  than  similar  con-
tinuous  payments  for  United  States  savings  bonds  and  for  life
insurance—to which they should be complementary. The monthly
amount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be
impressive and important to the saver.

The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

119

The Investor’s Personal Situation

At the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the posi-
tion of the individual portfolio owner. Let us return to this matter,
in the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what
extent  should  the  type  of  securities  selected  by  the  investor  vary
with his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely
different conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with
which to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in
mid-career,  with  savings  of  $100,000  and  yearly  accretions  of
$10,000;  and  (3)  a  young  man  earning  $200  per  week  and  saving
$1,000 a year.*

For the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-
ficult  one.  On  the  other  hand  the  need  for  conservatism  in  her
investments  is  paramount.  A division  of  her  fund  about  equally
between  United  States  bonds  and  first-grade  common  stocks  is  a
compromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-
eral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component
may be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-
pared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not
buying  at  too  high  a  level. Assuredly  this  is  not the  case  in  early
1972.)

We do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify
as an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-
ods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must not do is
to take speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.”
By this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-
essary  equipment  to  warrant  full  confidence  in  overall  success.  It
would be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-
cipal,  in  order  to  make  both  ends  meet,  than  to  risk  half  of  it  in
poorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.

The prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and
compulsions,  yet  we  believe  that  his  choices  are  pretty  much  the
same.  Is  he  willing  to  take  a  serious  interest  in  the  business  of
investment? If he lacks the impulse or the flair, he will do best to

The Intelligent Investor

accept  the  easy  role  of  the  defensive  investor.  The  division  of  his
portfolio  should  then  be  no  different  from  that  of  the  “typical”
widow, and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix-
ing the size of the stock component. The annual savings should be
invested in about the same proportions as the total fund.

The average doctor may be more likely than the average widow
to elect to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more
likely to succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handi-
cap, however—the fact that he has less time available to give to his
investment  education  and  to  the  administration  of  his  funds.  In
fact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-
rity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample
confidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a
good return on their money, without the realization that to do so
successfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and
something of a professional approach to security values.

Finally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year—and expects to
do better gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though
for still different reasons. Some of his savings should go automati-
cally  into  Series  E  bonds.  The  balance  is  so  modest  that  it  seems
hardly  worthwhile  for  him  to  undergo  a  tough  educational  and
temperamental  discipline  in  order  to  qualify  as  an  aggressive
investor.  Thus  a  simple  resort  to  our  standard  program  for  the
defensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi-
cal policy.

Let us not ignore human nature at this point. Finance has a fasci-
nation  for  many  bright  young  people  with  limited  means.  They
would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement
of  their  savings,  even  though  investment  income  is  much  less
important  to  them  than  their  salaries.  This  attitude  is  all  to  the
good. There is a great advantage for the young capitalist to begin
his financial education and experience early. If he is going to oper-
ate as an aggressive investor he is certain to make some mistakes
and  to  take  some  losses.  Youth  can  stand  these  disappointments
and profit by them. We urge the beginner in security buying not to
waste  his  efforts  and  his  money  in  trying  to  beat  the  market.  Let
him  study  security  values  and  initially  test  out  his  judgment  on
price versus value with the smallest possible sums.

Thus  we  return  to  the  statement,  made  at  the  outset,  that  the

The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

kind  of  securities  to  be  purchased  and  the  rate  of  return  to  be
sought depend not on the investor’s financial resources but on his
financial equipment in terms of knowledge, experience, and tem-
perament.

Note on the Concept of “Risk”

It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good
preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common
stocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-
mon stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated
in  the  Federal  Reserve  Board’s  survey  of  1948.  We  should  like  to
point out that the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securi-
ties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.

A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or
principal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-
mon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-
dend  will  be  continued,  then  a  reduction  or  passing  of  the
dividend  means  that  it  has  proved  unsafe.  It  is  also  true  that  an
investment  contains  a  risk  if  there  is  a  fair  possibility  that  the
holder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.
Nevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-
sible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may
be of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder
is unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-
ent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to
a greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior
issues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a
true  risk  in  the  useful  sense  of  the  term.  The  man  who  holds  a
mortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he
were  forced  to  sell  it  at  an  unfavorable  time.  That  element  is  not
taken  into  account  in  judging  the  safety  or  risk  of  ordinary  real-
estate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual
payments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-
mercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not
by what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.

In Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide
investor does not lose money merely because the market price of
his holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does

122

The Intelligent Investor

not mean that he is running a true risk of loss. If a group of well-
selected  common-stock  investments  shows  a  satisfactory  overall
return,  as  measured  through  a  fair  number  of  years,  then  this
group investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its
market value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell
for a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment
“risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the
same time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept
of  risk  solely  to  a  loss  of  value  which  either  is  realized  through
actual  sale,  or  is  caused  by  a  significant  deterioration  in  the
company’s  position—or,  more  frequently  perhaps,  is  the  result  of
the payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth
of the security.2

Many common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But
it is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com-
mon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that
therefore it should not be termed “risky” merely because of the ele-
ment of price fluctuation. But such risk is present if there is danger
that the price may prove to have been clearly too high by intrinsic-
value  standards—even  if  any  subsequent  severe  market  decline
may be recouped many years later.

Note on the Category of “Large, Prominent, 
and Conservatively Financed Corporations”

The quoted phrase in our caption was used earlier in the chapter
to  describe  the  kind  of  common  stocks  to  which  defensive
investors  should  limit  their  purchases—provided  also  that  they
had paid continuous dividends for a considerable number of years.
A criterion based on adjectives is always ambiguous. Where is the
dividing  line  for  size,  for  prominence,  and  for  conservatism  of
financial structure? On the last point we can suggest a specific stan-
dard  that,  though  arbitrary,  is  in  line  with  accepted  thinking. An
industrial company’s finances are not conservative unless the com-
mon stock (at book value) represents at least half of the total capi-
talization, including all bank debt.3 For a railroad or public utility
the figure should be at least 30%.

The words “large” and “prominent” carry the notion of substan-
tial  size  combined  with  a  leading  position  in  the  industry.  Such

The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

123

companies  are  often  referred  to  as  “primary”;  all  other  common
stocks  are  then  called  “secondary,”  except  that  growth  stocks  are
ordinarily  placed  in  a  separate  class  by  those  who  buy  them  as
such. To supply an element of concreteness here, let us suggest that
to be “large” in present-day terms a company should have $50 mil-
lion  of  assets  or  do  $50  million  of  business.* Again  to  be  “promi-
nent” a company should rank among the first quarter or first third
in size within its industry group.

It would be foolish, however, to insist upon such arbitrary crite-
ria.  They  are  offered  merely  as  guides  to  those  who  may  ask  for
guidance. But any rule which the investor may set for himself and
which does no violence to the common-sense meanings of “large”
and  “prominent”  should  be  acceptable.  By  the  very  nature  of  the
case there must be a large group of companies that some will and
others will not include among those suitable for defensive invest-
ment. There is no harm in such diversity of opinion and action. In
fact, it has a salutary effect upon stock-market conditions, because
it permits a gradual differentiation or transition between the cate-
gories of primary and secondary stock issues.

* In today’s markets, to be considered large, a company should have a total
stock value (or “market capitalization”) of at least $10 billion. According to
the online stock screener at http://screen.yahoo.com/stocks.html, that gave
you roughly 300 stocks to choose from as of early 2003.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 5

Human felicity is produc’d not so much by great Pieces of good
Fortune that seldom happen, as by little Advantages that occur
every day.

—Benjamin Franklin

T H E   B E S T   D E F E N S E   I S   A   G O O D   O F F E N S E

After the stock-market bloodbath of the past few years, why would any
defensive investor put a dime into stocks?

First, remember Graham’s insistence that how defensive you should
be depends less on your tolerance for risk than on your willingness to
put time and energy into your portfolio. And if you go about it the right
way, investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds
and cash. (As we’ll see in Chapter 9, you can buy a stock-market index
fund with no more effort than it takes to get dressed in the morning.)

Amidst the bear market that began in 2000, it’s understandable if
you  feel  burned—and  if,  in  turn,  that  feeling  makes  you  determined
never  to  buy  another  stock  again.  As  an  old  Turkish  proverb  says,
“After  you  burn  your  mouth  on  hot  milk,  you  blow  on  your  yogurt.”
Because  the  crash  of  2000–2002  was  so  terrible,  many  investors
now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of
crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot
milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.

Viewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has
nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning
them a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to
give you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the
losses they may have cost you in the recent past. That’s all the more
true when bond yields are low, reducing the future returns on income-
producing investments.

124

Commentary on Chapter 5

125

As we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only
mildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their
supposed  safety  is  like  a  smoker  who  thinks  he  can  protect  himself
against  lung  cancer  by  smoking  low-tar  cigarettes.  No  matter  how
defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance,
or in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you
must keep at least some of your money in stocks.

Fortunately,  it’s  never  been  easier  for  a  defensive  investor  to  buy
stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest-
ments,  can  defend  you  against  the  need  to  dedicate  a  large  part  of
your life to stock picking.

S H O U L D   Y O U   “ B U Y   W H A T   Y O U   K N O W ” ?

But  first,  let’s  look  at  something  the  defensive  investor  must  always
defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any
homework.  In  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  one  of  the  most  popular
investing  slogans  was  “buy  what  you  know.”  Peter  Lynch—who  from
1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record
ever compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of
this gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage
that professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of
common  knowledge.”  If  you  discover  a  great  new  restaurant,  car,
toothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby
business is always full or that people are still working at a company’s
headquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-
sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-
ager  might  never  pick  up  on.  As  Lynch  put  it,  “During  a  lifetime  of
buying  cars  or  cameras,  you  develop  a  sense  of  what’s  good  and
what’s  bad,  what  sells  and  what  doesn’t . . . and  the  most  important
part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it.” 1

Lynch’s rule—“You can outperform the experts if you use your edge
by investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t

Commentary on Chapter 5

totally  implausible,  and  thousands  of  investors  have  profited  from  it
over the years. But Lynch’s rule can work only if you follow its corollary
as well: “Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next
step  is  doing  the  research.”  To  his  credit,  Lynch  insists  that  no  one
should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or
how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements
and estimating its business value.

Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.
Barbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people
abuse Lynch’s teachings. In 1999 she burbled, “We go to Starbucks
every day, so I buy Starbucks stock.” But the Funny Girl forgot that no
matter how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to ana-
lyze  Starbucks’s  financial  statements  and  make  sure  the  stock  isn’t
even more overpriced than the coffee. Countless stock buyers made
the same mistake by loading up on shares of Amazon.com because
they loved the website or buying e*Trade stock because it was their
own online broker.

“Experts” gave the idea credence too. In an interview televised on
CNN  in  late  1999,  portfolio  manager  Kevin  Landis  of  the  Firsthand
Funds  was  asked  plaintively,  “How  do  you  do  it?  Why  can’t  I  do  it,
Kevin?” (From 1995 through the end of 1999, the Firsthand Technol-
ogy  Value  fund  produced  an  astounding  58.2%  average  annualized
gain.) “Well, you can do it,” Landis chirped. “All you really need to do is
focus on the things that you know, and stay close to an industry, and
talk to people who work in it every day.” 2

The most painful perversion of Lynch’s rule occurred in corporate
retirement  plans.  If  you’re  supposed  to  “buy  what  you  know,”  then
what could possibly be a better investment for your 401(k) than your
own company’s stock? After all, you work there; don’t you know more
about the company than an outsider ever could? Sadly, the employees

eastern standard time. If Landis’s own record is any indication, focusing on
“the things that you know” is not “all you really need to do” to pick stocks
successfully. From the end of 1999 through the end of 2002, Landis’s fund
(full of technology companies that he claimed to know “firsthand” from his
base in Silicon Valley) lost 73.2% of its value, an even worse pounding than
the average technology fund suffered over that period.

of Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom—many of whom put nearly
all  their  retirement  assets  in  their  own  company’s  stock,  only  to  be
wiped  out—learned  that  insiders  often  possess  only  the  illusion  of
knowledge, not the real thing.

Psychologists led by Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity have documented a disturbing fact: becoming more familiar with a
subject does not significantly reduce people’s tendency to exaggerate
how much they actually know about it.3 That’s why “investing in what
you know” can be so dangerous; the more you know going in, the less
likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses. This pernicious form of
overconfidence is called “home bias,” or the habit of sticking to what is
already familiar:

•

•

•

Individual  investors  own  three  times  more  shares  in  their  local
phone company than in all other phone companies combined.
The typical mutual fund owns stocks whose headquarters are 115
miles closer to the fund’s main office than the average U.S. com-
pany is.
401(k) investors keep between 25% and 30% of their retirement
assets in the stock of their own company.4

In  short,  familiarity  breeds  complacency.  On  the  TV  news,  isn’t  it
always the neighbor or the best friend or the parent of the criminal who
says in a shocked voice, “He was such a nice guy”? That’s because
whenever  we  are  too  close  to  someone  or  something,  we  take  our
beliefs for granted, instead of questioning them as we do when we con-
front something more remote. The more familiar a stock is, the more
likely it is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who thinks there’s
no need to do any homework. Don’t let that happen to you.

Fortunately, for a defensive investor who is willing to do the required
homework  for  assembling  a  stock  portfolio,  this  is  the  Golden  Age:
Never  before  in  financial  history  has  owning  stocks  been  so  cheap
and convenient.5

Do  it  yourself. Through  specialized  online  brokerages  like  www.
sharebuilder.com,  www.foliofn.com,  and  www.buyandhold.com,  you
can buy stocks automatically even if you have very little cash to spare.
These websites charge as little as $4 for each periodic purchase of
any  of  the  thousands  of  U.S.  stocks  they  make  available.  You  can
invest  every  week  or  every  month,  reinvest  the  dividends,  and  even
trickle  your  money  into  stocks  through  electronic  withdrawals  from
your bank account or direct deposit from your paycheck. Sharebuilder
charges  more  to  sell  than  to  buy—reminding  you,  like  a  little  whack
across  the  nose  with  a  rolled-up  newspaper,  that  rapid  selling  is  an
investing no-no—while FolioFN offers an excellent tax-tracking tool.

Unlike traditional brokers or mutual funds that won’t let you in the door
for  less  than  $2,000  or  $3,000,  these  online  firms  have  no  minimum
account balances and are tailor-made for beginning investors who want
to put fledgling portfolios on autopilot. To be sure, a transaction fee of 
$4 takes a monstrous 8% bite out of a $50 monthly investment—but if
that’s all the money you can spare, then these microinvesting sites are
the only game in town for building a diversified portfolio.

You can also buy individual stocks straight from the issuing compa-
nies.  In  1994,  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  loos-
ened  the  handcuffs  it  had  long  ago  clamped  onto  the  direct  sale  of
stocks to the public. Hundreds of companies responded by creating
Internet-based  programs  allowing  investors  to  buy  shares  without
going through a broker. Some helpful online sources of information on
buying  stocks  directly  include  www.dripcentral.com,  www.netstock
direct.com  (an  affiliate  of  Sharebuilder),  and  www.stockpower.com.

5 According  to  finance  professor  Charles  Jones  of  Columbia  Business
School, the cost of a small, one-way trade (either a buy or a sell) in a New
York Stock Exchange–listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in Graham’s
day to about 0.25% in 2000. For institutions like mutual funds, those costs
are actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, “A Century of Stock Market Li-
quidity and Trading Costs,” at http://papers.ssrn.com.)

You may often incur a variety of nuisance fees that can exceed $25
per year. Even so, direct-stock purchase programs are usually cheaper
than stockbrokers.

Be warned, however, that buying stocks in tiny increments for years
on end can set off big tax headaches. If you are not prepared to keep
a  permanent  and  exhaustively  detailed  record  of  your  purchases,  do
not buy in the first place. Finally, don’t invest in only one stock—or even
just a handful of different stocks. Unless you are not willing to spread
your  bets,  you  shouldn’t  bet  at  all.  Graham’s  guideline  of  owning
between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors
who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you
are  not  overexposed  to  one  industry.6 (For  more  on  how  to  pick  the
individual  stocks  that  will  make  up  your  portfolio,  see  pp.  114–115
and Chapters 11, 14, and 15.)

If, after you set up such an online autopilot portfolio, you find your-
self trading more than twice a year—or spending more than an hour or
two per month, total, on your investments—then something has gone
badly wrong. Do not let the ease and up-to-the-minute feel of the Inter-
net  seduce  you  into  becoming  a  speculator.  A  defensive  investor
runs—and wins—the race by sitting still.

Get some help. A defensive investor can also own stocks through
a discount broker, a financial planner, or a full-service stockbroker. At a
discount brokerage, you’ll need to do most of the stock-picking work
yourself;  Graham’s  guidelines  will  help  you  create  a  core  portfolio
requiring minimal maintenance and offering maximal odds of a steady
return. On the other hand, if you cannot spare the time or summon the
interest to do it yourself, there’s no reason to feel any shame in hiring
someone  to  pick  stocks  or  mutual  funds  for  you.  But  there’s  one
responsibility that you must never delegate. You, and no one but you,
must  investigate  (before you  hand  over  your  money)  whether  an
adviser is trustworthy and charges reasonable fees. (For more point-
ers, see Chapter 10.)

Farm  it  out. Mutual  funds  are  the  ultimate  way  for  a  defensive
investor to capture the upside of stock ownership without the down-

side of having to police your own portfolio. At relatively low cost, you
can  buy  a  high  degree  of  diversification  and  convenience—letting  a
professional  pick  and  watch  the  stocks  for  you.  In  their  finest  form—
index  portfolios—mutual  funds  can  require  virtually  no  monitoring  or
maintenance  whatsoever.  Index  funds  are  a  kind  of  Rip  Van  Winkle
investment  that  is  highly  unlikely  to  cause  any  suffering  or  surprises
even  if,  like  Washington  Irving’s  lazy  farmer,  you  fall  asleep  for  20
years.  They  are  a  defensive  investor’s  dream  come  true.  For  more
detail, see Chapter 9.

F I L L I N G   I N   T H E   P O T H O L E S

As the financial markets heave and crash their way up and down day
after  day,  the  defensive  investor  can  take  control  of  the  chaos.  Your
very refusal to be active, your renunciation of any pretended ability to
predict the future, can become your most powerful weapons. By put-
ting every investment decision on autopilot, you drop any self-delusion
that  you  know  where  stocks  are  headed,  and  you  take  away  the
market’s power to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces.

As Graham notes, “dollar-cost averaging” enables you to put a fixed
amount of money into an investment at regular intervals. Every week,
month, or calendar quarter, you buy more—whether the markets have
gone (or are about to go) up, down, or sideways. Any major mutual fund
company  or  brokerage  firm  can  automatically  and  safely  transfer  the
money electronically for you, so you never have to write a check or feel
the conscious pang of payment. It’s all out of sight, out of mind.

The  ideal  way  to  dollar-cost  average  is  into  a  portfolio  of  index
funds,  which  own  every  stock  or  bond  worth  having.  That  way,  you
renounce  not  only  the  guessing  game  of  where  the  market  is  going
but which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds
within them—will do the best.

Let’s say you can spare $500 a month. By owning and dollar-cost
averaging  into  just  three  index  funds—$300  into  one  that  holds  the
total U.S. stock market, $100 into one that holds foreign stocks, and
$100  into  one  that  holds  U.S.  bonds—you  can  ensure  that  you  own
almost  every  investment  on  the  planet  that’s  worth  owning.7 Every

month, like clockwork, you buy more. If the market has dropped, your
preset amount goes further, buying you more shares than the month
before.  If  the  market  has  gone  up,  then  your  money  buys  you  fewer
shares. By putting your portfolio on permanent autopilot this way, you
prevent yourself from either flinging money at the market just when it is
seems  most  alluring  (and  is  actually  most  dangerous)  or  refusing  to
buy  more  after  a  market  crash  has  made  investments  truly  cheaper
(but seemingly more “risky”).

According  to  Ibbotson  Associates,  the  leading  financial  research
firm, if you had invested $12,000 in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock
index at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you would
have had only $7,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry $100
and simply invested another $100 every single month, then by August
1939, your money would have grown to $15,571! That’s the power of
disciplined buying—even in the face of the Great Depression and the
worst bear market of all time.8

Figure 5-1 shows the magic of dollar-cost averaging in a more re-

cent bear market.

Best  of  all,  once  you  build  a  permanent  autopilot  portfolio  with
index funds as its heart and core, you’ll be able to answer every mar-
ket  question  with  the  most  powerful  response  a  defensive  investor
could  ever  have:  “I  don’t  know  and  I  don’t  care.”  If  someone  asks
whether bonds will outperform stocks, just answer, “I don’t know and I
don’t care”—after all, you’re automatically buying both. Will health-care
stocks  make  high-tech  stocks  look  sick?  “I  don’t  know  and  I  don’t
care”—you’re a permanent owner of both. What’s the next Microsoft?
“I  don’t  know  and  I  don’t  care”—as  soon  as  it’s  big  enough  to  own,
your index fund will have it, and you’ll go along for the ride. Will foreign
stocks beat U.S. stocks next year? “I don’t know and I don’t care”—if
they do, you’ll capture that gain; if they don’t, you’ll get to buy more at
lower prices.

By enabling you to say “I don’t know and I don’t care,” a permanent
autopilot portfolio liberates you from the feeling that you need to fore-
cast what the financial markets are about to do—and the illusion that

Although it was not possible for retail investors to buy the entire S & P 500
index until 1976, the example nevertheless proves the power of buying more
when stock prices go down.

Cumulative value of $100 invested monthly in Vanguard 500 Index Fund 
Monthly closing price, Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index

From the end of 1999 through the end of 2002, the S & P 500-stock average fell
relentlessly. But if you had opened an index-fund account with a $3,000 mini-
mum  investment  and  added  $100  every  month,  your  total  outlay  of  $6,600
would have lost 30.2%—considerably less than the 41.3% plunge in the market.
Better yet, your steady buying at lower prices would build the base for an explo-
sive recovery when the market rebounds.

anyone else can. The knowledge of how little you can know about the
future, coupled with the acceptance of your ignorance, is a defensive
investor’s most powerful weapon.

CHAPTER 6

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising

Investor: Negative Approach

The “aggressive” investor should start from the same base as the
defensive  investor,  namely,  a  division  of  his  funds  between  high-
grade bonds and high-grade common stocks bought at reasonable
prices.* He will be prepared to branch out into other kinds of secu-
rity  commitments,  but  in  each  case  he  will  want  a  well-reasoned
justification  for  the  departure.  There  is  a  difficulty  in  discussing
this topic in orderly fashion, because there is no single or ideal pat-
tern for aggressive operations. The field of choice is wide; the selec-
tion should depend not only on the individual’s competence and
equipment but perhaps equally well upon his interests and prefer-
ences.

The most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are
of a negative sort. Let him leave high-grade preferred stocks to cor-
porate buyers. Let him also avoid inferior types of bonds and pre-

* Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in Chapter 1
that the definition of an “enterprising” investor depends not on the amount
of risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing to put in, Graham
falls  back  on  the  conventional  notion  that  enterprising  investors  are  more
“aggressive.”  The  rest  of  the  chapter,  however,  makes  clear  that  Graham
stands by his original definition. (The great British economist John Maynard
Keynes appears to have been the first to use the term “enterprise” as a syn-
onym for analytical investment.)

issues, and much less for the lower coupons.* He will let someone
else  buy  foreign-government  bond  issues,  even  though  the  yield
may be attractive. He will also be wary of all kinds of new issues,
including convertible bonds and preferreds that seem quite tempt-
ing  and  common  stocks  with  excellent  earnings  confined  to  the
recent past.

For  standard  bond  investments  the  aggressive  investor  would
do well to follow the pattern suggested to his defensive confrere,
and make his choice between high-grade taxable issues, which can
now  be  selected  to  yield  about  71⁄4%,  and  good-quality  tax-free
bonds, which yield up to 5.30% on longer maturities.†

Second-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks

Since in late-1971 it is possible to find first-rate corporate bonds
to yield 71⁄4%, and even more, it would not make much sense to buy
second-grade issues merely for the higher return they offer. In fact
corporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir-
tually  impossible  to  sell  “straight  bonds”—i.e.,  nonconvertibles—
to the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has
been done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants
attached), which place them in a separate category. It follows that
virtually  all  the  nonconvertible  bonds  of  inferior  rating  represent
older issues which are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer
the possibility of a substantial gain in principal value under favor-
able future conditions—which would mean here a combination of
an  improved  credit  rating  for  the  company  and  lower  general
interest rates.

* “High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average interest
rates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks paying large divi-
dend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high rates of interest in
order to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal that it is risky. For more
on high-yield or “junk” bonds, see pp. 145–147.
† As  of  early  2003,  the  equivalent  yields  are  roughly  5.1%  on  high-grade
corporate  bonds  and  4.7%  on  20-year  tax-free  municipal  bonds.  To  up-
date these yields, see www.bondsonline.com/asp/news/composites/html or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.html and www.bloomberg.com/markets/
psamuni.html.

But even in the matter of price discounts and resultant chance of
principal gain, the second-grade bonds are in competition with bet-
ter  issues.  Some  of  the  well-entrenched  obligations  with  “old-
style” coupon rates (21⁄2% to 4%) sold at about 50 cents on the dollar
in 1970. Examples: American Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄8s, due 1986
sold at 51; Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe RR 4s, due 1995, sold at 51;
McGraw-Hill 37⁄8s, due 1992, sold at 501⁄2.

Hence  under  conditions  of  late-1971  the  enterprising  investors
can probably get from good-grade bonds selling at a large discount
all that he should reasonably desire in the form of both income and
chance of appreciation.

Throughout this book we refer to the possibility that any well-
defined and protracted market situation of the past may return in
the  future.  Hence  we  should  consider  what  policy  the  aggressive
investor might have to choose in the bond field if prices and yields
of high-grade issues should return to former normals. For this rea-
son  we  shall  reprint  here  our  observations  on  that  point  made  in
the 1965 edition, when high-grade bonds yielded only 41⁄2%.

Something should be said now about investing in second-grade
issues, which can readily be found to yield any specified return up
to  8%  or  more.  The  main  difference  between  first-  and  second-
grade  bonds  is  usually  found  in  the  number  of  times  the  interest
charges  have  been  covered  by  earnings.  Example:  In  early  1964
Chicago,  Milwaukee,  St.  Paul  and  Pacific  5%  income  debenture
bonds,  at  68,  yielded  7.35%.  But  the  total  interest  charges  of  the
road,  before  income  taxes,  were  earned  only  1.5  times  in  1963,
against  our  requirement  of  5  times  for  a  well-protected  railroad
issue.1

Many  investors  buy  securities  of  this  kind  because  they  “need
income”  and  cannot  get  along  with  the  meager  return  offered  by
top-grade issues. Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy
a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because
the  yield  is  attractive.*  (Here  the  word  “merely”  implies  that  the
issue  is  not  selling  at  a  large  discount  and  thus  does  not  offer  an
opportunity for a substantial gain in principal value.) Where such
securities are bought at full prices—that is, not many points under

100 *—the  chances  are  very  great  that  at  some  future  time  the
holder  will  see  much  lower  quotations.  For  when  bad  business
comes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove highly sus-
ceptible  to  severe  sinking  spells;  often  interest  or  dividends  are 
suspended  or  at  least  endangered,  and  frequently  there  is  a  pro-
nounced price weakness even though the operating results are not
at all bad.

As a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality
senior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten
railroad income bonds in 1946–47. These comprise all of those which
sold at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 1021⁄2. By the
following year the group had registered low prices averaging only
68,  a  loss  of  one-third  of  the  market  value  in  a  very  short  time.
Peculiarly  enough,  the  railroads  of  the  country  were  showing
much better earnings in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price
decline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of
the selloff in the general market. But it should be pointed out that
the  shrinkage  in  these  income  bonds  was  proportionately  larger
than  that  in  the  common  stocks in  the  Dow  Jones  industrial  list
(about  23%).  Obviously  the  purchaser  of  these  bonds  at  a  cost
above 100 could not have expected to participate to any extent in a
further rise in the securities market. The only attractive feature was
the  income  yield,  averaging  about  4.25%  (against  2.50%  for  first-
grade  bonds,  an  advantage  of  1.75%  in  annual  income).  Yet  the
sequel  showed  all  too  soon  and  too  plainly  that  for  the  minor
advantage  in  annual  income  the  buyer  of  these  second-grade
bonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal.

The above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu-
lar  fallacy  that  goes  under  the  sobriquet  of  a  “businessman’s
investment.”  That  involves  the  purchase  of  a  security  showing  a
larger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying 
a  correspondingly  greater  risk.  It  is  bad  business  to  accept  an

* Bond  prices  are  quoted  in  percentages  of  “par  value,”  or  100.  A  bond
priced  at  “85”  is  selling  at  85%  of  its  principal  value;  a  bond  originally
offered for $10,000, but now selling at 85, will cost $8,500. When bonds
sell below 100, they are called “discount” bonds; above 100, they become
“premium” bonds.

acknowledged  possibility  of  a  loss  of  principal  in  exchange  for  a
mere  1  or  2%  of  additional  yearly  income.  If  you  are  willing  to
assume  some  risk  you  should  be  certain  that  you  can  realize  a
really substantial gain in principal value if things go well. Hence a
second-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost always a bad
purchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense—and if you
are patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.

Second-grade  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  possess  two  contra-
dictory  attributes  which  the  intelligent  investor  must  bear  clearly
in mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On
the  other  hand,  a  large  proportion  recover  their  position  when
favorable  conditions  return,  and  these  ultimately  “work  out  all
right.” This is true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to
pay dividends for many years. There were a number of such issues
in the early 1940s, as a consequence of the long depression of the
1930s.  During  the  postwar  boom  period  of  1945–1947  many  of
these  large  accumulations  were  paid  off  either  in  cash  or  in  new
securities,  and  the  principal  was  often  discharged  as  well.  As  a
result, large profits were made by people who, a few years previ-
ously, had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold
at low prices.2

It  may  well  be  true  that,  in  an  overall  accounting,  the  higher
yields obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have
offset  those  principal  losses  that  were  irrecoverable.  In  other
words,  an  investor  who  bought  all  such  issues  at  their  offering
prices might conceivably fare as well, in the long run, as one who
limited himself to first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3
But  for  practical  purposes  the  question  is  largely  irrelevant.
Regardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full
prices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines
precipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure
an “average” result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of
his  larger  income  to  offset  or  “amortize”  those  principal  losses
which prove to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to
abstain  from  buying  securities  at  around  100  if  long  experience
indicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next
weak market.

Foreign Government Bonds

All  investors  with  even  small  experience  know  that  foreign
bonds, as a whole, have had a bad investment history since 1914.
This was inevitable in the light of two world wars and an interven-
ing  world  depression  of  unexampled  depth.  Yet  every  few  years
market  conditions  are  sufficiently  favorable  to  permit  the  sale  of
some new foreign issues at a price of about par. This phenomenon
tells  us  a  good  deal  about  the  working  of  the  average  investor’s
mind—and not only in the field of bonds.

We have no concrete reason to be concerned about the future his-
tory  of  well-regarded  foreign  bonds  such  as  those  of Australia  or
Norway. But we do know that, if and when trouble should come,
the  owner  of  foreign  obligations  has  no  legal  or  other  means  of
enforcing  his  claim.  Those  who  bought  Republic  of  Cuba  41⁄2s  as
high as 117 in 1953 saw them default their interest and then sell as
low  as  20  cents  on  the  dollar  in  1963.  The  New  York  Stock
Exchange bond list in that year also included Belgian Congo 51⁄4s at
36, Greek 7s at 30, and various issues of Poland as low as 7. How
many readers have any idea of the repeated vicissitudes of the 8%
bonds of Czechoslovakia, since they were first offered in this coun-
try in 1922 at 961⁄2? They advanced to 112 in 1928, declined to 673⁄4 in
1932,  recovered  to  106  in  1936,  collapsed  to  6  in  1939,  recovered
(unbelievably) to 117 in 1946, fell promptly to 35 in 1948, and sold
as low as 8 in 1970!

Years  ago  an  argument  of  sorts  was  made  for  the  purchase  of
foreign bonds here on the grounds that a rich creditor nation such
as  ours  was  under  moral  obligation  to  lend  abroad.  Time,  which
brings so many revenges, now finds us dealing with an intractable
balance-of-payments problem of our own, part of which is ascrib-
able  to  the  large-scale  purchase  of  foreign  bonds  by  American
investors seeking a small advantage in yield. For many years past
we  have  questioned  the  inherent  attractiveness  of  such  invest-
ments  from  the  standpoint  of  the  buyer;  perhaps  we  should  add
now that the latter would benefit both his country and himself if he
declined these opportunities.

New Issues Generally

It might seem ill-advised to attempt any broad statements about
new issues as a class, since they cover the widest possible range of
quality and attractiveness. Certainly there will be exceptions to any
suggested  rule.  Our  one  recommendation  is  that  all  investors
should  be  wary of  new  issues—which  means,  simply,  that  these
should  be  subjected  to  careful  examination  and  unusually  severe
tests before they are purchased.

There  are  two  reasons  for  this  double  caveat.  The  first  is  that
new  issues  have  special  salesmanship  behind  them,  which  calls
therefore for a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that
most  new  issues  are  sold  under  “favorable  market  conditions”—
which means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor-
able for the buyer.†

The effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor-
tant  as  we  go  down  the  scale  from  the  highest-quality  bonds
through second-grade senior issues to common-stock flotations at
the  bottom. A tremendous  amount  of  financing,  consisting  of  the
repayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by
new issues with lower coupons, was done in the past. Most of this
was in the category of high-grade bonds and preferred stocks. The
buyers were largely financial institutions, amply qualified to pro-
tect  their  interests.  Hence  these  offerings  were  carefully  priced  to

* New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or IPOs—normally are
sold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in commission) of 7%. By con-
trast,  the  buyer’s  commission  on  older  shares  of  common  stock  typically
ranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes roughly twice as much for
selling something new as it does for selling something old, the new will get
the harder sell.
† Recently,  finance  professors  Owen  Lamont  of  the  University  of  Chicago
and Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that corpora-
tions choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near
a peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see Lamont’s “Evaluating
Value  Weighting:  Corporate  Events  and  Market  Timing”  and  Schultz’s
“Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance of IPOs” at http://

meet  the  going  rate  for  comparable  issues,  and  high-powered
salesmanship had little effect on the outcome. As interest rates fell
lower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for
these  issues,  and  many  of  them  later  declined  appreciably  in  the
market. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu-
rities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer;
but in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the purchaser
are likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.

The  situation  proves  somewhat  different  when  we  study  the
lower-grade  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  sold  during  the  1945–46
and  1960–61  periods.  Here  the  effect  of  the  selling  effort  is  more
apparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with
individual  and  inexpert  investors.  It  was  characteristic  of  these
offerings  that  they  did  not  make  an  adequate  showing  when
judged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-
ber  of  years.  They  did  look  safe  enough,  for  the  most  part,  if  it
could be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without
a serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these
issues  presumably  accepted  this  assumption,  and  their  salesmen
had little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers
to a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-
ment, and one likely to prove costly.

Bull-market  periods  are  usually  characterized  by  the  transfor-
mation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-
panies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again
beginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-
tions  until  brought  to  a  catastrophic  close  in  May  1962. After  the
usual  “swearing-off”  period  of  several  years  the  whole  tragicom-
edy was repeated, step by step, in 1967–1969.*

* In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850 com-
panies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average of more than
one per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again; in 1969 an aston-
ishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped create the bear
markets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that
only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.
That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when
roughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to trigger the over-

New Common-Stock Offerings

The following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the

1959 edition, with comment added:

Common-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case
of companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata
to  the  existing  stockholders.  The  subscription  price  is  set  below 
the  current  market,  and  the  “rights”  to  subscribe  have  an  initial
money value.* The sale of the new shares is almost always under-
written  by  one  or  more  investment  banking  houses,  but  it  is  the
general hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken
by  the  exercise  of  the  subscription  rights.  Thus  the  sale  of  addi-
tional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call
for active selling effort on the part of distributing firms.

The  second  type  is  the  placement  with  the  public  of  common
stock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of
this  stock  is  sold  for  the  account  of  the  controlling  interests  to
enable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their

enthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash. Then the cycle swung the other way
again as IPOs dried up in 1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull
market of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-
ness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the
bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual
total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has
stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-
ing. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through
this manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great IPO boom, back in 1825,
a man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-
lators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-
ers hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by
1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.
* Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already
own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same
proportional interest in the company. This form of financing, still widespread
in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except among closed-end
funds.

142

own  finances.  (When  new  money  is  raised  for  the  business  it
comes  often  via  the  sale  of  preferred  stock,  as  previously  noted.)
This activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of
the security markets must bring many losses and disappointments
to  the  public.  The  dangers  arise  both  from  the  character  of  the
businesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions
that make the financing possible.

In the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading
companies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the
number  of  enterprises  of  first  rank  that  remained  closely  held
steadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have
tended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-
cerns.  By  an  unfortunate  correlation,  during  the  same  period  the
stock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference
for the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor
ones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as
bull  markets  are  built  up;  the  large  and  quick  profits  shown  by
common stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public’s critical
faculty,  just  as  they  sharpen  its  acquisitive  instinct.  During  these
periods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be
found that are enjoying excellent results—although most of these
would not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-
ried back, say, ten years or more.

When these factors are put together the following consequences
emerge:  Somewhere  in  the  middle  of  the  bull  market  the  first 
common-stock  flotations  make  their  appearance.  These  are  priced
not unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of
the early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing
grows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily
poorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One
fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the
fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies
are  offered  at  prices  somewhat  higher  than  the  current  level  for
many  medium-sized  companies  with  a  long  market  history.  (It
should be added that very little of this common-stock financing is
ordinarily done by banking houses of prime size and reputation.)*

* In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally steered
clear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified exploita-

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach

143

The  heedlessness  of  the  public  and  the  willingness  of  selling
organizations  to  sell  whatever  may  be  profitably  sold  can  have
only one result—price collapse. In many cases the new issues lose
75% and more of their offering price. The situation is worsened by
the aforementioned fact that, at bottom, the public has a real aver-
sion to the very kind of small issue that it bought so readily in its
careless  moments.  Many  of  these  issues  fall,  proportionately,  as
much below their true value as they formerly sold above it.

An elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil-
ity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-
stock issues during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found
that can pass severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad pol-
icy to get mixed up in this sort of business. Of course the salesman
will point to many such issues which have had good-sized market
advances—including some that go up spectacularly the very day
they are sold. But all this is part of the speculative atmosphere. It is
easy money. For every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky
if you end up by losing only two.

Some  of  these  issues  may  prove  excellent  buys—a  few  years
later,  when  nobody  wants  them  and  they  can  be  had  at  a  small
fraction of their true worth.

In the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject

as follows:

While the broader aspects of the stock market’s behavior since
1949 have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long expe-
rience,  the  development  of  new  common-stock  flotations  pro-
ceeded  exactly  in  accordance  with  ancient  prescription.  It  is
doubtful whether we ever before had so many new issues offered,
of such low quality, and with such extreme price collapses, as we

tion of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late 1999 and early
2000, however, Wall Street’s biggest investment banks had jumped in with
both  feet.  Venerable  firms  cast  off  their  traditional  prudence  and  behaved
like  drunken  mud  wrestlers,  scrambling  to  foist  ludicrously  overvalued
stocks on a desperately eager public. Graham’s description of how the IPO
process  works  is  a  classic  that  should  be  required  reading  in  investment-
banking ethics classes, if there are any.

experienced  in  1960–1962.4 The  ability  of  the  stock  market  as  a
whole  to  disengage  itself  rapidly  from  that  disaster  is  indeed  an
extraordinary phenomenon, bringing back long-buried memories
of  the  similar  invulnerability  it  showed  to  the  great  Florida  real-
estate collapse in 1925.

Must  there  be  a  return  of  the  new-stock-offering  madness
before  the  present  bull  market  can  come  to  its  definitive  close?
Who knows? But we do know that an intelligent investor will not
forget  what  happened  in  1962  and  will  let  others  make  the  next
batch  of  quick  profits  in  this  area  and  experience  the  consequent
harrowing losses.

We followed these paragraphs in the 1965 edition by citing “A
Horrible Example,” namely, the sale of stock of Aetna Maintenance
Co. at $9 in November 1961. In typical fashion the shares promptly
advanced to $15; the next year they fell to 23⁄8, and in 1964 to 7⁄8. The
later  history  of  this  company  was  on  the  extraordinary  side,  and
illustrates  some  of  the  strange  metamorphoses  that  have  taken
place  in American  business,  great  and  small,  in  recent  years.  The
curious reader will find the older and newer history of this enter-
prise in Appendix 5.

It  is  by  no  means  difficult  to  provide  even  more  harrowing
examples  taken  from  the  more  recent  version  of  “the  same  old
story,” which covered the years 1967–1970. Nothing could be more
pat to our purpose than the case of AAA Enterprises, which hap-
pens to be the first company then listed in Standard & Poor’s Stock
Guide. The shares were sold to the public at $14 in 1968, promptly
advanced  to  28,  but  in  early  1971  were  quoted  at  a  dismal  25¢.
(Even  this  price  represented  a  gross  overvaluation  of  the  enter-
prise, since it had just entered the bankruptcy court in a hopeless
condition.)  There  is  so  much  to  be  learned,  and  such  important
warnings  to  be  gleaned,  from  the  story  of  this  flotation  that  we
have reserved it for detailed treatment below, in Chapter 17.

For the aggressive as well as the defensive investor, what you don’t

do  is  as  important  to  your  success  as  what  you  do.  In  this  chapter,
Graham  lists  his  “don’ts”  for  aggressive  investors.  Here  is  a  list  for

High-yield  bonds—which  Graham  calls  “second-grade”  or  “lower-
grade”  and  today  are  called  “junk  bonds”—get  a  brisk  thumbs-down
from Graham. In his day, it was too costly and cumbersome for an indi-
vidual investor to diversify away the risks of default.1 (To learn how bad
a  default  can  be,  and  how  carelessly  even  “sophisticated”  profes-
sional  bond  investors  can  buy  into  one,  see  the  sidebar  on  p.  146.)
Today, however, more than 130 mutual funds specialize in junk bonds.
These  funds  buy  junk  by  the  cartload;  they  hold  dozens  of  different
bonds.  That  mitigates  Graham’s  complaints  about  the  difficulty  of
diversifying.  (However, his  bias  against  high-yield  preferred  stock
remains valid, since there remains no cheap and widely available way
to spread their risks.)

Since  1978,  an  annual  average  of  4.4%  of  the  junk-bond  market
has gone into default—but, even after those defaults, junk bonds have

1 In  the  early  1970s,  when  Graham  wrote,  there  were  fewer  than  a  dozen
junk-bond  funds,  nearly  all  of  which  charged  sales  commissions  of  up  to
8.5%; some even made investors pay a fee for the privilege of reinvesting
their monthly dividends back into the fund.

Buying a bond only for its yield is like getting married only for the
sex.  If  the  thing  that  attracted  you  in  the  first  place  dries  up,
you’ll  find  yourself  asking,  “What  else  is  there?”  When  the
answer is “Nothing,” spouses and bondholders alike end up with
broken hearts.

On  May  9,  2001,  WorldCom,  Inc.  sold  the  biggest  offering 
of bonds in U.S. corporate history—$11.9 billion worth. Among
the  eager  beavers  attracted  by  the  yields  of  up  to  8.3%  were
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the
world’s largest pension funds; Retirement Systems of Alabama,
whose  managers  later  explained  that  “the  higher  yields”  were
“very attractive to us at the time they were purchased”; and the
Strong Corporate Bond Fund, whose comanager was so fond
of  WorldCom’s  fat  yield  that  he  boasted,  “we’re  getting  paid
more than enough extra income for the risk.” 1

But even a 30-second glance at WorldCom’s bond prospec-
tus would have shown that these bonds had nothing to offer but
their  yield—and  everything  to  lose.  In  two  of  the  previous  five
years WorldCom’s pretax income (the company’s profits before
it paid its dues to the IRS) fell short of covering its fixed charges
(the  costs  of  paying  interest  to  its  bondholders)  by  a  stupen-
dous $4.1 billion. WorldCom could cover those bond payments
only by borrowing more money from banks. And now, with this
mountainous  new  helping  of  bonds,  WorldCom  was  fattening
its  interest  costs  by  another  $900  million  per  year!2 Like  Mr.
Creosote  in  Monty  Python’s  The  Meaning  of  Life, WorldCom
was gorging itself to the bursting point.

No yield could ever be high enough to compensate an investor
for risking that kind of explosion. The WorldCom bonds did pro-
duce fat yields of up to 8% for a few months. Then, as Graham
would have predicted, the yield suddenly offered no shelter:

• WorldCom filed bankruptcy in July 2002.
• WorldCom  admitted  in  August  2002  that  it  had  overstated

its earnings by more than $7 billion.3

• WorldCom’s  bonds  defaulted  when  the  company  could  no
longer cover their interest charges; the bonds lost more than
80% of their original value.

still produced an annualized return of 10.5%, versus 8.6% for 10-year
U.S.  Treasury  bonds.2 Unfortunately,  most  junk-bond  funds charge
high fees and do a poor job of preserving the original principal amount
of your investment. A junk fund could be appropriate if you are retired,
are looking for extra monthly income to supplement your pension, and
can tolerate temporary tumbles in value. If you work at a bank or other
financial company, a sharp rise in interest rates could limit your raise or
even threaten your job security—so a junk fund, which tends to outper-
form  most  other  bond  funds  when  interest  rates  rise,  might  make
sense as a counterweight in your 401(k). A junk-bond fund, though, is
only a minor option—not an obligation—for the intelligent investor.

Graham considered foreign bonds no better a bet than junk bonds.3
Today, however, one variety of foreign bond may have some appeal for
investors  who  can  withstand  plenty  of  risk.  Roughly  a  dozen  mutual
funds specialize in bonds issued in emerging-market nations (or what
used to be called “Third World countries”) like Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russia, and Venezuela. No sane investor would put more than 10% of
a  total  bond  portfolio  in  spicy  holdings  like  these.  But  emerging-
markets bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock market,
so they are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely
because the Dow is down. That can give you a small corner of comfort
in your portfolio just when you may need it most.4

As we’ve already seen in Chapter 1, day trading—holding stocks for a
few hours at a time—is one of the best weapons ever invented for com-
mitting financial suicide. Some of your trades might make money, most
of  your  trades  will  lose  money,  but  your  broker  will  always  make
money.

And  your  own  eagerness  to  buy  or  sell  a  stock  can  lower  your
return. Someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up
having to bid 10 cents higher than the most recent share price before
any sellers will be willing to part with it. That extra cost, called “market
impact,” never shows up on your brokerage statement, but it’s real. If
you’re overeager to buy 1,000 shares of a stock and you drive its price

3 Graham did not criticize foreign bonds lightly, since he spent several years
early in his career acting as a New York–based bond agent for borrowers in
Japan.
4 Two  low-cost,  well-run  emerging-markets  bond  funds  are  Fidelity  New 
Markets  Income  Fund  and  T.  Rowe  Price  Emerging  Markets  Bond  Fund; 
for more information, see www.fidelity.com, www.troweprice.com, and www.
morningstar.com. Do not buy any emerging-markets bond fund with annual
operating  expenses  higher  than  1.25%,  and  be  forewarned  that  some  of
these funds charge short-term redemption fees to discourage investors from
holding them for less than three months.

up by just five cents, you’ve just cost yourself an invisible but very real
$50. On the flip side, when panicky investors are frantic to sell a stock
and  they  dump  it  for  less  than  the  most  recent  price,  market  impact
hits home again.

The costs of trading wear away your returns like so many swipes of
sandpaper. Buying or selling a hot little stock can cost 2% to 4% (or
4%  to  8%  for  a  “round-trip”  buy-and-sell  transaction).5 If  you  put
$1,000  into  a  stock,  your  trading  costs  could  eat  up  roughly  $40
before  you  even  get  started.  Sell  the  stock,  and  you  could  fork  over
another 4% in trading expenses.

Oh, yes—there’s one other thing. When you trade instead of invest,
you  turn  long-term  gains  (taxed  at  a  maximum  capital-gains  rate  of
20%) into ordinary income (taxed at a maximum rate of 38.6%).

Add it all up, and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10% just to
break even on buying and selling a stock.6 Anyone can do that once,
by luck alone. To do it often enough to justify the obsessive attention it
requires—plus the nightmarish stress it generates—is impossible.

Thousands  of  people  have  tried,  and  the  evidence  is  clear:  The

more you trade, the less you keep.

Finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the Univer-
sity  of  California  examined  the  trading  records  of  more  than  66,000
customers  of  a  major  discount  brokerage  firm.  From  1991  through
1996,  these  clients  made  more  than  1.9  million  trades.  Before  the
costs of trading sandpapered away at their returns, the people in the
study actually outperformed the market by an average of at least half a
percentage point per year. But after trading costs, the most active of
these traders—who shifted more than 20% of their stock holdings per

5 The  definitive  source  on  brokerage  costs  is  the  Plexus  Group  of  Santa
Monica,  California,  and  its  website,  www.plexusgroup.com.  Plexus  argues
persuasively  that,  just  as  most  of  the  mass  of  an  iceberg  lies  below  the
ocean  surface,  the  bulk  of  brokerage  costs  are  invisible—misleading
investors  into  believing  that  their  trading  costs  are  insignificant  if  commis-
sion costs are low. The costs of trading NASDAQ stocks are considerably
higher  for  individuals  than  the  costs  of  trading  NYSE-listed  stocks  (see 
p. 128, footnote 5).

month—went  from  beating  the  market  to  underperforming  it  by  an
abysmal 6.4 percentage points per year. The most patient investors,
however—who  traded  a  minuscule  0.2%  of  their  total  holdings  in 
an  average  month—managed  to  outperform  the  market  by  a  whisker,
even  after  their  trading  costs.  Instead  of  giving  a  huge  hunk  of  their
gains  away  to  their  brokers  and  the  IRS,  they  got  to  keep  almost
everything.7 For a look at these results, see Figure 6-1.

The lesson is clear: Don’t just do something, stand there. It’s time
for  everyone  to  acknowledge  that  the  term  “long-term  investor”  is
redundant.  A  long-term  investor  is  the  only  kind  of  investor  there  is.
Someone who can’t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a
time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.

Among the get-rich-quick toxins that poisoned the mind of the invest-
ing public in the 1990s, one of the most lethal was the idea that you
can build wealth by buying IPOs. An IPO is an “initial public offering,”
or  the  first  sale  of  a  company’s  stock  to  the  public.  At  first  blush,
investing  in  IPOs  sounds  like  a  great  idea—after  all,  if  you’d  bought
100 shares of Microsoft when it went public on March 13, 1986, your
$2,100  investment  would  have  grown  to  $720,000  by  early  2003.8
And  finance  professors  Jay  Ritter  and  William  Schwert  have  shown
that if you had spread a total of only $1,000 across every IPO in Janu-
ary  1960,  at  its  offering  price,  sold  out  at  the  end  of  that  month, 
then  invested  anew  in  each  successive  month’s  crop  of  IPOs,  your
portfolio  would  have  been  worth  more  than  $533  decillion  by  year-
end 2001.

(On the printed page, that looks like this:
$533,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.)

edu/odean/Current%20Research.htm  and  http://faculty.gsm.ucdavis.edu/

found virtually identical results among professional money managers—so this
is not a problem limited to “naïve” individuals.

Unfortunately, for every IPO like Microsoft that turns out to be a big
winner, there are thousands of losers. The psychologists Daniel Kahn-
erman and Amos Tversky have shown when humans estimate the like-
lihood or frequency of an event, we make that judgment based not on
how often the event has actually occurred, but on how vivid the past
examples  are.  We  all  want  to  buy  “the  next  Microsoft”—precisely
because we know we missed buying the first Microsoft. But we con-
veniently overlook the fact that most other IPOs were terrible invest-
ments.  You  could  have  earned  that  $533  decillion  gain  only  if  you
never missed a single one of the IPO market’s rare winners—a practi-

cal impossibility. Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured
by  members  of  an  exclusive  private  club—the  big  investment  banks
and fund houses that get shares at the initial (or “underwriting”) price,
before  the  stock  begins  public  trading.  The  biggest  “run-ups”  often
occur  in  stocks  so  small  that  even  many  big  investors  can’t  get  any
shares; there just aren’t enough to go around.

If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after
their  shares  have  rocketed  above  the  exclusive  initial  price,  your
results  will  be  terrible.  From  1980  through  2001,  if  you  had  bought
the average IPO at its first public closing price and held on for three
years,  you  would  have  underperformed  the  market  by  more  than  23
percentage points annually.9

Perhaps  no  stock  personifies  the  pipe  dream  of  getting  rich  from
IPOs better than VA Linux. “LNUX THE NEXT MSFT,” exulted an early
owner; “BUY NOW, AND RETIRE IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.” 10
On December 9, 1999, the stock was placed at an initial public offer-
ing  price  of  $30.  But  demand  for  the  shares  was  so  ferocious  that
when NASDAQ opened that morning, none of the initial owners of VA
Linux  would  let  go  of  any  shares  until  the  price  hit  $299.  The  stock
peaked at $320 and closed at $239.25, a gain of 697.5% in a single
day. But that gain was earned by only a handful of institutional traders;
individual investors were almost entirely frozen out.

More important, buying IPOs is a bad idea because it flagrantly vio-
lates one of Graham’s most fundamental rules: No matter how many
other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if the stock is a
cheap way to own a desirable business. At the peak price on day one,
investors  were  valuing  VA  Linux’s  shares  at  a  total  of  $12.7  billion.
What  was  the  company’s  business  worth?  Less  than  five  years  old,
VA Linux had sold a cumulative total of $44 million worth of its soft-
ware and services—but had lost $25 million in the process. In its most
recent fiscal quarter, VA Linux had generated $15 million in sales but

had lost $10 million on them. This business, then, was losing almost
70 cents on every dollar it took in. VA Linux’s accumulated deficit (the
amount  by  which  its  total  expenses  had  exceeded  its  income)  was
$30 million.

If  VA  Linux  were  a  private  company  owned  by  the  guy  who  lives
next  door,  and  he  leaned  over  the  picket  fence  and  asked  you  how
much you would pay to take his struggling little business off his hands,
would you answer, “Oh, $12.7 billion sounds about right to me”? Or
would you, instead, smile politely, turn back to your barbecue grill, and
wonder  what  on  earth  your  neighbor  had  been  smoking?  Relying
exclusively on our own judgment, none of us would be caught dead
agreeing to pay nearly $13 billion for a money-loser that was already
$30 million in the hole.

But when we’re in public instead of in private, when valuation sud-
denly becomes a popularity contest, the price of a stock seems more
important  than  the  value  of  the  business  it  represents.  As  long  as
someone else will pay even more than you did for a stock, why does it
matter what the business is worth?
This chart shows why it matters.

After  going  up  like  a  bottle  rocket  on  that  first  day  of  trading,  VA
Linux came down like a buttered brick. By December 9, 2002, three
years to the day after the stock was at $239.50, VA Linux closed at
$1.19 per share.

Weighing  the  evidence  objectively,  the  intelligent  investor  should
conclude that IPO does not stand only for “initial public offering.” More
accurately, it is also shorthand for:

Idiotic, Preposterous, and Outrageous.

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising

Investor: The Positive Side

The enterprising investor, by definition, will devote a fair amount
of his attention and efforts toward obtaining a better than run-of-
the-mill investment result. In our discussion of general investment
policy we have made some suggestions regarding bond investments
that are addressed chiefly to the enterprising investor. He might be
interested in special opportunities of the following kinds:

(1) Tax-free New Housing Authority bonds effectively guaranteed

by the United States government.

(2) Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds, also guar-

anteed by the United States government.

(3) Tax-free  industrial  bonds  issued  by  municipalities,  but  ser-

viced by lease payments made by strong corporations.

References  have  been  made  to  these  unusual  types  of  bond

issues in Chapter 4.*

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  there  may  be  lower-quality
bonds  obtainable  at  such  low  prices  as  to  constitute  true  bargain
opportunities.  But  these  would  belong  in  the  “special  situation”
area, where no true distinction exists between bonds and common
stocks.†

* As already noted (see p. 96, footnote †), the New Housing Authority and
New Community bonds are no longer issued.
† Today  these  “lower-quality  bonds”  in  the  “special  situation”  area  are
known  as  distressed  or  defaulted  bonds.  When  a  company  is  in  (or

Operations in Common Stocks

The activities specially characteristic of the enterprising investor

in the common-stock field may be classified under four heads:

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
2. Buying carefully chosen “growth stocks”
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into “special situations”

General Market Policy—Formula Timing

We reserve for the next chapter our discussion of the possibili-
ties  and  limitations  of  a  policy  of  entering  the  market  when  it  is
depressed  and  selling  out  in  the  advanced  stages  of  a  boom.  For
many years in the past this bright idea appeared both simple and
feasible, at least from first inspection of a market chart covering its
periodic  fluctuations.  We  have  already  admitted  ruefully  that  the
market’s action in the past 20 years has not lent itself to operations
of this sort on any mathematical basis. The fluctuations that have
taken  place,  while  not  inconsiderable  in  extent,  would  have
required a special talent or “feel” for trading to take advantage of
them. This is something quite different from the intelligence which
we are assuming in our readers, and we must exclude operations
based on such skill from our terms of reference.

The  50–50  plan,  which  we  proposed  to  the  defensive  investor
and described on p. 90, is about the best specific or automatic for-
mula  we  can  recommend  to  all  investors  under  the  conditions  of
1972. But we have retained a broad leeway between the 25% mini-

approaching) bankruptcy, its common stock becomes essentially worthless,
since  U.S.  bankruptcy  law  entitles  bondholders  to  a  much  stronger  legal
claim  than  shareholders.  But  if  the  company  reorganizes  successfully  and
comes  out  of  bankruptcy,  the  bondholders  often  receive  stock  in  the  new
firm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is able
to pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can perform
almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company. In these special
situations, as Graham puts it, “no true distinction exists between bonds and
common stocks.”

mum and the 75% maximum in common stocks, which we allow to
those investors who have strong convictions about either the dan-
ger or the attractiveness of the general market level. Some 20 years
ago it was possible to discuss in great detail a number of clear-cut
formulas for varying the percentage held in common stocks, with
confidence that these plans had practical utility.1 The times seem to
have passed such approaches by, and there would be little point in
trying  to  determine  new  levels  for  buying  and  selling  out  of  the
market patterns since 1949. That is too short a period to furnish any
reliable guide to the future.*

Growth-Stock Approach

Every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that
will  do  better  than  the  average  over  a  period  of  years. A growth
stock  may  be  defined  as  one  that  has  done  this  in  the  past  and 
is expected to do so in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that
the  intelligent  investor  should  concentrate  upon  the  selection  of
growth stocks. Actually the matter is more complicated, as we shall
try to show.

It is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have “out-
performed the averages” in the past. The investor can obtain a list of
50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker.† Why, then, should he
not merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this
group and lo! he has a guaranteed-successful stock portfolio?

* Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he con-
tends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is too
short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his mastery of
mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very
long samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who peddle “time-
tested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their findings on smaller
samples than Graham would ever accept. (Graham often used 50-year peri-
ods to analyze past data.)
† Today, the enterprising investor can assemble such a list over the Internet
by visiting such websites as www.morningstar.com (try the Stock Quickrank
tool),  www.quicken.com/investments/stocks/search/full,  and  http://yahoo.
marketguide.com.

158

The Intelligent Investor

There are two catches to this simple idea. The first is that com-
mon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell
at  correspondingly  high  prices.  The  investor  may  be  right  in  his
judgment  of  their  prospects  and  still  not  fare  particularly  well,
merely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the
expected  prosperity.  The  second  is  that  his  judgment  as  to  the
future may prove wrong. Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up
forever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expan-
sion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement
more difficult. At some point the growth curve flattens out, and in
many cases it turns downward.

It  is  obvious  that  if  one  confines  himself  to  a  few  chosen
instances, based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes
can readily be either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How
can one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here? We think
that  reasonably  sound  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  a  study  of
the  results  achieved  by  the  investment  funds  specializing  in  the
growth-stock  approach.  The  authoritative  manual  entitled  Invest-
ment  Companies, published  annually  by  Arthur  Wiesenberger  &
Company,  members  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  computes
the annual performance of some 120 such “growth funds” over a
period  of  years.  Of  these,  45  have  records  covering  ten  years  or
more. The average overall gain for these companies—unweighted
for  size  of  fund—works  out  at  108%  for  the  decade  1961–1970,
compared  with  105%  for  the  S  &  P composite  and  83%  for  the
DJIA.3 In  the  two  years  1969  and  1970  the  majority  of  the  126
“growth funds” did worse than either index. Similar results were
found  in  our  earlier  studies.  The  implication  here  is  that  no  out-
standing  rewards  came  from  diversified  investment  in  growth
companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.*

* Over  the  10  years  ending  December  31,  2002,  funds  investing  in  large
growth  companies—today’s  equivalent  of  what  Graham  calls  “growth
funds”—earned  an  annual  average  of  5.6%,  underperforming  the  overall
stock  market  by  an  average  of  3.7  percentage  points  per  year.  However,
“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies also
underperformed the market over the same period (by a full percentage point
per  year).  Is  the  problem  merely  that  growth  funds  cannot  reliably  select

There is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent
investor, even with much devoted effort, can derive better results
over the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the invest-
ment  companies  specializing  in  this  area.  Surely  these  organiza-
tions  have  more  brains  and  better  research  facilities  at  their
disposal than you do. Consequently we should advise against the
usual  type  of  growth-stock  commitment  for  the  enterprising
investor.* This is one in which the excellent prospects are fully rec-
ognized  in  the  market  and  already  reflected  in  a  current  price-
earnings  ratio  of,  say,  higher  than  20.  (For  the  defensive  investor
we suggested an upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average
earnings of the past seven years. The two criteria would be about
equivalent in most cases.)†

stocks  that  will  outperform  the  market  in  the  future?  Or  is  it  that  the  high
costs of running the average fund (whether it buys growth or “value” compa-
nies) exceed any extra return the managers can earn with their stock picks?
To update fund performance by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category
Returns.” For an enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of
different investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_
table/pertable.pdf.
* Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising” investor is
not one who takes more risk than average or who buys “aggressive growth”
stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who is willing to put in extra
time and effort in researching his or her portfolio.
† Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio based
on a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the odds that
you will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily high burst
of profitability. Imagine that a company earned $3 per share over the past
12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six
years. Which number—the sudden $3 or the steady 50 cents—is more likely
to represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the $3 it earned in the most
recent year, the stock would be priced at $75. But at 25 times the average
earnings  of  the  past  seven  years  ($6  in  total  earnings,  divided  by  seven,
equals 85.7 cents per share in average annual earnings), the stock would
be priced at only $21.43. Which number you pick makes a big difference.
Finally,  it’s  worth  noting  that  the  prevailing  method  on  Wall  Street  today—
basing  price/earnings  ratios  primarily  on  “next  year’s  earnings”—would  be

The Intelligent Investor

The  striking  thing  about  growth  stocks  as  a  class  is  their  ten-
dency  toward  wide  swings  in  market  price.  This  is  true  of  the
largest and longest-established companies—such as General Elec-
tric  and  International  Business  Machines—and  even  more  so  of
newer and smaller successful companies. They illustrate our thesis
that the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been
the injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com-
panies which have scored the most brilliant successes, and which
themselves  would  be  entitled  to  a  high  investment  rating.  (Their
credit standing is of the best, and they pay the lowest interest rates
on  their  borrowings.)  The  investment  caliber  of  such  a  company
may not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteris-
tics of its stock will depend on what happens to it in the stock mar-
ket. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and the faster
its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the
riskier a proposition it becomes.*

But is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes
from  common  stocks  have  been  garnered  by  those  who  made  a
substantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose
future  they  had  great  confidence,  and  who  held  their  original
shares  unwaveringly  while  they  increased  100-fold  or  more  in
value?  The  answer  is  “Yes.”  But  the  big  fortunes  from  single-
company investments are almost always realized by persons who

anathema to Graham. How can you value a company based on earnings it
hasn’t  even  generated  yet?  That’s  like  setting  house  prices  based  on  a
rumor that Cinderella will be building her new castle right around the corner.
* Recent  examples  hammer  Graham’s  point  home.  On  September  21,
2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it expected
its  revenues  to  grow  by  up  to  5%  in  the  next  quarter.  At  first  blush,  that
sounds  great;  most  big  companies  would  be  delighted  to  increase  their
sales  by  5%  in  just  three  months.  But  in  response,  Intel’s  stock  dropped
22%, a one-day loss of nearly $91 billion in total value. Why? Wall Street’s
analysts  had  expected  Intel’s  revenue  to  rise  by  up  to  10%.  Similarly,  on
February  21,  2001,  EMC  Corp.,  a  data-storage  firm,  announced  that  it
expected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in 2001—but that a new cau-
tion among customers “may lead to longer selling cycles.” On that whiff of
hesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their value in a single day.

have  a  close  relationship  with  the  particular  company—through
employment, family connection, etc.—which justifies them in plac-
ing a large part of their resources in one medium and holding on 
to  this  commitment  through  all  vicissitudes,  despite  numerous
temptations  to  sell  out  at  apparently  high  prices  along  the  way. 
An  investor  without  such  close  personal  contact  will  constantly 
be  faced  with  the  question  of  whether  too  large  a  portion  of 
his funds are in this one medium.* Each decline—however tempo-
rary  it  proves  in  the  sequel—will  accentuate  his  problem;  and
internal and external pressures are likely to force him to take what
seems  to  be  a  goodly  profit,  but  one  far  less  than  the  ultimate
bonanza.4

Three Recommended Fields for “Enterprising Investment”

To obtain better than average investment results over a long pull
requires  a  policy  of  selection  or  operation  possessing  a  twofold
merit:  (1)  It  must  meet  objective  or  rational  tests  of  underlying
soundness; and (2) it must be different from the policy followed by
most investors or speculators. Our experience and study leads us
to recommend three investment approaches that meet these crite-
ria.  They  differ  rather  widely  from  one  another,  and  each  may
require a different type of knowledge and temperament on the part
of those who assay it.

* Today’s equivalent of investors “who have a close relationship with the par-
ticular  company”  are  so-called  control  persons—senior  managers  or  direc-
tors who help run the company and own huge blocks of stock. Executives
like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway have
direct control over a company’s destiny—and outside investors want to see
these chief executives maintain their large shareholdings as a vote of confi-
dence. But less-senior managers and rank-and-file workers cannot influence
the company’s share price with their individual decisions; thus they should
not put more than a small percentage of their assets in their own employer’s
stock. As for outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the
company, the same objection applies.

The Relatively Unpopular Large Company

If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com-
mon  stocks  which  have  been  showing  excellent  growth  or  are
glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will
undervalue—relatively,  at  least—companies  that  are  out  of  favor
because  of  unsatisfactory  developments  of  a  temporary  nature.
This may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market,
and  it  suggests  an  investment  approach  that  should  prove  both
conservative and promising.

The  key  requirement  here  is  that  the  enterprising  investor 
concentrate  on  the  larger  companies  that  are  going  through  a
period  of  unpopularity.  While  small  companies  may  also  be 
undervalued  for  similar  reasons,  and  in  many  cases  may  later
increase  their  earnings  and  share  price,  they  entail  the  risk  of  a
definitive  loss  of  profitability  and  also  of  protracted  neglect  by 
the  market  in  spite  of  better  earnings.  The  large  companies  thus
have  a  double  advantage  over  the  others.  First,  they  have  the
resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-
sity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is
likely  to  respond  with  reasonable  speed  to  any  improvement
shown.

A remarkable  demonstration  of  the  soundness  of  this  thesis  is
found  in  studies  of  the  price  behavior  of  the  unpopular  issues  in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an
investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues 
in  the  DJIA which  were  selling  at  the  lowest  multipliers  of  their
current  or  previous  year’s  earnings.  These  could  be  called  the
“cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the
reflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was
assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of
holding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these
investments were then compared with the results shown in either
the DJIA as a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-
ular) group.

The  detailed  material  we  have  available  covers  the  results  of
annual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5 In the early
period,  1917–1933,  this  approach  proved  unprofitable.  But  since
1933  the  method  has  shown  highly  successful  results.  In  34  tests

made by Drexel & Company (now Drexel Firestone)* of one-year
holding—from 1937 through 1969—the cheap stocks did definitely
worse than the DJIA in only three instances; the results were about
the  same  in  six  cases;  and  the  cheap  stocks  clearly  outperformed
the average in 25 years. The consistently better performance of the
low-multiplier  stocks  is  shown  (Table  7-2)  by  the  average  results
for successive five-year periods, when compared with those of the
DJIA and of the ten high-multipliers.

The  Drexel  computation  shows  further  that  an  original  invest-
ment  of  $10,000  made  in  the  low-multiplier  issues  in  1936,  and
switched  each  year  in  accordance  with  the  principle,  would  have
grown to $66,900 by 1962. The same operations in high-multiplier
stocks  would  have  ended  with  a  value  of  only  $25,300;  while  an
operation  in  all  thirty  stocks  would  have  increased  the  original
fund to $44,000.†

execution on a group basis, as described above, are both quite sim-
ple.  But  in  considering  individual  companies  a  special  factor  of
opposite import must sometimes to be taken into account. Compa-
nies  that  are  inherently  speculative  because  of  widely  varying
earnings  tend  to  sell  both  at  a  relatively  high  price  and  at  a  rela-
tively  low  multiplier  in  their  good  years,  and  conversely  at  low
prices and high multipliers in their bad years. These relationships
are illustrated in Table 7-3, covering fluctuations of Chrysler Corp.
common. In these cases the market has sufficient skepticism as to
the continuation of the unusually high profits to value them con-
servatively, and conversely when earnings are low or nonexistent.
(Note that, by the arithmetic, if a company earns “next to nothing”
its shares must sell at a high multiplier of these minuscule profits.)
As  it  happens  Chrysler  has  been  quite  exceptional  in  the  DJIA
list of leading companies, and hence it did not greatly affect the the
low-multiplier calculations. It would be quite easy to avoid inclu-
sion of such anomalous issues in a low-multiplier list by requiring
also that the price be low in relation to past average earnings or by
some similar test.

While  writing  this  revision  we  tested  the  results  of  the  DJIA-
low-multiplier method applied to a group assumed to be bought at

the end of 1968 and revalued on June 30, 1971. This time the figures
proved  quite  disappointing,  showing  a  sharp  loss  for  the  low-
multiplier six or ten and a good profit for the high-multiplier selec-
tions.  This  one  bad  instance  should  not  vitiate  conclusions  based
on 30-odd experiments, but its recent happening gives it a special
adverse weight. Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with
the “low-multiplier” idea, but add other quantitative and qualita-
tive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.

Purchase of Bargain Issues

We define  a  bargain  issue  as  one  which,  on  the  basis  of  facts
established  by  analysis,  appears  to  be  worth  considerably  more
than it is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks
selling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete
as  possible,  let  us  suggest  that  an  issue  is  not  a  true  “bargain”
unless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What
kind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-
ancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does
the investor profit from them?

There  are  two  tests  by  which  a  bargain  common  stock  is
detected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely
on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-
tor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-
ciently above the market price—and if the investor has confidence
in the technique employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The
second  test  is  the  value  of  the  business  to  a  private  owner.  This
value  also  is  often  determined  chiefly  by  expected  future  earn-
ings—in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in
the second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable
value  of  the  assets, with  particular  emphasis  on  the  net  current
assets or working capital.

At low points in the general market a large proportion of com-
mon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A
typical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in
1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning
in excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.) It is true
that  current  earnings  and  the  immediate  prospects  may  both  be
poor,  but  a  levelheaded  appraisal  of  average  future  conditions

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

167

would indicate values far above ruling prices. Thus the wisdom of
having courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the
voice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques
of value analysis.

The same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish
a bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of
many individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is
fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-
nary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest
or  enthusiasm  may  impel  a  price  decline  to  absurdly  low  levels.
Thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-
tion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect
or unpopularity.

However,  neither  of  these  causes,  if  considered  by  itself  alone,
can be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.
How  can  we  be  sure  that  the  currently  disappointing  results  are
indeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent
examples  of  that  happening.  The  steel  stocks  used  to  be  famous 
for  their  cyclical  quality,  and  the  shrewd  buyer  could  acquire 
them  at  low  prices  when  earnings  were  low  and  sell  them  out  in
boom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by
Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.

If  this  were  the  standard behavior  of  stocks  with  fluctuating
earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy
matter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in

* Among  the  steepest  of  the  mountains  recently  made  out  of  molehills: 
In  May  1998,  Pfizer  Inc.  and  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration
announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence drug Viagra had died
of  heart  attacks  while  having  sex.  Pfizer’s  stock  immediately  went  flaccid,
losing  3.4%  in  a  single  day  on  heavy  trading.  But  Pfizer’s  shares  surged
ahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the
stock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997, shares of
Warner-Lambert  Co.  fell  by  19%  in  a  day  when  sales  of  its  new  diabetes
drug  were  temporarily  halted  in  England;  within  six  months,  the  stock  had
nearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,
lost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea
and vomiting—on ships run by other companies.

168

earnings  and  price  which  were  not  followed  automatically  by  a
handsome  recovery  of  both.  One  such  was  Anaconda  Wire  and
Cable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85
in  that  year.  The  earnings  then  declined  irregularly  for  six  years;
the  price  fell  to  231⁄2 in  1962,  and  the  following  year  it  was  taken
over by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equiv-
alent of only 33.

The  many  experiences  of  this  type  suggest  that  the  investor
would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price
to give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indi-
cation  of  at  least  reasonable  stability  of  earnings  over  the  past
decade  or  more—i.e.,  no  year  of  earnings  deficit—plus  sufficient
size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.
The  ideal  combination  here  is  thus  that  of  a  large  and  prominent
company selling both well below its past average price and its past
average  price/earnings  multiplier.  This  would  no  doubt  have
ruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as
Chrysler, since their low-price years are generally accompanied by
high price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader now—and
no doubt we shall do it again—that there is a world of difference
between  “hindsight  profits”  and  “real-money  profits.”  We  doubt
seriously  whether  the  Chrysler  type  of  roller  coaster  is  a  suitable
medium for operations by our enterprising investor.

We have mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec-
ond cause of price declines to unduly low levels. A current case of
this kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull
market of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the
$5.61 earnings for that year. The per-share profits increased in both
1969 and 1970, but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was
less than 4 times the (record) earnings in that year and less than its
net-current-asset value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only
51⁄2 times the last reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-
current-asset value.

Another example of this type is provided currently by Standard
Oil  of  California,  a  concern  of  major  importance.  In  early  1972  it
was selling at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its
earnings had been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth
but  with  only  one  small  decline  over  the  entire  period.  Its  book
value was about equal to the market price. With this conservatively

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

169

favorable  1958–71  record  the  company  has  never  shown  an  aver-
age annual price as high as 15 times its current earnings. In early
1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about 10.

A third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may
be the market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our
classic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946–47
declined from 36 to 131⁄2. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were
close  to  $10  per  share.  The  price  of  the  stock  was  held  down  in
great part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of
its earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar
to railroads.

The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a
common stock that sells for less than the company’s net working
capital  alone,  after  deducting  all  prior  obligations.*  This  would
mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets—
buildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.
Very  few  companies  turn  out  to  have  an  ultimate  value  less  than
the  working  capital  alone,  although  scattered  instances  may  be
found. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many
enterprises  obtainable  which  have  been  valued  in  the  market  on
this bargain basis. A compilation made in 1957, when the market’s
level was by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common
stocks. In Table 7-4 we summarize the result of buying, on Decem-
ber 31, 1957, one share of each of the 85 companies in that list for
which  data  appeared  in  Standard  &  Poor’s  Monthly  Stock  Guide,
and holding them for two years.

By something of a coincidence, each of the groups advanced in
the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate
net-current-asset  value.  The  gain  for  the  entire  “portfolio”  in  that
period was 75%, against 50% for Standard & Poor’s 425 industrials.
What is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed signifi-
cant  losses,  seven  held  about  even,  and  78  showed  appreciable
gains.

Our  experience  with  this  type  of  investment  selection—on  a

diversified  basis—was  uniformly  good  for  many  years  prior  to
1957. It can probably be affirmed without hesitation that it consti-
tutes  a  safe  and  profitable  method  of  determining  and  taking
advantage of undervalued situations. However, during the general
market  advance  after  1957  the  number  of  such  opportunities
became extremely limited, and many of those available were show-
ing  small  operating  profits  or  even  losses.  The  market  decline  of
1969–70  produced  a  new  crop  of  these  “sub-working-capital”
stocks. We discuss this group in Chapter 15, on stock selection for
the enterprising investor.

Bargain-Issue  Pattern  in  Secondary  Companies. We  have
defined a secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly
important industry. Thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns
in its field, but it may equally well be the chief unit in an unimpor-
tant  line.  By  way  of  exception,  any  company  that  has  established
itself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered “secondary.”

In the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction
was drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues, pro-
vided  the  latter  were  of  respectable  size.  The  public  felt  that  a 
middle-sized company was strong enough to weather storms and
that it had a better chance for really spectacular expansion than one
that  was  already  of  major  dimensions.  The  depression  years
1931–32,  however,  had  a  particularly  devastating  impact  on  the
companies below the first rank either in size or in inherent stability.
As a result of that experience investors have since developed a pro-

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

171

nounced preference for industry leaders and a corresponding lack
of interest most of the time in the ordinary company of secondary
importance. This has meant that the latter group have usually sold
at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have
the  former.  It  has  meant  further  that  in  many  instances  the  price
has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.

When  investors  rejected  the  stocks  of  secondary  companies,
even though these sold at relatively low prices, they were express-
ing  a  belief  or  fear  that  such  companies  faced  a  dismal  future.  In
fact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that any price was too
high for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in
1929 the companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price
was too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-
less. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive
of  serious  investment  errors.  Actually,  the  typical  middle-sized
listed company is a large one when compared with the average pri-
vately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-
nies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the
vicissitudes  characteristic  of  our  economy  but  earning  on  the
whole a fair return on their invested capital.

This  brief  review  indicates  that  the  stock  market’s  attitude
toward  secondary  companies  tends  to  be  unrealistic  and  conse-
quently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major
undervaluation.  As  it  happens,  the  World  War  II  period  and  the
postwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to
the larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was
suspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins
more  spectacularly.  Thus  by  1946  the  market’s  pattern  had  com-
pletely reversed itself from that before the war. Whereas the lead-
ing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only
40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard & Poor’s index
of  low-priced  stocks  had  shot  up  no  less  than  280%  in  the  same
period.  Speculators  and  many  self-styled  investors—with  the
proverbial  short  memories  of  people  in  the  stock  market—were
eager to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at
inflated levels. Thus the pendulum had swung clear to the oppo-
site extreme. The very class of secondary issues that had formerly
supplied by far the largest proportion of bargain opportunities was
now  presenting  the  greatest  number  of  examples  of  overenthusi-

172

The Intelligent Investor

asm  and  overvaluation.  In  a  different  way  this  phenomenon  was
repeated  in  1961  and  1968—the  emphasis  now  being  placed  on
new offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-
ary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields
such as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns, and oth-
ers.*

As  was  to  be  expected  the  ensuing  market  declines  fell  most
heavily  on  these  overvaluations.  In  some  cases  the  pendulum
swing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.

If most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what
reason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-
uation?  For  if  it  persists  indefinitely,  will  he  not  always  be  in  the
same  market  position  as  when  he  bought  the  issue?  The  answer
here  is  somewhat  complicated.  Substantial  profits  from  the  pur-
chase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of
ways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-
vested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will
ultimately  affect  the  price.  In  a  five-  to  seven-year  period  these
advantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull
market  is  ordinarily  most  generous  to  low-priced  issues;  thus  it
tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.
Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-
uous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary
issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level
for  their  type  of  security.  Fifth,  the  specific  factors  that  in  many

* From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed large
stocks  by  an  amazing  average  of  17.6  percentage  points  per  year.  The
investing  public  eagerly  embraced  small  stocks,  mutual  fund  companies
rolled  out  hundreds  of  new  funds  specializing  in  them,  and  small  stocks
obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage points per year
over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when small stocks beat
big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring investment bankers to
sell  hundreds  of  hot  little  high-tech  stocks  to  the  public  for  the  first  time.
Instead of “electronics,” “computers,” or “franchise” in their names, the new
buzzwords were “.com,” “optical,” “wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and
“I-.”  Investing  buzzwords  always  turn  into  buzz  saws,  tearing  apart  anyone
who believes in them.

173

cases  made  for  a  disappointing  record  of  earnings  may  be  cor-
rected  by  the  advent  of  new  conditions,  or  the  adoption  of  new
policies, or by a change in management.

An important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition
of smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversifi-
cation  program.  In  these  cases  the  consideration  paid  has  almost
always been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain
levels existing not long before.

When interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of
bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at
large discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have
a different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large
discounts  if  carrying  coupon  rates  of,  say,  41⁄2%  or  less.  Example:
American Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄8s, due 1986, sold as low as 51
in 1970; Deere & Co. 41⁄2s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may
well  turn  out  to  have  been  bargain  opportunities  before  very
long—if  ruling  interest  rates  should  decline  substantially.  For  a
bargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall
have  to  turn  once  more  to  the  first-mortgage  bonds  of  railroads
now in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-
tions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values
in this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-
dency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently
the  group  as  a  whole  offers  an  especially  rewarding  invitation  to
careful and courageous analysis. In the decade ending in 1948 the
billion-dollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer-
ous and spectacular opportunities in this area. Such opportunities
have been quite scarce since then; but they seem likely to return in
the 1970s.*

* Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today. How-
ever, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds, as well as con-
vertible  bonds  issued  by  high-tech  companies,  may  offer  real  value  in  the
wake  of  the  2000–2002  market  crash.  But  diversification  in  this  area  is
essential—and  impractical  without  at  least  $100,000  to  dedicate  to  dis-
tressed securities alone. Unless you are a millionaire several times over, this
kind of diversification is not an option.

Special Situations, or “Workouts”

Not so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee
an attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in
it; and this was true under almost any sort of general market situa-
tion. It was not actually forbidden territory to members of the gen-
eral public. Some who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn
the  ropes  and  become  pretty  capable  practitioners  without  the
necessity  of  long  academic  study  or  apprenticeship.  Others  have
been  keen  enough  to  recognize  the  underlying  soundness  of  this
approach  and  to  attach  themselves  to  bright  young  men  who 
handled  funds  devoted  chiefly  to  these  “special  situations.”  But 
in recent years, for reasons we shall develop later, the field of “arbi-
trages  and  workouts”  became  riskier  and  less  profitable.  It  may 
be that in years to come conditions in this field will become more
propitious.  In  any  case  it  is  worthwhile  outlining  the  general
nature and origin of these operations, with one or two illustrative
examples.

The typical “special situation” has grown out of the increasing
number of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones, as the gospel
of diversification of products has been adopted by more and more
managements.  It  often  appears  good  business  for  such  an  enter-
prise to acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter
rather than to start a new venture from scratch. In order to make
such acquisition possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by
the required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company,
it  is  almost  always  necessary  to  offer  a  price  considerably  above 
the current level. Such corporate moves have been producing inter-
esting  profit-making  opportunities  for  those  who  have  made  a
study  of  this  field,  and  have  good  judgment  fortified  by  ample
experience.

A great  deal  of  money  was  made  by  shrewd  investors  not  so
many  years  ago  through  the  purchase  of  bonds  of  railroads  in
bankruptcy—bonds which they knew would be worth much more
than their cost when the railroads were finally reorganized. After
promulgation of the plans of reorganization a “when issued” mar-
ket for the new securities appeared. These could almost always be
sold  for  considerably  more  than  the  cost  of  the  old  issues  which
were to be exchanged therefor. There were risks of nonconsumma-

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

175

tion  of  the  plans  or  of  unexpected  delays,  but  on  the  whole  such
“arbitrage operations” proved highly profitable.

There were similar opportunities growing out of the breakup of
public-utility  holding  companies  pursuant  to  1935  legislation.
Nearly all these enterprises proved to be worth considerably more
when  changed  from  holding  companies  to  a  group  of  separate
operating companies.

The underlying factor here is the tendency of the security mar-
kets to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of compli-
cated legal proceedings. An old Wall Street motto has been: “Never
buy  into  a  lawsuit.”  This  may  be  sound  advice  to  the  speculator
seeking quick action on his holdings. But the adoption of this atti-
tude by the general public is bound to create bargain opportunities
in  the  securities  affected  by  it,  since  the  prejudice  against  them
holds their prices down to unduly low levels.*

The  exploitation  of  special  situations  is  a  technical  branch  of
investment  which  requires  a  somewhat  unusual  mentality  and
equipment.  Probably  only  a  small  percentage  of  our  enterprising
investors are likely to engage in it, and this book is not the appro-
priate medium for expounding its complications.6

Broader Implications of Our Rules for Investment

Investment policy, as it has been developed here, depends in the
first place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive (pas-
sive)  or  aggressive  (enterprising)  role.  The  aggressive  investor
must have a considerable knowledge of security values—enough,
in fact, to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to
a  business  enterprise.  There  is  no  room  in  this  philosophy  for  a

* A classic  recent  example  is  Philip  Morris,  whose  stock  lost  23%  in  two
days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive damages of
up to $200 billion against the company—which had finally admitted that cig-
arettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip Morris’s stock had doubled—
only  to  fall  back  after  a  later  multibillion-dollar  judgment  in  Illinois.  Several
other  stocks  have  been  virtually  destroyed  by  liability  lawsuits,  including
Johns Manville, W. R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a law-
suit” remains a valid rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.

176

The Intelligent Investor

middle ground, or a series of gradations, between the passive and
aggressive  status.  Many,  perhaps  most,  investors  seek  to  place
themselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is
a compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than
achievement.

As  an  investor  you  cannot  soundly  become  “half  a  business-
man,” expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business
profits on your funds.

It follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own-
ers should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the
time,  or  the  determination,  or  the  mental  equipment  to  embark
upon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-
fied  with  the  excellent  return  now  obtainable  from  a  defensive
portfolio  (and  with  even  less),  and  they  should  stoutly  resist  the
recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other
paths.

The enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-
rity  operation  for  which  his  training  and  judgment  are  adequate
and  which  appears  sufficiently  promising when  measured  by  estab-
lished business standards.

In our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors
we have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for
the  defensive  investor  we  have  been  guided  largely  by  the  three
requirements of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and prom-
ise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology as well as arith-
metic. The use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field
of recommended investment a number of security classes that are
normally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors. These
prohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p. 30.

Let us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in
these  exclusions.  We  have  advised  against  the  purchase  at  “full
prices”  of  three  important  categories  of  securities:  (1)  foreign
bonds,  (2)  ordinary  preferred  stocks,  and  (3)  secondary  common
stocks,  including,  of  course,  original  offerings  of  such  issues.  By
“full  prices”  we  mean  prices  close  to  par  for  bonds  or  preferred
stocks,  and  prices  that  represent  about  the  fair  business  value  of
the  enterprise  in  the  case  of  common  stocks.  The  greater  number 
of  defensive  investors  are  to  avoid  these  categories  regardless  of
price;  the  enterprising  investor  is  to  buy  them  only  when  obtain-

Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

177

able  at  bargain  prices—which  we  define  as  prices  not  more  than
two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities.

What would happen if all investors were guided by our advice
in  these  matters?  That  question  was  considered  in  regard  to  for-
eign  bonds,  on  p.  138,  and  we  have  nothing  to  add  at  this  point.
Investment-grade preferred stocks would be bought solely by cor-
porations, such as insurance companies, which would benefit from
the special income-tax status of stock issues owned by them.

The most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is
in  the  field  of  secondary  common  stocks.  If  the  majority  of
investors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all,
the field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted. Further-
more, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,
then  these  issues  would  be  doomed  to  sell  for  less  than  their  fair
value,  except  to  the  extent  that  they  were  purchased  unintelli-
gently.

This may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth
we are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area
for the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the
most  part,  do fluctuate  about  a  central  level  which  is  well  below
their fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;
but this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-
sons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of
paying the prevailing prices for common stocks.

Thus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-
nize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they
accept  the  central  market  levels  that  are  normal  for  that  class  as
their guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.

There is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected
secondary  company  may  be  fully  as  promising  as  the  average
industrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-
ity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-
sequently  it  may  appear  illogical  to  many  readers  to  term
“unintelligent” the purchase of such secondary issues at their full
“enterprise value.” We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-
rience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect
satisfactory  results,  on  the  average,  from  secondary  common
stocks  only  if  he  buys  them  for  less  than  their  value  to  a  private
owner, that is, on a bargain basis.

178

The Intelligent Investor

The last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi-
nary outside investor.  Anyone  who  can  control a  secondary  com-
pany, or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully
justified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest-
ing in a “close corporation” or other private business. The distinc-
tion  between  the  position,  and  consequent  investment  policy,  of
insiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise
itself becomes less important. It is a basic characteristic of a primary
or  leading  company  that  a  single  detached  share  is  ordinarily
worth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary com-
panies the average market value of a detached share is substantially
less than its worth to a controlling owner. Because of this fact, the
matter of shareholder-management relations and of those between
inside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important
and controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary
companies.

At the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak-
ing any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary
companies.  The  many  common  stocks  in  the  boundary  area  may
properly  exhibit  an  intermediate  price  behavior.  It  would  not  be
illogical  for  an  investor  to  buy  such  an  issue  at  a  small discount
from its indicated or appraisal value, on the theory that it is only a
small distance away from a primary classification and that it may
acquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.

Thus  the  distinction  between  primary  and  secondary  issues
need not be made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference
in  quality  must  produce  a  large  differential  in  justified  purchase
price. In saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas-
sification of common stocks, although we counseled against such a
middle ground in the classification of investors. Our reason for this
apparent  inconsistency  is  as  follows:  No  great  harm  comes  from
some uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security, because
such  cases  are  exceptional  and  not  a  great  deal  is  at  stake  in  the
matter.  But  the  investor’s  choice  as  between  the  defensive  or  the
aggressive  status  is  of  major  consequence  to  him,  and  he  should
not allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci-
sion.

In an ideal world, the intelligent investor would hold stocks only when
they  are  cheap  and  sell  them  when  they  become  overpriced,  then
duck  into  the  bunker  of  bonds  and  cash  until  stocks  again  become
cheap  enough  to  buy.  From  1966  through  late  2001,  one  study
claimed, $1 held continuously in stocks would have grown to $11.71.
But if you had gotten out of stocks right before the five worst days of
each year, your original $1 would have grown to $987.12.1

Like  most  magical  market  ideas,  this  one  is  based  on  sleight  of
hand. How, exactly, would you (or anyone) figure out which days will
be the worst days—before they arrive? On January 7, 1973, the New
York Times featured an interview with one of the nation’s top financial
forecasters, who urged investors to buy stocks without hesitation: “It’s
very rare that you can be as unqualifiedly bullish as you can now.” That
forecaster was named Alan Greenspan, and it’s very rare that anyone

yourself; many of the quotes that follow are likely to be lies. (For one thing, an

have ended up with at least $40, not $11.71; the study cited in Barron’s ap-

Can  professionals  time  the  market  any  better  than  Alan  Green-

behind  us,”  declared  Kate  Leary  Lee,  president  of  the  market-timing
firm of R. M. Leary & Co., on December 3, 2001. “This is when you
want  to  be  in  the  market,”  she  added,  predicting  that  stocks  “look
good”  for  the  first  quarter  of  2002.3 Over  the  next  three  months,
stocks  earned  a  measly  0.28%  return,  underperforming  cash  by  1.5
percentage points.

Leary is not alone. A study by two finance professors at Duke Univer-
sity found that if you had followed the recommendations of the best 10%
of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annual-
ized return from 1991 through 1995. But if you had ignored them and
kept your money in a stock index fund, you would have earned 16.4%.4
As the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard noted, life can only
be  understood  backwards—but  it  must  be  lived  forwards.  Looking
back, you can always see exactly when you should have bought and
sold your stocks. But don’t let that fool you into thinking you can see,
in real time, just when to get in and out. In the financial markets, hind-
sight is forever 20/20, but foresight is legally blind. And thus, for most
investors, market timing is a practical and emotional impossibility.5

fees (which have not been deducted from the calculations of these newslet-
ters’  returns).  And  brokerage  costs  and  short-term  capital  gains  taxes  are
usually  much  higher  for  market  timers  than  for  buy-and-hold  investors.  For

Like spacecraft that pick up speed as they rise into the Earth’s strato-
sphere, growth stocks often seem to defy gravity. Let’s look at the tra-
jectories of three of the hottest growth stocks of the 1990s: General
Electric, Home Depot, and Sun Microsystems. (See Figure 7-1.)

In every year from 1995 through 1999, each grew bigger and more
profitable. Revenues doubled at Sun and more than doubled at Home
Depot. According to Value Line, GE’s revenues grew 29%; its earnings
rose 65%. At Home Depot and Sun, earnings per share roughly tripled.
But something else was happening—and it wouldn’t have surprised
Graham  one  bit.  The  faster  these  companies  grew,  the  more  expen-
sive their stocks became. And when stocks grow faster than compa-
nies, investors always end up sorry. As Figure 7-2 shows:

A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for

the stock.

The more a stock has gone up, the more it seems likely to keep going
up. But that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental law
of financial physics: The bigger they get, the slower they grow. A $1-
billion company can double its sales fairly easily; but where can a $50-
billion company turn to find another $50 billion in business?

Growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable,
but when their price/earnings ratios go much above 25 or 30 the odds
get ugly:

Journalist Carol Loomis found that, from 1960 through 1999, only
eight of the largest 150 companies on the Fortune 500 list man-
aged to raise their earnings by an annual average of at least 15%
for two decades.6
Looking at five decades of data, the research firm of Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. showed that only 10% of large U.S. companies
had increased their earnings by 20% for at least five consecutive
years; only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 years straight;
and not a single one had done it for 15 years in a row.7

An  academic  study  of  thousands  of  U.S.  stocks  from  1951
through  1998  found  that  over  all  10-year  periods,  net  earnings
grew by an average of 9.7% annually. But for the biggest 20% of
companies, earnings grew by an annual average of just 9.3%.8

Even many corporate leaders fail to understand these odds (see side-
bar on p. 184). The intelligent investor, however, gets interested in big
growth stocks not when they are at their most popular—but when some-
thing  goes  wrong.  In  July  2002,  Johnson  &  Johnson  announced  that
Federal regulators were investigating accusations of false record keep-
ing at one of its drug factories, and the stock lost 16% in a single day.
That took J & J’s share price down from 24 times the previous 12 months’
earnings to just 20 times. At that lower level, Johnson & Johnson might
once again have become a growth stock with room to grow—making it an
example of what Graham calls “the relatively unpopular large company.” 9
This kind of temporary unpopularity can create lasting wealth by enabling
you to buy a great company at a good price.

8 Louis K. C. Chan, Jason Karceski, and Josef Lakonishok, “The Level and
Persistence  of  Growth  Rates,”  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research,
Working  Paper  No.  8282,  May,  2001,  available  at  www.nber.org/papers/
w8282.
9 Almost exactly 20 years earlier, in October 1982, Johnson & Johnson’s stock
lost  17.5%  of  its  value  in  a  week  when  several  people  died  after  ingesting
Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide by an unknown outsider. Johnson &
Johnson responded by pioneering the use of tamper-proof packaging, and the
stock went on to be one of the great investments of the 1980s.

Investors aren’t the only people who fall prey to the delusion that
hyper-growth can go on forever. In February 2000, chief execu-
tive John Roth of Nortel Networks was asked how much bigger
his giant fiber-optics company could get. “The industry is grow-
ing 14% to 15% a year,” Roth replied, “and we’re going to grow
six points faster than that. For a company our size, that’s pretty
heady stuff.” Nortel’s stock, up nearly 51% annually over the pre-
vious six years, was then trading at 87 times what Wall Street
was guessing it might earn in 2000. Was the stock overpriced?
“It’s getting up there,” shrugged Roth, “but there’s still plenty of
room to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless strat-
egy.”  (After  all,  he  added,  Cisco  Systems  was  trading  at  121
times its projected earnings!)1

As  for  Cisco,  in  November  2000,  its  chief  executive,  John
Chambers,  insisted  that  his  company  could  keep  growing  at
least 50% annually. “Logic,” he declared, “would indicate this is
a  breakaway.”  Cisco’s  stock  had  come  way  down—it  was  then
trading at a mere 98 times its earnings over the previous year—
and Chambers urged investors to buy. “So who you going to bet
on?” he asked. “Now may be the opportunity.” 2

Instead,  these  growth  companies  shrank—and  their  over-
priced stocks shriveled. Nortel’s revenues fell by 37% in 2001,
and the company lost more than $26 billion that year. Cisco’s
revenues did rise by 18% in 2001, but the company ended up
with  a  net  loss  of  more  than  $1  billion.  Nortel’s  stock,  at
$113.50  when  Roth  spoke,  finished  2002  at  $1.65.  Cisco’s
shares,  at  $52  when  Chambers  called  his  company  a  “break-
away,” crumbled to $13.

Both  companies  have  since  become  more  circumspect

about forecasting the future.

“Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket,” pro-
claimed  Andrew  Carnegie  a  century  ago.  “Do  not  scatter  your  shot.
. . . The great successes of life are made by concentration.” As Gra-
ham  points  out,  “the  really  big  fortunes  from  common  stocks”  have
been made by people who packed all their money into one investment
they knew supremely well.

Nearly all the richest people in America trace their wealth to a con-
centrated  investment  in  a  single  industry  or  even  a  single  company
(think  Bill  Gates  and  Microsoft,  Sam  Walton  and  Wal-Mart,  or  the
Rockefellers  and  Standard  Oil).  The  Forbes 400  list  of  the  richest
Americans, for example, has been dominated by undiversified fortunes
ever since it was first compiled in 1982.

However, almost no small fortunes have been made this way—and
not many big fortunes have been kept this way. What Carnegie neg-
lected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great
failures of life. Look again at the Forbes “Rich List.” Back in 1982, the
average  net  worth  of  a  Forbes 400  member  was  $230  million.  To
make  it  onto  the  2002  Forbes 400,  the  average  1982  member
needed  to  earn  only  a  4.5%  average  annual  return  on  his  wealth—
during a period when even bank accounts yielded far more than that
and the stock market gained an annual average of 13.2%.

So how many of the Forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on
the  list  20  years  later?  Only  64  of  the  original  members—a  measly
16%—were still on the list in 2002. By keeping all their eggs in the one
basket  that  had  gotten  them  onto  the  list  in  the  first  place—once-
booming  industries  like  oil  and  gas,  or  computer  hardware,  or  basic
manufacturing—all  the  other  original  members  fell  away.  When  hard
times hit, none of these people—despite all the huge advantages that
great  wealth  can  bring—were  properly  prepared.  They  could  only
stand by and wince at the sickening crunch as the constantly chang-
ing economy crushed their only basket and all their eggs.10

10 For  the  observation  that  it  is  amazingly  difficult  to  remain  on  the Forbes
400, I am indebted to investment manager Kenneth Fisher (himself a Forbes
columnist).

You might think that in our endlessly networked world, it would be a
cinch to build and buy a list of stocks that meet Graham’s criteria for
bargains (p. 169). Although the Internet is a help, you’ll still have to do
much of the work by hand.

Grab a copy of today’s Wall Street Journal, turn to the “Money &
Investing” section, and take a look at the NYSE and NASDAQ Score-
cards  to  find  the  day’s  lists  of  stocks  that  have  hit  new  lows  for  the
past year—a quick and easy way to search for companies that might
pass  Graham’s  net-working-capital  tests.  (Online,  try  http://quote.
morningstar.com/highlow.html?msection=HighLow.)

To see whether a stock is selling for less than the value of net work-
ing  capital  (what  Graham’s  followers  call  “net  nets”),  download  or
request the most recent quarterly or annual report from the company’s
website  or  from  the  EDGAR  database  at  www.sec.gov.  From  the
company’s  current  assets,  subtract  its  total  liabilities,  including  any
preferred  stock  and  long-term  debt.  (Or  consult  your  local  public
library’s  copy  of  the  Value  Line  Investment  Survey,  saving  yourself  a
costly annual subscription. Each issue carries a list of “Bargain Base-
ment Stocks” that come close to Graham’s definition.) Most of these
stocks  lately  have  been  in  bombed-out  areas  like  high-tech  and
telecommunications.

As of October 31, 2002, for instance, Comverse Technology had
$2.4 billion in current assets and $1.0 billion in total liabilities, giving it
$1.4 billion in net working capital. With fewer than 190 million shares
of stock, and a stock price under $8 per share, Comverse had a total
market capitalization of just under $1.4 billion. With the stock priced
at  no  more  than  the  value  of  Comverse’s  cash  and  inventories,  the
company’s  ongoing  business  was  essentially  selling  for  nothing.  As
Graham  knew,  you  can  still  lose  money  on  a  stock  like  Comverse—
which is why you should buy them only if you can find a couple dozen
at a time and hold them patiently. But on the very rare occasions when
Mr. Market generates that many true bargains, you’re all but certain to
make money.

Investing  in  foreign  stocks  may  not  be  mandatory  for  the  intelligent
investor,  but  it  is  definitely  advisable.  Why?  Let’s  try  a  little  thought

Commentary on Chapter 7

experiment. It’s the end of 1989, and you’re Japanese. Here are the
facts:

•

• Over the past 10 years, your stock market has gained an annual
average  of  21.2%,  well  ahead  of  the  17.5%  annual  gains  in  the
United States.
Japanese  companies  are  buying  up  everything  in  the  United
States from the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center;
meanwhile,  American  firms  like  Drexel  Burnham  Lambert,  Finan-
cial Corp. of America, and Texaco are going bankrupt.
The U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan’s is booming.

•

In 1989, in the land of the rising sun, you can only conclude that
investing  outside  of  Japan  is  the  dumbest  idea  since  sushi  vending
machines. Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks.

The  result?  Over  the  next  decade,  you  lose  roughly  two-thirds  of

your money.

The lesson? It’s not that you should never invest in foreign markets
like  Japan;  it’s  that  the  Japanese  should  never  have  kept  all  their
money  at  home.  And  neither  should  you.  If  you  live  in  the  United
States, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are
already making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent,
you  should  put  some  of  your  investment  portfolio  elsewhere—simply
because no one, anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at
home or abroad. Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual
funds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets)
helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be
the best place in the world to invest.

CHAPTER 8

The Investor and Market Fluctuations

To  the  extent  that  the  investor’s  funds  are  placed  in  high-grade
bonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he
will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and
need not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdings
of U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price
or  more.)  His  longer-term  bonds  may  have  relatively  wide  price
swings  during  their  lifetimes,  and  his  common-stock  portfolio  is
almost  certain  to  fluctuate  in  value  over  any  period  of  several
years.

The investor should know about these possibilities and should
be prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will
want to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly through
an advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, and
perhaps  also  by  making  purchases  and  sales  at  advantageous
prices.  This  interest  on  his  part  is  inevitable,  and  legitimate
enough.  But  it  involves  the  very  real  danger  that  it  will  lead  him
into speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you
not  to  speculate;  the  hard  thing  will  be  for  you  to  follow  this
advice.  Let  us  repeat  what  we  said  at  the  outset:  If  you  want  to
speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-
bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program.

We shall  deal  first  with  the  more  important  subject  of  price
changes  in  common  stocks,  and  pass  later  to  the  area  of  bonds. 
In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’s
action over the past hundred years. In this section we shall return
to  that  material  from  time  to  time,  in  order  to  see  what  the  past
record  promises  the  investor—in  either  the  form  of  long-term
appreciation  of  a  portfolio  held  relatively  unchanged  through

Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions

Since common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to
recurrent  and  wide  fluctuations  in  their  prices,  the  intelligent
investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from
these  pendulum  swings.  There  are  two  possible  ways  by  which 
he  may  try  to  do  this:  the  way  of  timing and  the  way  of  pricing.
By  timing  we  mean  the  endeavor  to  anticipate  the  action  of  the
stock  market—to  buy  or  hold  when  the  future  course  is  deemed 
to  be  upward,  to  sell  or  refrain  from  buying  when  the  course 
is  downward.  By  pricing  we  mean  the  endeavor  to  buy  stocks
when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when
they  rise  above  such  value.  A less  ambitious  form  of  pricing  is 
the  simple  effort  to  make  sure  that  when  you  buy  you  do  not 
pay  too  much  for  your  stocks.  This  may  suffice  for  the  defen-
sive  investor,  whose  emphasis  is  on  long-pull  holding;  but  as 
such  it  represents  an  essential  minimum  of  attention  to  market 
levels.1

We are  convinced  that  the  intelligent  investor  can  derive  satis-
factory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure that
if he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting, he
will  end  up  as  a  speculator  and  with  a  speculator’s  financial
results.  This  distinction  may  seem  rather  tenuous  to  the  layman,
and  it  is  not  commonly  accepted  on  Wall  Street.  As  a  matter  of
business  practice,  or  perhaps  of  thoroughgoing  conviction,  the
stock  brokers  and  the  investment  services  seem  wedded  to  the
principle  that  both  investors  and  speculators  in  common  stocks
should devote careful attention to market forecasts.

The farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one
will find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecast-
ing or timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer-
able  predictions  which  appear  almost  daily  and  are  his  for  the
asking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts
upon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is impor-
tant for him to form some opinion of the future course of the stock

190

market, and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast
is at least more dependable than his own.*

We lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of mar-
ket forecasting. A great deal of brain power goes into this field, and
undoubtedly some  people can  make  money  by  being  good  stock-
market analysts. But it is absurd to think that the general public can
ever make money out of market forecasts. For who will buy when
the general public, at a given signal, rushes to sell out at a profit? If
you, the reader, expect to get rich over the years by following some
system or leadership in market forecasting, you must be expecting
to try to do what countless others are aiming at, and to be able to
do it better than your numerous competitors in the market. There
is  no  basis  either  in  logic  or  in  experience  for  assuming  that  any
typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more
successfully than the general public, of which he is himself a part.

There is one aspect of the “timing” philosophy which seems to
have  escaped  everyone’s  notice.  Timing  is  of  great  psychological
importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in

* In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became more influ-
ential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become more accurate.
On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite index hit its
all-time  high  of  5048.62,  Prudential  Securities’s  chief  technical  analyst
Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected NASDAQ to hit 6000
within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to
3321.29—but  Thomas  Galvin,  a  market  strategist  at  Donaldson,  Lufkin  &
Jenrette, declared that “there’s only 200 or 300 points of downside for the
NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It turned out that there were no points
on  the  upside  and  more  than  2000  on  the  downside,  as  NASDAQ  kept
crashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In
March 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman,
Sachs & Co., predicted that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index would
close the year at 1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would
finish 2001 at 13,000. “We do not expect a recession,” said Cohen, “and
believe  that  corporate  profits  are  likely  to  grow  at  close  to  trend  growth
rates later this year.” The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as
she spoke, and the S & P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the Dow fin-
ished at 10,021.50—30% and 23% below her forecasts, respectively.

a  hurry.  The  idea  of  waiting  a  year  before  his  stock  moves  up  is
repugnant  to  him.  But  a  waiting  period,  as  such,  is  of  no  conse-
quence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having
his  money  uninvested  until  he  receives  some  (presumably)  trust-
worthy signal that the time has come to buy? He enjoys an advan-
tage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently
lower price to offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is
that  timing  is  of  no  real  value  to  the  investor  unless  it  coincides
with pricing—that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares
at substantially under his previous selling price.

In this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and
sales  has  had  an  unusual  history.*  Briefly,  this  technique  takes  its
signal  to  buy  from  a  special  kind  of  “breakthrough”  of  the  stock
averages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-
through  on  the  down  side.  The  calculated—not  necessarily
actual—results of using this method showed an almost unbroken
series of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s. On the
basis  of  this  presentation  the  practical  value  of  the  Dow  theory
would have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if any, would
apply to the dependability of this published “record” as a picture
of what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the market.

A closer  study  of  the  figures  indicates  that  the  quality  of  the
results  shown  by  the  Dow  theory  changed  radically  after  1938—
a  few  years  after  the  theory  had  begun  to  be  taken  seriously  on
Wall  Street.  Its  spectacular  achievement  had  been  in  giving  a  sell
signal, at 306, about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping
its  followers  out  of  the  long  bear  market  until  things  had  pretty
well righted themselves, at 84, in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow
theory  operated  mainly  by  taking  its  practitioners  out  at  a  pretty
good price but then putting them back in again at a higher price.
For  nearly  30  years  thereafter,  one  would  have  done  appreciably
better by just buying and holding the DJIA.2

In our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in
the Dow-theory results is not accidental. It demonstrates an inher-
ent characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields
of  business  and  finance.  Those  formulas  that  gain  adherents  and

importance do so because they have worked well over a period, or
sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the
statistical record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their
reliability  tends  to  diminish.  This  happens  for  two  reasons:  First,
the passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula
no  longer  fits.  Second,  in  stock-market  affairs  the  popularity  of  a
trading  theory  has  itself  an  influence  on  the  market’s  behavior
which detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.
(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre-
ate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance or
decline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling
signal is given. A “stampede” of this kind is, of course, much more
of a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)

Buy-Low–Sell-High Approach

We are convinced that the average investor cannot deal success-
fully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can
he  benefit  from  them  after they  have  taken  place—i.e.,  by  buying
after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?
The fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to
1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic
definition of a “shrewd investor” was “one who bought in a bear
market when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar-
ket  when  everyone  else  was  buying.”  If  we  examine  our  Chart  I,
covering the fluctuations of the Standard & Poor’s composite index
between 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.
66),  we  can  readily  see  why  this  viewpoint  appeared  valid  until
fairly recent years.

Between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles,
running  from  bear-market  low  to  bull-market  high  and  back  to
bear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, four
ran for six or seven years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of
1921–1932—lasted  eleven  years.  The  percentage  of  advance  from
the  lows  to  highs  ranged  from  44%  to  500%,  with  most  between
about  50%  and  100%.  The  percentage  of  subsequent  declines
ranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40% and 50%.
(It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a pre-
ceding advance of 100%.)

Nearly all the bull markets had a number of well-defined char-
acteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level, (2)
high price/earnings ratios, (3) low dividend yields as against bond
yields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of
new  common-stock  issues  of  poor  quality.  Thus  to  the  student  of
stock-market  history  it  appeared  that  the  intelligent  investor
should have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar-
kets, to buy in the former and sell in the latter, and to do so for the
most  part  at  reasonably  short  intervals  of  time.  Various  methods
were  developed  for  determining  buying  and  selling  levels  of  the
general market, based on either value factors or percentage move-
ments of prices or both.

But we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull
market  that  began  in  1949,  there  were  sufficient  variations  in  the
successive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the
desirable process of buying low and selling high. The most notable
of these departures, of course, was the great bull market of the late
1920s, which threw all calculations badly out of gear.* Even in 1949,
therefore,  it  was  by  no  means  a  certainty  that  the  investor  could
base his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor
to buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in
bull markets.

It  turned  out,  in  the  sequel,  that  the  opposite  was  true.  The

* Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone waiting to
“buy  low”  will  feel  completely  left  behind—and,  all  too  often,  will  end  up
abandoning  any  former  caution  and  jumping  in  with  both  feet.  That’s  why
Graham’s  message  about  the  importance  of  emotional  discipline is  so
important.  From  October  1990  through  January  2000,  the  Dow  Jones
Industrial  Average  marched  relentlessly  upward,  never  losing  more  than
20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The total gain
(not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall, Pierce & Co., this
was the second-longest uninterrupted bull market of the past century; only
the  1949–1961  boom  lasted  longer.  The  longer  a  bull  market  lasts,  the
more severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so,
many  people  no  longer  believe  that  bear  markets  are  even  possible.  All
those  who  forget  are  doomed  to  be  reminded;  and,  in  the  stock  market,
recovered memories are always unpleasant.

market’s behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former
pattern,  nor  obeyed  what  once  were  well-established  danger  sig-
nals, nor permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules
for  buying  low  and  selling  high.  Whether  the  old,  fairly  regular
bull-and-bear-market  pattern  will  eventually  return  we  do  not
know. But it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to
base  his  present  policy  on  the  classic  formula—i.e.,  to  wait  for
demonstrable  bear-market  levels  before  buying  any common
stocks.  Our  recommended  policy  has,  however,  made  provision 
for  changes  in  the  proportion of  common  stocks  to  bonds  in  the
portfolio,  if  the  investor  chooses  to  do  so,  according  as  the  level 
of  stock  prices  appears  less  or  more  attractive  by  value  stan-
dards.*

Formula Plans

In the early years of the stock-market rise that began in 1949–50
considerable  interest  was  attracted  to  various  methods  of  taking
advantage of the stock market’s cycles. These have been known as
“formula investment plans.” The essence of all such plans—except
the simple case of dollar averaging—is that the investor automati-
cally  does  some selling  of  common  stocks  when  the  market
advances  substantially.  In  many  of  them  a  very  large  rise  in  the
market level would result in the sale of all common-stock holdings;
others  provided  for  retention  of  a  minor  proportion  of  equities
under all circumstances.

This approach had the double appeal of sounding logical (and
conservative) and of showing excellent results when applied retro-
spectively to the stock market over many years in the past. Unfor-
tunately,  its  vogue  grew  greatest  at  the  very  time  when  it  was
destined to work least well. Many of the “formula planners” found
themselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level
in the middle 1950s. True, they had realized excellent profits, but in
a  broad  sense  the  market  “ran  away”  from  them  thereafter,  and

* Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4 (pp. 89–91).
This policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is widely followed by insti-
tutional investors like pension funds and university endowments.

their formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common-
stock position.*

There  is  a  similarity  between  the  experience  of  those  adopting
the formula-investing approach in the early 1950s and those who
embraced the purely mechanical version of the Dow theory some
20  years  earlier.  In  both  cases  the  advent  of  popularity  marked
almost the exact moment when the system ceased to work well. We
have  had  a  like  discomfiting  experience  with  our  own  “central
value method” of determining indicated buying and selling levels
of  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial Average.  The  moral  seems  to  be  that
any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be
easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too
simple and too easy to last.† Spinoza’s concluding remark applies
to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: “All things excellent are as
difficult as they are rare.”

Market Fluctuations of the Investor’s Portfolio

Every  investor  who  owns  common  stocks  must  expect  to  see
them  fluctuate  in  value  over  the  years.  The  behavior  of  the  DJIA
since our last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty
well  what  has  happened  to  the  stock  portfolio  of  a  conservative
investor  who  limited  his  stock  holdings  to  those  of  large,  promi-
nent, and conservatively financed corporations. The overall value
advanced  from  an  average  level  of  about  890  to  a  high  of  995  in

* Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks at the
end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the second-highest
yearly return then on record. Over the next five years, these market-timers
would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks doubled.
† Easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons: the
natural  tendency  of  trends  to  reverse  over  time,  or  “regress  to  the  mean,”
and  the  rapid  adoption  of  the  stock-picking  scheme  by  large  numbers  of
people, who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got there first. (Note
that,  in  referring  to  his  “discomfiting  experience,”  Graham  is—as  always—
honest  in  admitting  his  own  failures.)  See  Jason  Zweig,  “Murphy  Was  an
Investor,”  Money, July,  2002,  pp.  61–62,  and  Jason  Zweig,  “New  Year’s
Play,” Money, December, 2000, pp. 89–90.

1966  (and  985  again  in  1968),  fell  to  631  in  1970,  and  made  an
almost  full  recovery  to  940  in  early  1971.  (Since  the  individual
issues  set  their  high  and  low  marks  at  different  times,  the  fluc-
tuations  in  the  Dow  Jones  group  as  a  whole  are  less  severe  than
those  in  the  separate  components.)  We  have  traced  through  the
price  fluctuations  of  other  types  of  diversified  and  conservative 
common-stock  portfolios  and  we  find  that  the  overall  results  are
not likely to be markedly different from the above. In general, the
shares  of  second-line  companies *  fluctuate  more  widely  than  the
major ones, but this does not necessarily mean that a group of well-
established  but  smaller  companies  will  make  a  poorer  showing
over  a  fairly  long  period.  In  any  case  the  investor  may  as  well
resign  himself  in  advance  to  the  probability  rather  than  the  mere
possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more
from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more
from their high point at various periods in the next five years.†

A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or
even  month-to-month  fluctuations  of  the  stock  market  make  him
richer  or  poorer.  But  what  about  the  longer-term  and  wider
changes? Here practical questions present themselves, and the psy-
chological problems are likely to grow complicated. A substantial
rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and
a cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring a strong tempta-
tion  toward  imprudent  action. Your  shares  have  advanced,  good!

* Today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “second-line companies” would
be  any  of  the  thousands  of  stocks  not  included  in  the  Standard  &  Poor’s
500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500 stocks in the S & P index
is available at www.standardandpoors.com.
† Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible, but prob-
able, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50% from their low-
est price and lose at least 33% from their highest price—regardless of which
stocks you own or whether the market as a whole goes up or down. If you
can’t live with that—or you think your portfolio is somehow magically exempt
from  it—then  you  are  not  yet  entitled  to  call  yourself  an  investor.  (Graham
refers to a 33% decline as the “equivalent one-third” because a 50% gain
takes a $10 stock to $15. From $15, a 33% loss [or $5 drop] takes it right
back to $10, where it started.)

You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high,
and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for
not  having  bought  more  shares  when  the  level  was  lower?  Or—
worst thought of all—should you now give way to the bull-market
atmosphere,  become  infected  with  the  enthusiasm,  the  overconfi-
dence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are
a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented
thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but
even  the  intelligent  investor  is  likely  to  need  considerable  will
power to keep from following the crowd.

It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calcu-
lation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechan-
ical  method  for  varying  the  proportion  of  bonds  to  stocks  in  the
investor’s  portfolio.  The  chief  advantage,  perhaps,  is  that  such  a
formula will give him something to do. As the market advances he
will from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings, putting
the  proceeds  into  bonds;  as  it  declines  he  will  reverse  the  proce-
dure.  These  activities  will  provide  some  outlet  for  his  otherwise
too-pent-up energies. If he is the right kind of investor he will take
added satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly
opposite from those of the crowd.*

Business Valuations versus Stock-Market Valuations

The impact of market fluctuations upon the investor’s true situ-
ation  may  be  considered  also  from  the  standpoint  of  the  share-
holder  as  the  part  owner  of  various  businesses.  The  holder  of
marketable  shares  actually  has  a  double  status,  and  with  it  the
privilege  of  taking  advantage  of  either  at  his  choice.  On  the  one
hand his position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or
silent  partner  in  a  private  business.  Here  his  results  are  entirely
dependent  on  the  profits  of  the  enterprise  or  on  a  change  in  the
underlying  value  of  its  assets.  He  would  usually  determine  the
value of such a private-business interest by calculating his share of
the  net  worth  as  shown  in  the  most  recent  balance  sheet.  On  the

ancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.

other hand, the common-stock investor holds a piece of paper, an
engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes
at a price which varies from moment to moment—when the mar-
ket  is  open,  that  is—and  often  is  far  removed  from  the  balance-
sheet value.*

The  development  of  the  stock  market  in  recent  decades  has
made  the  typical  investor  more  dependent  on  the  course  of  price
quotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a
business  owner.  The  reason  is  that  the  successful  enterprises  in
which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly
at  prices  well  above  their  net  asset  value  (or  book  value,  or 
“balance-sheet  value”).  In  paying  these  market  premiums  the
investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on
the stock market itself to validate his commitments.†

This  is  a  factor  of  prime  importance  in  present-day  investing,
and it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-
ture  of  stock-market  quotations  contains  a  built-in  contradiction.
The better a company’s record and prospects, the less relationship
the price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greater
the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of deter-
mining its intrinsic value—i.e., the more this “value” will depend
on  the  changing  moods  and  measurements  of  the  stock  market.
Thus we reach the final paradox, that the more successful the com-
pany, the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its
shares.  This  really  means  that,  in  a  very  real  sense,  the  better  the

* Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only upon
special  request.  Stocks  exist,  for  the  most  part,  in  purely  electronic  form
(much as your bank account contains computerized credits and debits, not
actual currency) and thus have become even easier to trade than they were
in Graham’s day.
† Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and tangible-asset value
are  all  synonyms  for  net  worth,  or  the  total  value  of  a  company’s  physical
and financial assets minus all its liabilities. It can be calculated using the bal-
ance sheets in a company’s annual and quarterly reports; from total share-
holders’ equity, subtract all “soft” assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and
other intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to
arrive at book value per share.

quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be—at
least  as  compared  with  the  unspectacular  middle-grade  issues.*
(What we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth
companies with the bulk of well-established concerns; we exclude
from  our  purview  here  those  issues  which  are  highly  speculative
because the businesses themselves are speculative.)

The argument made above should explain the often erratic price
behavior  of  our  most  successful  and  impressive  enterprises.  Our
favorite  example  is  the  monarch  of  them  all—International  Busi-
ness Machines. The price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven
months in 1962–63; after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in
1970.  Similarly,  Xerox—an  even  more  impressive  earnings  gainer
in recent decades—fell from 171 to 87 in 1962–63, and from 116 to
65 in 1970. These striking losses did not indicate any doubt about
the future long-term growth of IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead
a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock mar-
ket itself had placed on these excellent prospects.

The  previous  discussion  leads  us  to  a  conclusion  of  practical
importance to the conservative investor in common stocks. If he is
to  pay  some  special  attention  to  the  selection  of  his  portfolio,  it
might be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reason-
ably close approximation to their tangible-asset value—say, at not
more  than  one-third  above  that  figure.  Purchases  made  at  such 
levels,  or  lower,  may  with  logic  be  regarded  as  related  to  the

* Graham’s  use  of  the  word  “paradox”  is  probably  an  allusion  to  a  classic
article by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox,” The
Journal  of  Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957, pp. 348–363, which
compares  investing  in  high-priced  growth  stocks  to  betting  on  a  series  of
coin  flips  in  which  the  payoff  escalates  with  each  flip  of  the  coin.  Durand
points out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for 
an indefinite period of time, an investor should (in theory) be willing to pay
an  infinite  price  for  its  shares.  Why,  then,  has  no  stock  ever  sold  for  a 
price of infinity dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future
growth  rate,  and  the  longer  the  time  period  over  which  it  is  expected,  the
wider the margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis-
calculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in Appendix 4
(p. 570).

company’s balance sheet, and as having a justification or support
independent  of  the  fluctuating  market  prices.  The  premium  over
book  value  that  may  be  involved  can  be  considered  as  a  kind  of
extra fee paid for the advantage of stock-exchange listing and the
marketability that goes with it.

A caution  is  needed  here.  A stock  does  not  become  a  sound
investment  merely  because  it  can  be  bought  at  close  to  its  asset
value. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio
of earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the
prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.
This  may  appear  like  demanding  a  lot  from  a  modestly  priced
stock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger-
ously high market conditions. Once the investor is willing to forgo
brilliant prospects—i.e., better than average expected growth—he
will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting
these criteria.

In our chapters on the selection of common stocks (Chapters 14
and 15) we shall give data showing that more than half of the DJIA
issues  met  our  asset-value  criterion  at  the  end  of  1970.  The  most
widely held investment of all—American Tel. & Tel.—actually sells
below  its  tangible-asset  value  as  we  write.  Most  of  the  light-and-
power shares, in addition to their other advantages, are now (early
1972) available at prices reasonably close to their asset values.

The  investor  with  a  stock  portfolio  having  such  book  values
behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of
stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipli-
ers  of  both  earnings  and  tangible  assets.  As  long  as  the  earning
power  of  his  holdings  remains  satisfactory,  he  can  give  as  little
attention  as  he  pleases  to  the  vagaries  of  the  stock  market.  More
than  that,  at  times  he  can  use  these  vagaries  to  play  the  master
game of buying low and selling high.

The A. & P. Example

At  this  point  we  shall  introduce  one  of  our  original  examples,
which dates back many years but which has a certain fascination
for  us  because  it  combines  so  many  aspects  of  corporate  and
investment experience. It involves the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Co. Here is the story:

The Investor and Market Fluctuations

201

A. & P. shares were introduced to trading on the “Curb” market,
now the American Stock Exchange, in 1929 and sold as high as 494.
By 1932 they had declined to 104, although the company’s earnings
were  nearly  as  large  in  that  generally  catastrophic  year  as  previ-
ously. In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the busi-
ness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low
of 36.

That  price  was  extraordinary.  It  meant  that  the  preferred  and
common were together selling for $126 million, although the com-
pany had just reported that it held $85 million in cash alone and a
working capital (or net current assets) of $134 million. A. & P. was
the largest retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a
continuous  and  impressive  record  of  large  earnings  for  many
years.  Yet  in  1938  this  outstanding  business  was  considered  on
Wall  Street  to  be  worth  less  than  its  current  assets  alone—which
means  less  as  a  going  concern  than  if  it  were  liquidated.  Why?
First,  because  there  were  threats  of  special  taxes  on  chain  stores;
second, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and,
third, because the general market was depressed. The first of these
reasons  was  an  exaggerated  and  eventually  groundless  fear;  the
other two were typical of temporary influences.

Let us assume that the investor had bought A. & P. common in
1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80. We
are  far  from  asserting  that  the  ensuing  decline  to  36  was  of  no
importance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize
the picture with some care, to see whether he had made any mis-
calculations.  But  if  the  results  of  his  study  were  reassuring—as
they should have been—he was entitled then to disregard the mar-
ket  decline  as  a  temporary  vagary  of  finance,  unless  he  had  the
funds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on
the bargain basis offered.

Sequel and Reflections

The  following  year,  1939,  A.  &  P.  shares  advanced  to  1171⁄2,  or
three  times  the  low  price  of  1938  and  well  above  the  average  of
1937. Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no
means uncommon, but in the case of A. & P. it was more striking
than  most.  In  the  years  after  1949  the  grocery  chain’s  shares  rose

202

The Intelligent Investor

with the general market until in 1961 the split-up stock (10 for 1)
reached  a  high  of  701⁄2 which  was  equivalent  to  705  for  the  1938
shares.

This price of 701⁄2 was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the
earnings  of  1961.  Such  a  price/earnings  ratio—which  compares
with 23 times for the DJIA in that year—must have implied expec-
tations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no jus-
tification in the company’s earnings record in the preceding years,
and it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the
course of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward.
The year after the 701⁄2 high the price fell by more than half to 34.
But this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they
showed at the low quotation in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctua-
tions the price fell to another low of 211⁄2 in 1970 and 18 in 1972—
having reported the first quarterly deficit in its history.

We see  in  this  history  how  wide  can  be  the  vicissitudes  of  a
major American enterprise in little more than a single generation,
and also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and
pessimism  the  public  has  valued  its  shares.  In  1938  the  business
was really being given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was
clamoring  for  the  shares  at  a  ridiculously  high  price.  After  that
came a quick loss of half the market value, and some years later a
substantial  further  decline.  In  the  meantime  the  company  was  to
turn  from  an  outstanding  to  a  mediocre  earnings  performer;  its
profit in the boom-year 1968 was to be less than in 1958; it had paid
a  series  of  confusing  small  stock  dividends  not  warranted  by  the
current additions to surplus; and so forth. A. & P. was a larger com-
pany  in  1961  and  1972  than  in  1938,  but  not  as  well-run,  not  as
profitable, and not as attractive.*

There are two chief morals to this story. The first is that the stock
market  often  goes  far  wrong,  and  sometimes  an  alert  and  coura-

* The  more  recent  history  of  A  &  P  is  no  different.  At  year-end  1999,  its
share price was $27.875; at year-end 2000, $7.00; a year later, $23.78; at
year-end 2002, $8.06. Although some accounting irregularities later came
to light at A & P, it defies all logic to believe that the value of a relatively sta-
ble business like groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the
next year, then drop by two-thirds the year after that.

geous investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is
that  most  businesses  change  in  character  and  quality  over  the
years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse.
The  investor  need  not  watch  his  companies’  performance  like  a
hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.

Let  us  return  to  our  comparison  between  the  holder  of  mar-
ketable shares and the man with an interest in a private business.
We have said that the former has the option of considering himself
merely as the part owner of the various businesses he has invested
in,  or  as  the  holder  of  shares  which  are  salable  at  any  time  he
wishes at their quoted market price.

But  note  this  important  fact:  The  true  investor  scarcely  ever  is
forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard
the  current  price  quotation.  He  need  pay  attention  to  it  and  act
upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus
the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor-
ried  by  unjustified  market  declines  in  his  holdings  is  perversely
transforming  his  basic  advantage  into  a  basic  disadvantage.  That
man  would  be  better  off  if  his  stocks  had  no  market  quotation  at
all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by
other persons’ mistakes of judgment.†

Incidentally, a widespread situation of this kind actually existed
during  the  dark  depression  days  of  1931–1933.  There  was  then  a
psychological advantage in owning business interests that had no
quoted  market.  For  example,  people  who  owned  first  mortgages
on real estate that continued to pay interest were able to tell them-
selves that their investments had kept their full value, there being
no  market  quotations  to  indicate  otherwise.  On  the  other  hand,
many  listed  corporation  bonds  of  even  better  quality  and  greater

* “Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the extent that the
price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.” In traditional brokerage
lingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of holdings and trades.

book. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of experience. You
cannot read these words too often; they are like Kryptonite for bear markets.

underlying  strength  suffered  severe  shrinkages  in  their  market
quotations,  thus  making  their  owners  believe  they  were  growing
distinctly  poorer.  In  reality  the  owners  were  better  off  with  the
listed  securities,  despite  the  low  prices  of  these.  For  if  they  had
wanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold the
issues—possibly  to  exchange  them  for  even  better  bargains.  Or
they  could  just  as  logically  have  ignored  the  market’s  action  as
temporary and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell
yourself  that  you  have  suffered  no  shrinkage  in  value  merely
because your securities have no quoted market at all.

Returning to our A. & P. shareholder in 1938, we assert that as
long as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price
decline,  beyond  what  his  own  judgment  may  have  told  him  was
occasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If
no  such  shrinkage  had  occurred,  he  had  a  right  to  expect  that  in
due course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or
better—as in fact it did the following year. In this respect his posi-
tion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private
business with no quoted market for its shares. For in that case, too,
he might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off
part  of  the  cost  of  his  holdings  because  of  the  impact  of  the  1938
recession—depending on what had happened to his company.

Critics  of  the  value  approach  to  stock  investment  argue  that
listed common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in
the same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because
the  presence  of  an  organized  security  market  “injects  into  equity
ownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity.”
But what this liquidity really means is, first, that the investor has
the  benefit  of  the  stock  market’s  daily  and  changing  appraisal  of
his  holdings,  for  whatever  that  appraisal  may  be  worth, and,  second,
that  the  investor  is  able  to  increase  or  decrease  his  investment  at
the  market’s  daily  figure—if  he  chooses. Thus  the  existence  of  a
quoted  market  gives  the  investor  certain  options that  he  does  not
have if his security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current
quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from
some other source.

Let us close this section with something in the nature of a para-
ble. Imagine that in some private business you own a small share
that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is

The Investor and Market Fluctuations

205

very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your
interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to
sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of
value  appears  plausible  and  justified  by  business  developments
and  prospects  as  you  know  them.  Often,  on  the  other  hand,  Mr.
Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the
value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.

If you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you
let Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the
value of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree
with him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy
to  sell  out  to  him  when  he  quotes  you  a  ridiculously  high  price,
and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the
rest  of  the  time  you  will  be  wiser  to  form  your  own  ideas  of  the
value  of  your  holdings,  based  on  full  reports  from  the  company
about its operations and financial position.

The true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed
common stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or
leave it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He
must take cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise
his judgment will have nothing to work on. Conceivably they may
give him a warning signal which he will do well to heed—this in
plain English means that he is to sell his shares because the price has
gone down, foreboding worse things to come. In our view such sig-
nals are misleading at least as often as they are helpful. Basically,
price  fluctuations  have  only  one  significant  meaning  for  the  true
investor.  They  provide  him  with  an  opportunity  to  buy  wisely
when  prices  fall  sharply  and  to  sell  wisely  when  they  advance  a
great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the
stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the
operating results of his companies.

Summary

The most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec-
ulator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements.
The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting
from  market  fluctuations.  The  investor’s  primary  interest  lies  in
acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market

206

movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they
alternately  create  low  price  levels  at  which  he  would  be  wise  to
buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from
buying and probably would be wise to sell.

It  is  far  from  certain  that  the  typical  investor  should  regularly
hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may
involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible
missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better
for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to
put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher
than can be justified by well-established standards of value. If he
wants to be shrewd he can look for the ever-present bargain oppor-
tunities in individual securities.

Aside  from  forecasting  the  movements  of  the  general  market,
much effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting
stocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will “do better”
than the rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this
endeavor may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or
temperament of the true investor—particularly since he would be
competing with a large number of stock-market traders and first-
class  financial  analysts  who  are  trying  to  do  the  same  thing.  As 
in  all  other  activities  that  emphasize  price  movements  first  and
underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds con-
stantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-
defeating over the years.

The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their
prices  to  fluctuate  and  should  neither  be  concerned  by  sizable
declines  nor  become  excited  by  sizable  advances.  He  should
always  remember  that  market  quotations  are  there  for  his  conve-
nience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should
never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has
gone  down.  He  would  not  be  far  wrong  if  this  motto  read  more
simply: “Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or
sell one immediately after a substantial drop.”

An Added Consideration

Something should be said about the significance of average mar-
ket prices as a measure of managerial competence. The shareholder

The Investor and Market Fluctuations

207

judges  whether  his  own  investment  has  been  successful  in  terms
both of dividends received and of the long-range trend of the aver-
age market value. The same criteria should logically be applied in
testing  the  effectiveness  of  a  company’s  management  and  the
soundness of its attitude toward the owners of the business.

This  statement  may  sound  like  a  truism,  but  it  needs  to  be
emphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approach
by which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On
the contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no
responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of
their shares. It is true, of course, that they are not accountable for
those fluctuations in price which, as we have been insisting, bear no
relationship to underlying conditions and values. But it is only the
lack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of share-
holders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of
market  quotations,  including  the  permanent  establishment  of  a
depreciated  and  unsatisfactory  price  level.  Good  managements
produce a good average market price, and bad managements pro-
duce bad market prices.*

Fluctuations in Bond Prices

The investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin-
cipal  and  interest  may  be  unquestioned,  a  long-term  bond  could
vary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates.
In Table 8-1 we give data for various years back to 1902 covering
yields for high-grade corporate and tax-free issues. As individual
illustrations  we  add  the  price  fluctuations  of  two  representative
railroad issues for a similar period. (These are the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe general mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of
our premier noncallable bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry.
3s, due 2047—originally a 150-year maturity!—long a typical Baa-
rated bond.)

Because of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond
to  the  high  prices  and  vice  versa.  The  decline  in  the  Northern

* Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate gov-
ernance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.

208

The Intelligent Investor

Pacific 3s in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the
issue. It is extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high
in the next few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly
because of the rise in general interest rates. There have been star-
tling  variations,  as  well,  in  the  price  of  even  the  highest-grade
bonds in the past forty years.

Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro-
portion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value
of  100%  exerts  a  moderating  influence.  However,  for  very  long
maturities,  as  in  our  Northern  Pacific  example,  prices  and  yields
change at close to the same rate.

Since 1964 record movements in both directions have taken place
in  the  high-grade  bond  market.  Taking  “prime  municipals”  (tax-
free)  as  an  example,  their  yield  more  than  doubled,  from  3.2%  in
January 1965 to 7% in June 1970. Their price index declined, corre-
spondingly,  from  110.8  to  67.5.  In  mid-1970  the  yields  on  high-
grade  long-term  bonds  were  higher  than  at  any  time  in  the  nearly
200 years of this country’s economic history.* Twenty-five years earlier,
just before our protracted bull market began, bond yields were at
their lowest point in history; long-term municipals returned as little
as 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared with the 41⁄2 to 5% for-
merly considered “normal.” Those of us with a long experience on
Wall Street had seen Newton’s law of “action and reaction, equal
and opposite” work itself out repeatedly in the stock market—the
most  noteworthy  example  being  the  rise  in  the  DJIA from  64  in
1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But
this  time  the  widest  pendulum  swings  took  place  in  the  usually
staid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields.
Moral:  Nothing  important  on  Wall  Street  can  be  counted  on  to
occur  exactly  in  the  same  way  as  it  happened  before.  This  repre-

* By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields on long-
term  U.S.  Treasury  bonds  hit  their  lowest levels  since  1963.  Since  bond
yields  move  inversely  to  prices,  those  low  yields  meant  that  prices  had
risen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most
expensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low. This
provides another proof of Graham’s lesson that the intelligent investor must
refuse to make decisions based on market fluctuations.

The Intelligent Investor

sents the first half of our favorite dictum: “The more it changes, the
more it’s the same thing.”

If  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  make  worthwhile  predictions
about the price movements of stocks, it is completely impossible to
do  so  for  bonds.*  In  the  old  days,  at  least,  one  could  often  find  a
useful clue to the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying
the prior action of bonds, but no similar clues were given to a com-
ing  change  in  interest  rates  and  bond  prices.  Hence  the  investor
must choose between long-term and short-term bond investments
on  the  basis  chiefly  of  his  personal  preferences.  If  he  wants  to  be
certain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are
probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described
above,  p.  93.  Either  issue  will  give  him  a  5%  yield  (after  the  first
year),  the  Series  E  for  up  to  55⁄6 years,  the  Series  H  for  up  to  ten
years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.

If the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term
corporate  bonds,  or  the  5.3%  on  tax-free  municipals,  he  must  be
prepared to see them fluctuate in price. Banks and insurance com-
panies have the privilege of valuing high-rated bonds of this type
on  the  mathematical  basis  of  “amortized  cost,”  which  disregards
market  prices;  it  would  not  be  a  bad  idea  for  the  individual
investor to do something similar.

The price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks
are  the  resultant  of  three  different  factors:  (1)  variations  in  the 
price  of  the  related  common  stock,  (2)  variations  in  the  credit
standing  of  the  company,  and  (3)  variations  in  general  interest
rates.  A good  many  of  the  convertible  issues  have  been  sold  by
companies  that  have  credit  ratings  well  below  the  best.3 Some  of
these  were  badly  affected  by  the  financial  squeeze  in  1970.  As  a
result, convertible issues as a whole have been subjected to triply
unsettling  influences  in  recent  years,  and  price  variations  have
been  unusually  wide.  In  the  typical  case,  therefore,  the  investor
would  delude  himself  if  he  expected  to  find  in  convertible  issues
that ideal combination of the safety of a high-grade bond and price

wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be found in the
commentary on Chapter 4.

protection plus a chance to benefit from an advance in the price of
the common.

This may be a good place to make a suggestion about the “long-
term bond of the future.” Why should not the effects of changing
interest  rates  be  divided  on  some  practical  and  equitable  basis
between the borrower and the lender? One possibility would be to
sell  long-term  bonds  with  interest  payments  that  vary  with  an
appropriate  index  of  the  going  rate.  The  main  results  of  such  an
arrangement would be: (1) the investor’s bond would always have
a principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit
rating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered
on  conventional  new  issues;  (2)  the  corporation  would  have  the
advantages of long-term debt—being spared problems and costs of
frequent  renewals  of  refinancing—but  its  interest  costs  would
change from year to year.4

Over the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by
an increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability
of principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)
interest  rates?  Or  shall  he  choose  a  fixed-interest  income,  with 
considerable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his princi-
pal  value?  It  would  be  good  for  most  investors  if  they  could 
compromise  between  these  extremes,  and  be  assured  that  neither
their  interest  return  nor  their  principal  value  will  fall  below  a
stated  minimum  over,  say,  a  20-year  period.  This  could  be
arranged, without great difficulty, in an appropriate bond contract
of a new form. Important note: In effect the U.S. government has
done  a  similar  thing  in  its  combination  of  the  original  savings-
bonds contracts with their extensions at higher interest rates. The
suggestion  we  make  here  would  cover  a  longer  fixed  investment
period than the savings bonds, and would introduce more flexibil-
ity in the interest-rate provisions.*

It  is  hardly  worthwhile  to  talk  about  nonconvertible  preferred
stocks, since their special tax status makes the safe ones much more
desirable  holdings  by  corporations—e.g.,  insurance  companies—

Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version of what Gra-
ham is suggesting here.

than by individuals. The poorer-quality ones almost always fluctu-
ate  over  a  wide  range,  percentagewise,  not  too  differently  from
common stocks. We can offer no other useful remark about them.
Table  16-2  below,  p.  406,  gives  some  information  on  the  price
changes of lower-grade nonconvertible preferreds between Decem-
ber 1968 and December 1970. The average decline was 17%, against
11.3% for the S & P composite index of common stocks.

Most of the time, the market is mostly accurate in pricing most stocks.
Millions  of  buyers  and  sellers  haggling  over  price  do  a  remarkably
good job of valuing companies—on average. But sometimes, the price
is not right; occasionally, it is very wrong indeed. And at such times,
you  need  to  understand  Graham’s  image  of  Mr.  Market,  probably 
the  most  brilliant  metaphor  ever  created  for  explaining  how  stocks 
can  become  mispriced.1 The  manic-depressive  Mr.  Market  does  not
always  price  stocks  the  way  an  appraiser  or  a  private  buyer  would
value a business. Instead, when stocks are going up, he happily pays
more than their objective value; and, when they are going down, he is
desperate to dump them for less than their true worth.

Is Mr. Market still around? Is he still bipolar? You bet he is.
On March 17, 2000, the stock of Inktomi Corp. hit a new high of
$231.625. Since they first came on the market in June 1998, shares 
in  the  Internet-searching  software  company  had  gained  roughly
1,900%. Just in the few weeks since December 1999, the stock had
nearly tripled.

What was going on at Inktomi the business that could make Inktomi
the stock so valuable? The answer seems obvious: phenomenally fast

Commentary on Chapter 8

growth. In the three months ending in December 1999, Inktomi sold
$36  million  in  products  and  services,  more  than  it  had  in  the  entire
year  ending  in  December  1998.  If  Inktomi  could  sustain  its  growth
rate of the previous 12 months for just five more years, its revenues
would explode from $36 million a quarter to $5 billion a month. With
such  growth  in  sight,  the  faster  the  stock  went  up,  the  farther  up  it
seemed certain to go.

But in his wild love affair with Inktomi’s stock, Mr. Market was over-
looking  something  about  its  business.  The  company  was  losing
money—lots of it. It had lost $6 million in the most recent quarter, $24
million in the 12 months before that, and $24 million in the year before
that. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in
profits. Yet, on March 17, 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at
a total of $25 billion. (Yes, that’s billion, with a B.)

And then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression.
On  September  30,  2002,  just  two  and  a  half  years  after  hitting
$231.625  per  share,  Inktomi’s  stock  closed  at  25  cents—collapsing
from a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Had
Inktomi’s business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,
the  company  had  generated  $113  million  in  revenues.  So  what  had
changed?  Only  Mr.  Market’s  mood:  In  early  2000,  investors  were 
so  wild  about  the  Internet  that  they  priced  Inktomi’s  shares  at  250
times  the  company’s  revenues.  Now,  however,  they  would  pay  only
0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr.
Hyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool
out of him.

But Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he
had been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.
announced  that  it  would  buy  Inktomi  for  $1.65  per  share.  That  was
nearly seven times Inktomi’s stock price on September 30. History will
probably  show  that  Yahoo!  got  a  bargain.  When  Mr.  Market  makes
stocks  so  cheap,  it’s  no  wonder  that  entire  companies  get  bought
right out from under him.2

2 As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great Depres-
sion caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the value of
their  cash  and  other  liquid  assets,  making  them  “worth  more  dead  than
alive.”

Would you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least five
times a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he feels?
Would you ever agree to be euphoric just because he is—or miserable
just because he thinks you should be? Of course not. You’d insist on
your  right  to  take  control  of  your  own  emotional  life,  based  on  your
experiences  and  your  beliefs.  But,  when  it  comes  to  their  financial
lives, millions of people let Mr. Market tell them how to feel and what to
do—despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can get nuttier
than a fruitcake.

In  1999,  when  Mr.  Market  was  squealing  with  delight,  American
employees directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their
401(k)  retirement  plans.  By  2002,  after  Mr.  Market  had  spent  three
years stuffing stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribu-
tion rate had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%.3 The cheaper
stocks got, the less eager people became to buy them—because they
were imitating Mr. Market, instead of thinking for themselves.

The intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead,
you should do business with him—but only to the extent that it serves
your interests. Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices; your job
is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not
have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.

By refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into
your servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values,
he is creating them elsewhere. In 1999, the Wilshire 5000 index—the
broadest  measure  of  U.S.  stock  performance—gained  23.8%,  pow-
ered by technology and telecommunications stocks. But 3,743 of the
7,234  stocks  in  the  Wilshire  index  went  down  in  value  even  as  the
average  was  rising.  While  those  high-tech  and  telecom  stocks  were
hotter than the hood of a race car on an August afternoon, thousands
of “Old Economy” shares were frozen in the mud—getting cheaper and
cheaper.

start-up firms, went up an astonishing 939.9% in 1999. Meanwhile, Berk-
shire Hathaway—the holding company through which Graham’s greatest
disciple,  Warren  Buffett,  owns  such  Old  Economy  stalwarts  as  Coca-
Cola, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co.—dropped by 24.9%.4

But  then,  as  it  so  often  does,  the  market  had  a  sudden  mood
swing. Figure 8-1 offers a sampling of how the stinkers of 1999 be-
came the stars of 2000 through 2002.

As for those two holding companies, CMGI went on to lose 96% in
2000, another 70.9% in 2001, and still 39.8% more in 2002—a cumulative
loss of 99.3%. Berkshire Hathaway went up 26.6% in 2000 and 6.5% in
2001, then had a slight 3.8% loss in 2002—a cumulative gain of 30%.

CA N YO U B E AT   T H E   P R O S   AT   T H E I R   O W N   G A M E ?

One  of  Graham’s  most  powerful  insights  is  this:  “The  investor  who
permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified mar-
ket declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advan-
tage into a basic disadvantage.”

What does Graham mean by those words “basic advantage”? He
means  that  the  intelligent  individual  investor  has  the  full  freedom  to
choose  whether  or  not  to  follow  Mr.  Market.  You  have  the  luxury  of
being able to think for yourself.5

4 A few months later, on March 10, 2000—the very day that NASDAQ hit its all-
time high—online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he had “repeat-
edly” been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway short, a bet that
Buffett’s stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar thrust of his rhetorical pelvis,
Cramer even declared that Berkshire’s shares were “ripe for the banging.” That
same day, market strategist Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked,
“Norfolk Southern or Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?”
Cisco, a key to tomorrow’s Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over
Norfolk Southern, part of yesterday’s railroad system. (Over the next year, Nor-
folk Southern gained 35%, while Cisco lost 70%.)
5 When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding, Gra-
ham had a concise answer: “The primary cause of failure is that they pay too
much attention to what the stock market is doing currently.” See “Benjamin
Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” [transcript of lecture at Northeast
Missouri State University Business School, March, 1972], Financial History
magazine, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 8.

Commentary on Chapter 8

The typical money manager, however, has no choice but to mimic Mr.
Market’s  every  move—buying  high,  selling  low,  marching  almost  mind-
lessly in his erratic footsteps. Here are some of the handicaps mutual-
fund managers and other professional investors are saddled with:

•

•

• With  billions  of  dollars  under  management,  they  must  gravitate
toward  the  biggest  stocks—the  only  ones  they  can  buy  in  the 
multimillion-dollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus
many funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants.
Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises.
The managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they
already own, driving prices to even more dangerous heights.
If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops,
the managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as
the  funds  are  forced  to  buy  stocks  at  inflated  prices  in  a  rising
market, they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again.
• Many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market, so
they  obsessively  measure  their  returns  against  benchmarks  like
the S & P 500 index. If a company gets added to an index, hun-
dreds of funds compulsively buy it. (If they don’t, and that stock
then  does  well,  the  managers  look  foolish;  on  the  other  hand,  if
they buy it and it does poorly, no one will blame them.)
Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in
medicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric
allergist  and  the  geriatric  otolaryngologist,  fund  managers  must
buy only “small growth” stocks, or only “mid-sized value” stocks,
or nothing but “large blend” stocks.6 If a company gets too big, or
too small, or too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has
to sell it—even if the manager loves the stock.

•

So there’s no reason you can’t do as well as the pros. What you
cannot  do  (despite  all  the  pundits  who  say  you  can)  is  to  “beat  the
pros  at  their  own  game.”  The  pros  can’t  even  win  their  own  game!
Why should you want to play it at all? If you follow their rules, you will
lose—since you will end up as much a slave to Mr. Market as the pro-
fessionals are.

6 Never  mind  what  these  terms  mean,  or  are  supposed  to  mean.  While  in
public  these  classifications  are  treated  with  the  utmost  respect,  in  private
most people in the investment business regard them with the contempt nor-
mally reserved for jokes that aren’t funny.

Commentary on Chapter 8

219

Instead,  recognize  that  investing  intelligently  is  about  controlling
the controllable. You can’t control whether the stocks or funds you buy
will outperform the market today, next week, this month, or this year; in
the short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and
his whims. But you can control:

•
•

•

•

•

•

your brokerage costs, by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply
your  ownership  costs, by  refusing  to  buy  mutual  funds  with
excessive annual expenses
your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your
returns7
your  risk, by  deciding  how  much  of  your  total  assets  to  put  at
hazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing
your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, when-
ever possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains lia-
bility
and, most of all, your own behavior.

If you listen to financial TV, or read most market columnists, you’d
think that investing is some kind of sport, or a war, or a struggle for
survival in a hostile wilderness. But investing isn’t about beating oth-
ers  at  their  game.  It’s  about  controlling  yourself  at  your  own  game.
The challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that
will go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent yourself
from being your own worst enemy—from buying high just because Mr.
Market says “Buy!” and from selling low just because Mr. Market says
“Sell!”

If you investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is
only  one  sensible  approach:  Buy  every  month,  automatically,  and
whenever else you can spare some money. The single best choice for
this lifelong holding is a total stock-market index fund. Sell only when
you need the cash (for a psychological boost, clip out and sign your
“Investment Owner’s Contract”—which you can find on p. 225).

To be  an  intelligent  investor,  you  must  also  refuse  to  judge  your
financial success by how a bunch of total strangers are doing. You’re
not  one  penny  poorer  if  someone  in  Dubuque  or  Dallas  or  Denver

beats the S & P 500 and you don’t. No one’s gravestone reads “HE
BEAT THE MARKET.”

I  once  interviewed  a  group  of  retirees  in  Boca  Raton,  one  of
Florida’s  wealthiest  retirement  communities.  I  asked  these  people—
mostly  in  their  seventies—if  they  had  beaten  the  market  over  their
investing lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no; most weren’t sure.
Then one man said, “Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned
enough for me to end up in Boca.”

Could there be a more perfect answer? After all, the whole point of
investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough
money to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your invest-
ing  success  is  not  by  whether  you’re  beating  the  market  but  by
whether you’ve put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline
that are likely to get you where you want to go. In the end, what mat-
ters isn’t crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making
sure that you do cross it.8

Why, then, do investors find Mr. Market so seductive? It turns out that
our brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble; humans are
pattern-seeking animals. Psychologists have shown that if you present
people  with  a  random  sequence—and  tell  them  that  it’s  unpre-
dictable—they will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what’s coming
next. Likewise, we “know” that the next roll of the dice will be a seven,
that a baseball player is due for a base hit, that the next winning num-
ber  in  the  Powerball  lottery  will  definitely  be  4-27-9-16-42-10—and
that this hot little stock is the next Microsoft.

Groundbreaking  new  research  in  neuroscience  shows  that  our
brains  are  designed  to  perceive  trends  even  where  they  might  not
exist. After an event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of
the human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens
automatically  anticipate  that  it  will  happen  again.  If  it  does  repeat,  a
natural chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with
a  soft  euphoria.  Thus,  if  a  stock  goes  up  a  few  times  in  a  row,  you
reflexively expect it to keep going—and your brain chemistry changes

as the stock rises, giving you a “natural high.” You effectively become
addicted to your own predictions.

But when stocks drop, that financial loss fires up your amygdala—
the part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the
famous “fight or flight” response that is common to all cornered ani-
mals. Just as you can’t keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm
goes off, just as you can’t avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto
your hiking path, you can’t help feeling fearful when stock prices are
plunging.9

In fact, the brilliant psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tver-
sky have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as
intense  as  the  pleasure  of  an  equivalent  gain.  Making  $1,000  on  a
stock feels great—but a $1,000 loss wields an emotional wallop more
than twice as powerful. Losing money is so painful that many people,
terrified at the prospect of any further loss, sell out near the bottom or
refuse to buy more.

That helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market
decline  and  forget  to  put  the  loss  in  proportion.  So,  if  a  TV  reporter
hollers, “The market is plunging—the Dow is down 100 points! ” most
people instinctively shudder. But, at the Dow’s recent level of 8,000,
that’s a drop of just 1.2%. Now think how ridiculous it would sound if,
on a day when it’s 81 degrees outside, the TV weatherman shrieked,
“The  temperature  is  plunging—it’s  dropped  from  81  degrees to 80
degrees! ” That, too, is a 1.2% drop. When you forget to view chang-
ing market prices in percentage terms, it’s all too easy to panic over
minor  vibrations.  (If  you  have  decades  of  investing  ahead  of  you,
there’s a better way to visualize the financial news broadcasts; see the
sidebar on p. 222.)

In the late 1990s, many people came to feel that they were in the
dark  unless  they  checked  the  prices  of  their  stocks  several  times  a
day. But, as Graham puts it, the typical investor “would be better off if
his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared
the  mental  anguish  caused  him  by  other  persons’ mistakes  of  judg-

Stocks are crashing, so you turn on the television to catch the
latest market news. But instead of CNBC or CNN, imagine that
you can tune in to the Benjamin Graham Financial Network. On
BGFN, the audio doesn’t capture that famous sour clang of the
market’s  closing  bell;  the  video  doesn’t  home  in  on  brokers
scurrying  across  the  floor  of  the  stock  exchange  like  angry
rodents. Nor does BGFN run any footage of investors gasping
on frozen sidewalks as red arrows whiz overhead on electronic
stock tickers.

Instead, the image that fills your TV screen is the facade of
the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  festooned  with  a  huge  banner
reading:  “SALE!  50%  OFF!”  As  intro  music,  Bachman-Turner
Overdrive  can  be  heard  blaring  a  few  bars  of  their  old  barn-
burner,  “You  Ain’t  Seen  Nothin’  Yet.”  Then  the  anchorman
announces  brightly,  “Stocks  became  more  attractive  yet  again
today, as the Dow dropped another 2.5% on heavy volume—the
fourth  day  in  a  row that  stocks  have  gotten  cheaper. Tech
investors fared even better, as leading companies like Microsoft
lost nearly 5% on the day, making them even more affordable.
That comes on top of the good news of the past year, in which
stocks have already lost 50%, putting them at bargain levels not
seen in years. And some prominent analysts are optimistic that
prices may drop still further in the weeks and months to come.”
The newscast cuts over to market strategist Ignatz Anderson
of  the  Wall  Street  firm  of  Ketchum  &  Skinner,  who  says,  “My
forecast  is  for  stocks  to  lose  another  15% by  June.  I’m  cau-
tiously optimistic that if everything goes well, stocks could lose
25%, maybe more.”

“Let’s hope Ignatz Anderson is right,” the anchor says cheer-
ily.  “Falling stock  prices  would  be  fabulous news  for  any
investor with a very long horizon. And now over to Wally Wood
for our exclusive AccuWeather forecast.”

ment.” If, after checking the value of your stock portfolio at 1:24  P.M.,
you feel compelled to check it all over again at 1:37 P.M., ask yourself
these questions:

•

•

•

Did  I  call  a  real-estate  agent  to  check  the  market  price  of  my
house at 1:24 P.M.? Did I call back at 1:37 P.M.?
If  I  had,  would  the  price  have  changed?  If  it  did,  would  I  have
rushed to sell my house?
By not checking, or even knowing, the market price of my house
from minute to minute, do I prevent its value from rising over time? 10

The only possible answer to these questions is of course not! And
you should view your portfolio the same way. Over a 10- or 20- or 30-
year investment horizon, Mr. Market’s daily dipsy-doodles simply do not
matter. In any case, for anyone who will be investing for years to come,
falling stock prices are good news, not bad, since they enable you to
buy more for less money. The longer and further stocks fall, and the
more steadily you keep buying as they drop, the more money you will
make in the end—if you remain steadfast until the end. Instead of fear-
ing  a  bear  market,  you  should  embrace  it.  The  intelligent  investor
should be perfectly comfortable owning a stock or mutual fund even if
the stock market stopped supplying daily prices for the next 10 years.11
Paradoxically, “you will be much more in control,” explains neurosci-
entist Antonio Damasio, “if you realize how much you are not in con-
trol.” By acknowledging your biological tendency to buy high and sell
low,  you  can  admit  the  need  to  dollar-cost  average,  rebalance,  and
sign an investment contract. By putting much of your portfolio on per-
manent autopilot, you can fight the prediction addiction, focus on your
long-term financial goals, and tune out Mr. Market’s mood swings.

10 It’s also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your house if its
market  price  was  reported  to  the  last  penny  every  day  in  the  newspapers
and on TV.
11 In a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s, a psychologist at
Columbia  and  Harvard,  Paul  Andreassen,  showed  that  investors  who
received frequent news updates on their stocks earned half the returns of
investors who got no news at all. See Jason Zweig, “Here’s How to Use the
News and Tune Out the Noise,” Money, July, 1998, pp. 63–64.

Although  Graham  teaches  that  you  should  buy  when  Mr.  Market  is
yelling  “sell,”  there’s  one  exception  the  intelligent  investor  needs  to
understand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a
tax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your
realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your
shares)  to  offset  up  to  $3,000  in  ordinary  income.12 Let’s  say  you
bought  200  shares  of  Coca-Cola  stock  in  January  2000  for  $60  a
share—a  total  investment  of  $12,000.  By  year-end  2002,  the  stock
was down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lot—a loss of $3,200.

You  could  have  done  what  most  people  do—either  whine  about
your loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.
Or you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have
sold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after wait-
ing 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of
Coke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your tax-
able  income  by  $3,000  in  2002,  and  you  could  use  the  remaining
$200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would
still own a company whose future you believe in—but now you would
own it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.13

With Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell
and lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logical
by comparison, who are we to complain?

12 Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of Coca-Cola
stock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax code as it stood
in early 2003.
13 This  example  assumes  that  the  investor  had  no  realized  capital  gains  in
2002  and  did  not  reinvest  any  Coke  dividends.  Tax  swaps  are  not  to  be
undertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before doing a tax
swap,  read  IRS  Publication  550  (www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf).  A
good  guide  to  managing  your  investment  taxes  is  Robert  N.  Gordon  with
Jan  M.  Rosen,  Wall  Street  Secrets  for  Tax-Efficient  Investing (Bloomberg
Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 2001). Finally, before you pull the trigger, con-
sult a professional tax adviser.

CHAPTER 9

Investing in Investment Funds

One  course  open  to  the  defensive  investor  is  to  put  his  money
into  investment-company  shares.  Those  that  are  redeemable  on
demand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as
“mutual funds” (or “open-end funds”). Most of these are actively
selling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with
nonredeemable shares are called “closed-end” companies or funds;
the  number  of  their  shares  remains  relatively  constant. All  of  the
funds  of  any  importance  are  registered  with  the  Securities  &
Exchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and
controls.*

The industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were
383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-
lions.  Of  these  356  companies,  with  $50.6  billions,  were  mutual
funds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†

There are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the
broad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they
have a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,
or  “stock-funds”  if  their  holdings  are  nearly  all  common  stocks.
(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge

* It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end
fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has
“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.
† The  fund  industry  has  gone  from  “very  large”  to  immense.  At  year-end
2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-end
funds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFs
with  $109.7  billion.  These  figures  exclude  such  fund-like  investments  as
variable annuities and unit investment trusts.

funds,” “letter-stock funds,” etc.)* Another is by their objectives, as
their primary aim is for income, price stability, or capital apprecia-
tion  (“growth”).  Another  distinction  is  by  their  method  of  sale.
“Load  funds”  add  a  selling  charge  (generally  about  9%  of  asset
value on minimum purchases) to the value before charge.1 Others,
known  as  “no-load”  funds,  make  no  such  charge;  the  manage-
ments are content with the usual investment-counsel fees for han-
dling  the  capital.  Since  they  cannot  pay  salesmen’s  commissions,
the size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.† The buy-
ing  and  selling  prices  of  the  closed-end funds  are  not  fixed  by  the
companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary
corporate stock.

Most of the companies operate under special provisions of the
income-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double
taxation  on  their  earnings.  In  effect,  the  funds  must  pay  out  vir-
tually  all  their  ordinary  income—i.e.,  dividends  and  interest
received, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized
long-term profits on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-
gains dividends”—which are treated by the shareholder as if they
were his own security profits. (There is another option here, which
we omit to avoid clutter.)‡ Nearly all the funds have but one class

* Lists  of  the  major  types  of  mutual  funds  can  be  found  at  www.ici.org/
pdf/g2understanding.pdf  and  http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/
CategoryReturns.html. Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds
are  generally  banned  by  SEC  rules  from  selling  shares  to  any  investor
whose annual income is below $200,000 or whose net worth is below $1
million.
† Today, the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around 5.75%.
If you invest $10,000 in a fund with a flat 5.75% sales load, $575 will go to
the person (and brokerage firm) that sold it to you, leaving you with an initial
net investment of $9,425. The $575 sales charge is actually 6.1% of that
amount,  which  is  why  Graham  calls  the  standard  way  of  calculating  the
charge  a  “sales  gimmick.”  Since  the  1980s,  no-load  funds  have  become
popular, and they no longer tend to be smaller than load funds.
‡ Nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a “regulated investment company,”
or  RIC,  which  is  exempt  from  corporate  income  tax  so  long  as  it 
pays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders. In the “option” that

of security outstanding. A new wrinkle, introduced in 1967, divides
the capitalization into a preferred issue, which will receive all the
ordinary income, and a capital issue, or common stock, which will
receive  all  the  profits  on  security  sales.  (These  are  called  “dual-
purpose funds.”)*

Many of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital
gains concentrate on the purchase of the so-called “growth stocks,”
and they often have the word “growth” in their name. Some spe-
cialize  in  a  designated  area  such  as  chemicals,  aviation,  overseas
investments; this is usually indicated in their titles.

The investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in
fund shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of
choices before him—not too different from those offered in direct
investment.  In  this  chapter  we  shall  deal  with  some  major  ques-
tions, viz:

1. Is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of
better than average results by choosing the right funds? (Subques-
tion: What about the “performance funds”?)†

2.  If  not,  how  can  he  avoid  choosing  funds  that  will  give  him

worse than average results?

3.  Can  he  make  intelligent  choices  between  different  types  of
funds—e.g.,  balanced  versus  all-stock,  open-end  versus  closed-
end, load versus no-load?

Graham omits “to avoid clutter,” a fund can ask the SEC for special permis-
sion  to  distribute  one  of  its  holdings  directly  to  the  fund’s  shareholders—as 
his Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling out shares in GEICO to
Graham-Newman’s own investors. This sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare.
* Dual-purpose  funds,  popular  in  the  late  1980s,  have  essentially  disap-
peared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a more
flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like John
Neff.  Perhaps  the  recent  bear  market  will  lead  to  a  renaissance  of  this
attractive investment vehicle.
† “Performance funds” were all the rage in the late 1960s. They were equiv-
alent  to  the  aggressive  growth  funds  of  the  late  1990s,  and  served  their
investors no better.

Investing in Investment Funds

Investment-Fund Performance as a Whole

Before  trying  to  answer  these  questions  we  should  say  some-
thing about the performance of the fund industry as a whole. Has
it  done  a  good  job  for  its  shareholders?  In  the  most  general  way,
how  have  fund  investors  fared  as  against  those  who  made  their
investments  directly?  We  are  quite  certain  that  the  funds  in  the
aggregate  have  served  a  useful  purpose.  They  have  promoted
good habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-
less  individuals  against  costly  mistakes  in  the  stock  market;  they
have brought their participants income and profits commensurate
with  the  overall  returns  from  common  stocks.  On  a  comparative
basis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who
put  his  money  exclusively  in  investment-fund  shares  in  the  past
ten years has fared better than the average person who made his
common-stock purchases directly.

The  last  point  is  probably  true  even  though  the  actual  perfor-
mance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com-
mon  stocks  as  a  whole,  and  even  though  the  cost  of  investing  in
mutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases.
The  real  choice  of  the  average  individual  has  not  been  between
constructing and acquiring a well-balanced common-stock portfo-
lio or doing the same thing, a bit more expensively, by buying into
the funds. More likely his choice has been between succumbing to
the wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one
hand,  as  against  succumbing  to  the  even  wilier  and  much  more
dangerous  peddlers  of  second-  and  third-rate  new  offerings.  We
cannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a
brokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-
stock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ-
ences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these
temptations should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.

But  how  have  the  investment  funds  performed  as  against  the
general market? This is a somewhat controversial subject, but we
shall  try  to  deal  with  it  in  simple  but  adequate  fashion.  Table  9-1
gives some calculated results for 1961–1970 of our ten largest stock
funds  at  the  end  of  1970,  but  choosing  only  the  largest  one  from
each management group. It summarizes the overall return of each
of  these  funds  for  1961–1965,  1966–1970,  and  for  the  single  years

1969  and  1970.  We  also  give  average  results  based  on  the  sum  of
one share of each of the ten funds. These companies had combined
assets of over $15 billion at the end of 1969, or about one-third of all
the common-stock funds. Thus they should be fairly representative
of the industry as a whole. (In theory, there should be a bias in this
list on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-
ter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion
than the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)

Some interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we
find that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were
not appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-
stock  composite  average  (or  the  S  &  P 425-industrial  stock  aver-
age). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA. (This
raises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA
did  worse  than  the  much  more  numerous  and  apparently  rather
miscellaneous list used by Standard & Poor’s.)* A second point is
that the funds’ aggregate performance as against the S & P index
has improved somewhat in the last five years, compared with the
preceding  five.  The  funds’  gain  ran  a  little  lower  than  S  &  P’s  in
1961–1965 and a little higher than S & P’s in 1966–1970. The third
point is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-
vidual funds.

We do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for
doing  no  better  than  the  market  as  a  whole.  Their  managers  and
their professional competitors administer so large a portion of all
marketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a
whole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their
funds.  (Note  that  the  trust  assets  of  insured  commercial  banks
included  $181  billion  of  common  stocks  at  the  end  of  1969;  if  we
add to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment
advisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must
conclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty
well determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the

* For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500
can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course of the typical investing
lifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their returns have tended to converge
quite closely.

232

movement of the stock averages pretty well determines the funds’
aggregate results.)

Are there better than average funds and can the investor select
these  so  as  to  obtain  superior  results  for  himself?  Obviously  all
investors  could  not  do  this,  since  in  that  case  we  would  soon  be
back where we started, with no one doing better than anyone else.
Let  us  consider  the  question  first  in  a  simplified  fashion.  Why
shouldn’t the investor find out what fund has made the best show-
ing of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume
from this that its management is the most capable and will there-
fore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that
fund? This idea appears the more practicable because, in the case
of the mutual funds, he could obtain this “most capable manage-
ment”  without  paying  any  special  premium  for  it  as  against  the
other funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment corporations the
best-managed  companies  sell  at  correspondingly  high  prices  in
relation to their current earnings and assets.)

The evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years.
But our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the
results shown by the top five performers of 1961–1965 carried over
on the whole through 1966–1970, even though two of this set did not
do  as  well  as  two  of  the  other  five.  Our  studies  indicate  that  the
investor  in  mutual-fund  shares  may  properly  consider  compara-
tive performance over a period of years in the past, say at least five,
provided the data do not represent a large net upward movement of
the  market  as  a  whole.  In  the  latter  case  spectacularly  favorable
results  may  be  achieved  in  unorthodox  ways—as  will  be  demon-
strated  in  our  following  section  on  “performance”  funds.  Such
results in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are
taking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the
time being.

“Performance” Funds

One of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance
of  the  cult  of  “performance”  in  the  management  of  investment
funds  (and  even  of  many  trust  funds).  We  must  start  this  section
with  the  important  disclaimer  that  it  does  not  apply  to  the  large
majority  of  well-established  funds,  but  only  to  a  relatively  small

Investing in Investment Funds

233

section  of  the  industry  which  has  attracted  a  disproportionate
amount of attention. The story is simple enough. Some of those in
charge  set  out  to  get  much  better  than  average  (or  DJIA)  results.
They  succeeded  in  doing  this  for  a  while,  garnering  considerable
publicity and additional funds to manage. The aim was legitimate
enough; unfortunately, it appears that, in the context of investing
really  sizable  funds,  the  aim  cannot  be  accomplished  without
incurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively short time the risks
came home to roost.

Several  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  “performance”
phenomenon  caused  ominous  headshaking  by  those  of  us  whose
experience  went  far  back—even  to  the  1920s—and  whose  views,
for that very reason, were considered old-fashioned and irrelevant
to  this  (second)  “New  Era.”  In  the  first  place,  and  on  this  very
point,  nearly  all  these  brilliant  performers  were  young  men—in
their  thirties  and  forties—whose  direct  financial  experience  was
limited  to  the  all  but  continuous  bull  market  of  1948–1968.  Sec-
ondly, they often acted as if the definition of a “sound investment”
was a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the
next few months. This led to large commitments in newer ventures
at  prices  completely  disproportionate  to  their  assets  or  recorded
earnings. They could be “justified” only by a combination of naïve
hope  in  the  future  accomplishments  of  these  enterprises  with  an
apparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of
the uninformed and greedy public.

This  section  will  not  mention  people’s  names.  But  we  have
every reason to give concrete examples of companies. The “perfor-
mance fund” most in the public’s eye was undoubtedly Manhattan
Fund, Inc., organized at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27
million shares at $9.25 to $10 per share. The company started out
with $247 million of capital. Its emphasis was, of course, on capital
gains. Most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul-
tipliers  of  current  earnings,  paying  no  dividends  (or  very  small
ones),  with  a  large  speculative  following  and  spectacular  price
movements.  The  fund  showed  an  overall  gain  of  38.6%  in  1967,
against 11% for the S & P composite index. But thereafter its perfor-
mance left much to be desired, as is shown in Table 9-2.

The  portfolio  of  Manhattan  Fund  at  the  end  of  1969  was
unorthodox to say the least. It is an extraordinary fact that two of
its largest investments were in companies that filed for bankruptcy
within six months thereafter, and a third faced creditors’ actions in
1971. It is another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of
these  doomed  companies  were  bought  not  only  by  investment
funds but by university endowment funds, the trust departments
of  large  banking  institutions,  and  the  like.* A third  extraordinary
fact  was  that  the  founder-manager  of  Manhattan  Fund  sold  his
stock in a separately organized management company to another
large concern for over $20 million in its stock; at that time the man-
agement  company  sold  had  less  than  $1  million  in  assets.  This  is
undoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between the
results for the “manager” and the “managees.”

A book published at the end of 1969 2 provided profiles of nine-
teen men “who are tops at the demanding game of managing bil-
lions  of  dollars  of  other  people’s  money.”  The  summary  told  us
further that “they are young . . . some earn more than a million dol-
lars  a  year . . . they  are  a  new  financial  breed . . . they  all  have  a
total  fascination  with  the  market . . . and  a  spectacular  knack  for
coming  up  with  winners.”  A fairly  good  idea  of  the  accomplish-
ments  of  this  top  group  can  be  obtained  by  examining  the  pub-
lished results of the funds they manage. Such results are available
for funds directed by twelve of the nineteen persons described in
The  Money  Managers. Typically  enough,  they  showed  up  well  in
1966,  and  brilliantly  in  1967.  In  1968  their  performance  was  still
good  in  the  aggregate,  but  mixed  as  to  individual  funds.  In  1969
they all showed losses, with only one managing to do a bit better
than the S & P composite index. In 1970 their comparative perfor-
mance was even worse than in 1969.

* One of the “doomed companies” Graham refers to was National Student
Marketing  Corp.,  a  con  game  masquerading  as  a  stock,  whose  saga  was
told brilliantly in Andrew Tobias’s The Funny Money Game (Playboy Press,
New York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who were
snookered  by  NSM’s  charismatic  founder,  Cort  Randell,  were  the  endow-
ment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such presti-
gious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.

236

The Intelligent Investor

We have presented this picture in order to point a moral, which
perhaps can best be expressed by the old French proverb: Plus ça
change,  plus  c’est  la  même  chose. Bright,  energetic  people—usually
quite  young—have  promised  to  perform  miracles  with  “other
people’s money” since time immemorial. They have usually been
able to do it for a while—or at least to appear to have done it—and
they  have  inevitably  brought  losses  to  their  public  in  the  end.*
About a half century ago the “miracles” were often accompanied
by  flagrant  manipulation,  misleading  corporate  reporting,  outra-
geous capitalization structures, and other semifraudulent financial
practices. All this brought on an elaborate system of financial con-
trols  by  the  SEC,  as  well  as  a  cautious  attitude  toward  common
stocks on the part of the general public. The operations of the new
“money  managers”  in  1965–1969  came  a  little  more  than  one  full
generation after the shenanigans of 1926–1929.† The specific mal-
practices banned after the 1929 crash were no longer resorted to—
they involved the risk of jail sentences. But in many corners of Wall
Street  they  were  replaced  by  newer  gadgets  and  gimmicks  that
produced very similar results in the end. Outright manipulation of
prices disappeared, but there were many other methods of draw-
ing the gullible public’s attention to the profit possibilities in “hot”
issues.  Blocks  of  “letter  stock” 3 could  be  bought  well  below  the
quoted  market  price,  subject  to  undisclosed  restrictions  on  their
sale; they could immediately be carried in the reports at their full
market value, showing a lovely and illusory profit. And so on. It is

* As only the latest proof that “the more things change, the more they stay
the same,” consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder, launched
the Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a 216% return at
his  previous  dot-com  fund.  Investors  poured  nearly  $300  million  into
Jacob’s  fund  in  the  first  few  weeks  of  2000.  It  then  proceeded  to  lose
79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002—a cumulative collapse of
92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s investors even older and wiser
than it made him.
† Intriguingly,  the  disastrous  boom  and  bust  of  1999–2002  also  came
roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes about
35 years for the investors who remember the last “New Economy” craze to
become less influential than those who do not. If this intuition is correct, the
intelligent investor should be particularly vigilant around the year 2030.

amazing  how,  in  a  completely  different  atmosphere  of  regulation
and prohibitions, Wall Street was able to duplicate so much of the
excesses and errors of the 1920s.

No  doubt  there  will  be  new  regulations  and  new  prohibitions.
The  specific  abuses  of  the  late  1960s  will  be  fairly  adequately
banned from Wall Street. But it is probably too much to expect that
the urge to speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of
that urge can ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the
intelligent  investor  to  know  about  these  “Extraordinary  Popular
Delusions,” 4 and to keep as far away from them as possible.

The picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we
start after their  spectacular  record  in  1967.  With  the  1967  figures
included,  their  overall  showing  is  not  at  all  disastrous.  On  that
basis one of “The Money Managers” operators did quite a bit better
than the S & P composite index, three did distinctly worse, and six
did about the same. Let us take as a check another group of perfor-
mance  funds—the  ten  that  made  the  best  showing  in  1967,  with
gains  ranging  from  84%  up  to  301%  in  that  single  year.  Of  these,
four  gave  a  better  overall  four-year  performance  than  the  S  &  P
index, if the 1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in
1968–1970.  None  of  these  funds  was  large,  and  the  average  size
was  about  $60  million.  Thus,  there  is  a  strong  indication  that
smaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand-
ing results.

The  foregoing  account  contains  the  implicit  conclusion  that
there may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor-
mance  by  investment-fund  managers. All  financial  experience  up
to now indicates that large funds, soundly managed, can produce
at  best  only  slightly  better  than  average  results  over  the  years.  If
they  are  unsoundly  managed  they  can  produce  spectacular,  but
largely illusory, profits for a while, followed inevitably by calami-
tous  losses.  There  have  been  instances  of  funds  that  have  consis-
tently  outperformed  the  market  averages  for,  say,  ten  years  or
more. But these have been scarce exceptions, having most of their
operations  in  specialized  fields,  with  self-imposed  limits  on  the
capital employed—and not actively sold to the public.*

* Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be open-end
funds  that  are  closed  to  new  investors—meaning  that  the  managers  have

238

Closed-End versus Open-End Funds

Almost  all  the  mutual  funds  or  open-end  funds,  which  offer
their holders the right to cash in their shares at each day’s valua-
tion  of  the  portfolio,  have  a  corresponding  machinery  for  selling
new shares. By this means most of them have grown in size over
the  years.  The  closed-end  companies,  nearly  all  of  which  were
organized a long time ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus
have  diminished  in  relative  dollar  importance.  Open-end  compa-
nies are being sold by many thousands of energetic and persuasive
salesmen, the closed-end shares have no one especially interested
in distributing them. Consequently it has been possible to sell most
“mutual  funds”  to  the  public  at  a  fixed  premium  of  about  9%
above  net  asset  value  (to  cover  salesmen’s  commissions,  etc.),
while  the  majority  of  close-end  shares  have  been  consistently
obtainable at less than their asset value. This price discount has var-
ied among individual companies, and the average discount for the
group as a whole has also varied from one date to another. Figures
on this point for 1961–1970 are given in Table 9-3.

It does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower rela-
tive price for closed-end as against open-end shares has very little
to do with the difference in the overall investment results between
the two groups. That this is true is indicated by the comparison of
the  annual  results  for  1961–1970  of  the  two  groups  included  in
Table 9-3.

Thus  we  arrive  at  one  of  the  few  clearly  evident  rules  for
investors’ choices. If you want to put money in investment funds,
buy a group of closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15%
from asset value, instead of paying a premium of about 9% above
asset value for shares of an open-end company. Assuming that the
future dividends and changes in asset values continue to be about
the same for the two groups, you will thus obtain about one-fifth
more for your money from the closed-end shares.

The  mutual-fund  salesman  will  be  quick  to  counter  with  the

stopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the management fees
they can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing shareholders can earn.
Because most fund managers would rather look out for No. 1 than be No. 1,
closing a fund to new investors is a rare and courageous step.

argument: “Ah, but if you own closed-end shares you can never be
sure what price you can sell them for. The discount can be greater
than  it  is  today,  and  you  will  suffer  from  the  wider  spread.  With
our  shares  you  are  guaranteed  the  right  to  turn  in  your  shares  at
100%  of  asset  value,  never  less.”  Let  us  examine  this  argument  a
bit;  it  will  be  a  good  exercise  in  logic  and  plain  common  sense.
Question: Assuming  that  the  discount  on  closed-end  shares  does
widen, how likely is it that you will be worse off with those shares
than with an otherwise equivalent purchase of open-end shares?

This  calls  for  a  little  arithmetic.  Assume  that  Investor  A buys
some open-end shares at 109% of asset value, and Investor B buys
closed-end shares at 85% thereof, plus 11⁄2% commission. Both sets
of shares earn and pay 30% of this asset value in, say, four years,

and  end  up  with  the  same  value  as  at  the  beginning.  Investor A
redeems  his  shares  at  100%  of  value,  losing  the  9%  premium  he
paid.  His  overall  return  for  the  period  is  30%  less  9%,  or  21%  on
asset  value.  This,  in  turn,  is  19%  on  his  investment.  How  much
must Investor B realize on his closed-end shares to obtain the same
return  on  his  investment  as  Investor A?  The  answer  is  73%,  or  a
discount  of  27%  from  asset  value.  In  other  words,  the  closed-end
man  could  suffer  a  widening  of  12  points  in  the  market  discount
(about  double)  before  his  return  would  get  down  to  that  of  the
open-end investor. An adverse change of this magnitude has hap-
pened rarely, if ever, in the history of closed-end shares. Hence it is
very  unlikely  that  you  will  obtain  a  lower  overall  return  from  a
(representative)  closed-end  company,  bought  at  a  discount,  if  its
investment performance is about equal to that of a representative
mutual  fund.  If  a  small-load  (or  no-load)  fund  is  substituted  for
one  with  the  usual  “81⁄2%”  load,  the  advantage  of  the  closed-end
investment is of course reduced, but it remains an advantage.

The  fact  that  a  few  closed-end  funds  are  selling  at  premiums
greater than the true 9% charge on most mutual funds introduces a
separate  question  for  the  investor.  Do  these  premium  companies
enjoy superior management of sufficient proven worth to warrant
their  elevated  prices?  If  the  answer  is  sought  in  the  comparative
results for the past five or ten years, the answer would appear to be
no.  Three  of  the  six  premium  companies  have  mainly  foreign
investments.  A striking  feature  of  these  is  the  large  variation  in

prices in a few years’ time; at the end of 1970 one sold at only one-
quarter of its high, another at a third, another at less than half. If we
consider  the  three  domestic  companies  selling  above  asset  value,
we find that the average of their ten-year overall returns was some-
what better than that of ten discount funds, but the opposite was
true in the last five years. A comparison of the 1961–1970 record of
Lehman Corp. and of General American Investors, two of our old-
est and largest closed-end companies, is given in Table 9-5. One of
these sold 14% above and the other 7.6% below its net-asset value
at the end of 1970. The difference in price to net-asset relationships
did not appear warranted by these figures.

Investment in Balanced Funds

The 23 balanced funds covered in the Wiesenberger Report had
between 25% and 59% of their assets in preferred stocks and bonds,
the  average  being  just  40%.  The  balance  was  held  in  common
stocks.  It  would  appear  more  logical  for  the  typical  investor  to
make his bond-type investments directly, rather than to have them
form  part  of  a  mutual-fund  commitment.  The  average  income
return shown by these balanced funds in 1970 was only 3.9% per
annum on asset value, or say 3.6% on the offering price. The better
choice  for  the  bond  component  would  be  the  purchase  of  United
States savings bonds, or corporate bonds rated A or better, or tax-
free bonds, for the investor’s bond portfolio.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 9

The schoolteacher asks Billy Bob: “If you have twelve 
sheep and one jumps over the fence, how many sheep do 
you have left?”

Billy Bob answers, “None.”
“Well,” says the teacher, “you sure don’t know your 

subtraction.”

“Maybe not,” Billy Bob replies, “but I darn sure know 

my sheep.”

A purely American creation, the mutual fund was introduced in 1924
by a former salesman of aluminum pots and pans named Edward G.
Leffler. Mutual funds are quite cheap, very convenient, generally diver-
sified,  professionally  managed,  and  tightly  regulated  under  some  of
the toughest provisions of Federal securities law. By making investing
easy and affordable for almost anyone, the funds have brought some
54 million American families (and millions more around the world) into
the  investing  mainstream—probably  the  greatest  advance  in  financial
democracy ever achieved.

But mutual funds aren’t perfect; they are almost perfect, and that
word  makes  all  the  difference.  Because  of  their  imperfections,  most
funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax
headaches,  and  suffer  erratic  swings  in  performance.  The  intelligent
investor must choose funds with great care in order to avoid ending
up owning a big fat mess.

Most investors simply buy a fund that has been going up fast, on the
assumption  that  it  will  keep  on  going.  And  why  not?  Psychologists
have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the
long  run  can  be  predicted  from  even  a  short  series  of  outcomes.
What’s more, we know from our own experience that some plumbers
are far better than others, that some baseball players are much more
likely to hit home runs, that our favorite restaurant serves consistently
superior food, and that smart kids get consistently good grades. Skill
and brains and hard work are recognized, rewarded—and consistently
repeated—all  around  us.  So,  if  a  fund  beats  the  market,  our  intuition
tells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming.

Unfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than
skill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at 
just the right time, he will look brilliant—but all too often, what was hot
suddenly  goes  cold  and  the  manager’s  IQ  seems  to  shrivel  by  50 
points. Figure 9-1 shows what happened to the hottest funds of 1999.
This is yet another reminder that the market’s hottest market sec-
tor—in 1999, that was technology—often turns as cold as liquid nitro-
gen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning.1 And it’s a reminder
that buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the
stupidest  things  an  investor  can  do.  Financial  scholars  have  been
studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they
are virtually unanimous on several points:

•

•
•

the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome
its costs of researching and trading them;
the higher a fund’s expenses, the lower its returns;
the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to
earn;

1 Sector  funds  specializing  in  almost  every  imaginable  industry  are  avail-
able—and date back to the 1920s. After nearly 80 years of history, the evi-
dence is overwhelming: The most lucrative, and thus most popular, sector of
any given year often turns out to be among the worst performers of the fol-
lowing year. Just as idle hands are the devil’s workshop, sector funds are the
investor’s nemesis.

highly volatile funds, which bounce up and down more than aver-
age, are likely to stay volatile;
funds  with  high  past  returns  are  unlikely  to  remain  winners  for
long.2

Your chances of selecting the top-performing funds of the future on
the basis of their returns in the past are about as high as the odds that
Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman will both show up in pink ballet
slippers at your next cocktail party. In other words, your chances are
not zero—but they’re pretty close. (See sidebar, p. 255.)

But there’s good news, too. First of all, understanding why it’s so
hard  to  find  a  good  fund  will  help  you  become  a  more  intelligent
investor. Second, while past performance is a poor predictor of future
returns, there are other factors that you can use to increase your odds
of finding a good fund. Finally, a fund can offer excellent value even if it
doesn’t beat the market—by providing an economical way to diversify
your holdings and by freeing up your time for all the other things you
would rather be doing than picking your own stocks.

Why don’t more winning funds stay winners?

The better a fund performs, the more obstacles its investors face:
Migrating  managers. When  a  stock  picker  seems  to  have  the
Midas  touch,  everyone  wants  him—including  rival  fund  companies. 
If  you  bought  Transamerica  Premier  Equity  Fund  to  cash  in  on  the
skills of Glen Bickerstaff, who gained 47.5% in 1997, you were quickly
out  of  luck;  TCW  snatched  him  away  in  mid-1998  to  run  its  TCW
Galileo  Select  Equities  Fund,  and  the  Transamerica  fund  lagged 
the  market  in  three  of  the  next  four  years.  If  you  bought  Fidelity
Aggressive  Growth  Fund  in  early  2000  to  capitalize  on  the  high
returns  of  Erin  Sullivan,  who  had  nearly  tripled  her  shareholders’
money since 1997, oh well: She quit to start her own hedge fund in

2000, and her former fund lost more than three-quarters of its value
over the next three years.3

Asset  elephantiasis. When  a  fund  earns  high  returns,  investors
notice—often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of
weeks.  That  leaves  the  fund  manager  with  few  choices—all  of  them
bad.  He  can  keep  that  money  safe  for  a  rainy  day,  but  then  the  low
returns on cash will crimp the fund’s results if stocks keep going up.
He  can  put  the  new  money  into  the  stocks  he  already  owns—which
have  probably  gone  up  since  he  first  bought  them  and  will  become
dangerously overvalued if he pumps in millions of dollars more. Or he
can buy new stocks he didn’t like well enough to own already—but he
will have to research them from scratch and keep an eye on far more
companies than he is used to following.

Finally, when the $100-million Nimble Fund puts 2% of its assets
(or $2 million) in Minnow Corp., a stock with a total market value of
$500 million, it’s buying up less than one-half of 1% of Minnow. But if
hot performance swells the Nimble Fund to $10 billion, then an invest-
ment  of  2%  of  its  assets  would  total  $200  million—nearly  half  the
entire value of Minnow, a level of ownership that isn’t even permissible
under  Federal  law.  If  Nimble’s  portfolio  manager  still  wants  to  own
small stocks, he will have to spread his money over vastly more com-
panies—and probably end up spreading his attention too thin.

No more fancy footwork. Some companies specialize in “incubat-
ing”  their  funds—test-driving  them  privately  before  selling  them  pub-
licly.  (Typically,  the  only  shareholders  are  employees  and  affiliates  of
the fund company itself.) By keeping them tiny, the sponsor can use
these  incubated  funds  as  guinea  pigs  for  risky  strategies  that  work
best with small sums of money, like buying truly tiny stocks or rapid-fire
trading of initial public offerings. If its strategy succeeds, the fund can
lure  public  investors  en  masse  by  publicizing  its  private  returns.  In
other cases, the fund manager “waives” (or skips charging) manage-
ment fees, raising the net return—then slaps the fees on later after the
high returns attract plenty of customers. Almost without exception, the
returns of incubated and fee-waived funds have faded into mediocrity
after outside investors poured millions of dollars into them.

3 That’s not to say that these funds would have done better if their “super-
star” managers had stayed in place; all we can be sure of is that the two
funds did poorly without them.

Rising expenses. It often costs more to trade stocks in very large
blocks than in small ones; with fewer buyers and sellers, it’s harder to
make a match. A fund with $100 million in assets might pay 1% a year
in trading costs. But, if high returns send the fund mushrooming up to
$10 billion, its trades could easily eat up at least 2% of those assets.
The typical fund holds on to its stocks for only 11 months at a time, so
trading costs eat away at returns like a corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the
other costs of running a fund rarely fall—and sometimes even rise—as
assets  grow.  With  operating  expenses  averaging  1.5%,  and  trading
costs  at  around  2%,  the  typical  fund  has  to  beat  the  market  by  3.5
percentage points per year before costs just to match it after costs!

Sheepish behavior. Finally, once a fund becomes successful, its
managers  tend  to  become  timid  and  imitative.  As  a  fund  grows,  its
fees  become  more  lucrative—making  its  managers  reluctant  to  rock
the boat. The very risks that the managers took to generate their initial
high returns could now drive investors away—and jeopardize all that fat
fee  income.  So  the  biggest  funds  resemble  a  herd  of  identical  and
overfed  sheep,  all  moving  in  sluggish  lockstep,  all  saying  “baaaa”  at
the  same  time.  Nearly  every  growth  fund  owns  Cisco  and  GE  and
Microsoft  and  Pfizer  and  Wal-Mart—and  in  almost  identical  propor-
tions. This behavior is so prevalent that finance scholars simply call it
herding.4 But by protecting their own fee income, fund managers com-
promise  their  ability  to  produce  superior  returns  for  their  outside
investors.

4 There’s  a  second  lesson  here:  To  succeed,  the  individual  investor  must
either avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that have already
been picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far more patiently.

FIGURE 9-2 The Funnel of Fund Performance

Looking back from December 31, 2002, how many U.S. stock
funds outperformed Vanguard 500 Index Fund?

One year:
1,186 of 2,423 funds (or 48.9%)

Three years:
1,157 of 1,944 funds (or 59.5%)

Five years:
768 of 1,494 funds (or 51.4%)

Ten years:
227 of 728 funds (or 31.2%)

Fifteen years:
125 of 445 funds (or 28.1%)

Twenty years:
37 of 248 funds (or 14.9%)

Because of their fat costs and bad behavior, most funds fail to earn
their keep. No wonder high returns are nearly as perishable as unre-
frigerated fish. What’s more, as time passes, the drag of their exces-
sive expenses leaves most funds farther and farther behind, as Figure
9.2 shows.5

What, then, should the intelligent investor do?
First of all, recognize that an index fund—which owns all the stocks

5 Amazingly, this illustration understates the advantage of index funds, since
the  database  from  which  it  is  taken  does  not  include  the  track  records  of
hundreds  of  funds  that  disappeared  over  these  periods.  Measured  more
accurately, the advantage of indexing would be overpowering.

in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to select
the “best” and avoid the “worst”—will beat most funds over the long
run.  (If  your  company  doesn’t  offer  a  low-cost  index  fund  in  your
401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its
rock-bottom  overhead—operating  expenses  of  0.2%  annually,  and
yearly trading costs of just 0.1%—give the index fund an insurmount-
able advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over
the  next  20  years,  a  low-cost  index  fund  like  Vanguard  Total  Stock
Market will return just under 6.7%. (That would turn a $10,000 invest-
ment  into  more  than  $36,000.)  But  the  average  stock  fund,  with 
its 1.5% in operating expenses and roughly 2% in trading costs, will
be  lucky  to  gain  3.5%  annually.  (That  would  turn  $10,000  into  just
under  $20,000—or  nearly  50%  less than  the  result  from  the  index
fund.)

Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. You’ll
never be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the
top-performing fund in the country. You’ll never be able to boast that
you beat the market, because the job of an index fund is to match the
market’s return, not to exceed it. Your index-fund manager is not likely
to “roll the dice” and gamble that the next great industry will be tele-
portation,  or  scratch-’n’-sniff  websites,  or  telepathic  weight-loss  clin-
ics; the fund will always own every stock, not just one manager’s best
guess at the next new thing. But, as the years pass, the cost advan-
tage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly. Hold an index fund for
20 years or more, adding new money every month, and you are all but
certain  to  outperform  the  vast  majority  of  professional  and  individual
investors alike. Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best
choice for individual investors, as does Warren Buffett.6

Street, Seymour Chatman, ed. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996), p. 273, and
Janet Lowe, The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the
Wall Street Legend (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), p. 273. As War-
ren  Buffett  wrote  in  his  1996  annual  report:  “Most  investors,  both  institu-
tional  and  individual,  will  find  that  the  best  way  to  own  common  stocks  is
through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path
are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the
great  majority  of  investment  professionals.”  (See  www.berkshirehathaway.

When you add up all their handicaps, the wonder is not that so few
funds beat the index, but that any do. And yet, some do. What quali-
ties do they have in common?

Their  managers  are  the  biggest  shareholders. The  conflict  of
interest between what’s best for the fund’s managers and what’s best
for  its  investors  is  mitigated  when  the  managers  are  among  the
biggest owners of the fund’s shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Part-
ners, even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own
funds. At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers
own so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money
as if it were their own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let
the funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A
fund’s proxy statement and Statement of Additional Information, both
available from the Securities and Exchange Commission through the
EDGAR  database  at  www.sec.gov,  disclose  whether  the  managers
own at least 1% of the fund’s shares.

They are cheap. One of the most common myths in the fund busi-
ness is that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best
justification  for  higher  fees.  There  are  two  problems  with  this  argu-
ment. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that funds
with higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns
are temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If
you buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful
of  cold  ashes—but  your  costs  of  owning  the  fund  are  almost  certain
not to decline when its returns do.

They dare to be different. When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he
bought  whatever  seemed  cheap  to  him—regardless  of  what  other  fund
managers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;
right  after  that,  he  made  Chrysler  his  top  holding,  even  though  most
experts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put
almost  20%  of  Fidelity  Magellan  in  foreign  stocks  like  Honda,  Norsk
Hydro, and Volvo. So, before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the hold-
ings listed in its latest report against the roster of the S & P 500 index; if
they look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum, shop for another fund.7

They shut the door. The best funds often close to new investors—
permitting only their existing shareholders to buy more. That stops the
feeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and pro-
tects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis. It’s also a signal
that  the  fund  managers  are  not  putting  their  own  wallets  ahead  of
yours.  But  the  closing  should  occur  before—not  after—the  fund
explodes in size. Some companies with an exemplary record of shut-
ting their own gates are Longleaf, Numeric, Oakmark, T. Rowe Price,
Vanguard, and Wasatch.

They don’t advertise. Just as Plato says in The Republic that the ideal
rulers are those who do not want to govern, the best fund managers often
behave as if they don’t want your money. They don’t appear constantly on
financial television or run ads boasting of their No. 1 returns. The steady lit-
tle Mairs & Power Growth Fund didn’t even have a website until 2001 and
still sells its shares in only 24 states. The Torray Fund has never run a retail
advertisement since its launch in 1990.

What  else  should  you  watch  for?  Most  fund  buyers  look  at  past
performance first, then at the manager’s reputation, then at the riski-
ness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund’s expenses.8

The intelligent investor looks at those same things—but in the oppo-

site order.

Since a fund’s expenses are far more predictable than its future risk
or return, you should make them your first filter. There’s no good rea-
son ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses,
by fund category:

•
•
•

Taxable and municipal bonds:
U.S. equities (large and mid-sized stocks):
High-yield ( junk) bonds:

0.75%
1.0%

Next, evaluate risk. In its prospectus (or buyer’s guide), every fund
must show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quar-
ter. If you can’t stand losing at least that much money in three months,
go elsewhere. It’s also worth checking a fund’s Morningstar rating. A
leading investment research firm, Morningstar awards “star ratings” to
funds,  based  on  how  much  risk  they  took  to  earn  their  returns  (one
star is the worst, five is the best). But, just like past performance itself,
these  ratings  look  back  in  time;  they  tell  you  which  funds  were  the
best, not which are going to be. Five-star funds, in fact, have a discon-
certing habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first find
a low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be
different,  don’t  hype  their  returns,  and  have  shown  a  willingness  to
shut  down  before  they  get  too  big  for  their  britches.  Then,  and  only
then, consult their Morningstar rating.10

Finally, look at past performance, remembering that it is only a pale
predictor of future returns. As we’ve already seen, yesterday’s winners
often  become  tomorrow’s  losers.  But  researchers  have  shown  that
one thing is almost certain: Yesterday’s losers almost never become
tomorrow’s  winners.  So  avoid  funds  with  consistently  poor  past
returns—especially if they have above-average annual expenses.

equity  funds,  many  of  them  tiny,  trading  only  a  few  hundred  shares 
a  day,  with  high  expenses  and  weird  strategies  (like  Morgan  Fun-
Shares,  which  specializes  in  the  stocks  of  “habit-forming”  industries
like  booze,  casinos,  and  cigarettes).  Research  by  closed-end  fund
expert  Donald  Cassidy  of  Lipper  Inc.  reinforces  Graham’s  earlier
observations: Diversified closed-end stock funds trading at a discount
not only tend to outperform those trading at a premium but are likely 
to  have  a  better  return  than  the  average  open-end  mutual  fund. 
Sadly,  however,  diversified  closed-end  stock  funds  are  not  always
available  at  a  discount  in  what  has  become  a  dusty,  dwindling 
market.11

But there are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially
strong  choices  available  in  the  municipal-bond  area.  When  these
funds  trade  at  a  discount,  their  yield  is  amplified  and  they  can  be
attractive, so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds
listed above.12

The  new  breed  of  exchange-traded  index  funds  can  be  worth
exploring  as  well.  These  low-cost  “ETFs”  sometimes  offer  the  only
means by which an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market like,
say, companies  based  in  Belgium  or  stocks  in  the  semiconductor
industry. Other index ETFs offer much broader market exposure. How-
ever,  they  are  generally  not  suitable  for  investors  who  wish  to  add
money  regularly,  since  most  brokers  will  charge  a  separate  commis-
sion on every new investment you make.13

11 Unlike  a  mutual  fund,  a  closed-end  fund  does  not  issue  new  shares
directly  to  anyone  who  wants  to  buy  them.  Instead,  an  investor  must  buy
shares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is willing
to part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates above and below
their net asset value, depending on supply and demand.
12 For  more  information,  see  www.morningstar.com  and  www.etfconnect.

13 Unlike index mutual funds, index ETFs are subject to standard stock com-
missions  when  you  buy  and  sell  them—and  these  commissions  are  often
assessed on any additional purchases or reinvested dividends. Details are

Once  you  own  a  fund,  how  can  you  tell  when  it’s  time  to  sell? 
The standard advice is to ditch a fund if it underperforms the market
(or  similar  portfolios)  for  one—or  is  it  two?—or  is  it  three?—years  in 
a  row.  But  this  advice  makes  no  sense.  From  its  birth  in  1970 
through  1999,  the  Sequoia  Fund  underperformed  the  S  &  P  500
index  in  12  out  of  its  29  years—or  more  than  41%  of  the  time.  Yet
Sequoia gained more than 12,500% over that period, versus 4,900%
for the index.14

The performance of most funds falters simply because the type of
stocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. If you hired a manager
to invest in a particular way, why fire him for doing what he promised?
By selling when a style of investing is out of fashion, you not only lock
in  a  loss  but  lock  yourself  out  of  the  all-but-inevitable  recovery.  One
study  showed  that  mutual-fund  investors  underperformed  their  own
funds  by  4.7  percentage  points  annually  from  1998  through  2001—
simply by buying high and selling low.15

So when should you sell? Here a few definite red flags:

•

•

•
•

a sharp and unexpected change in strategy, such as a “value”
fund loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a “growth” fund
buying tons of insurance stocks in 2002;
an increase in expenses, suggesting that the managers are lin-
ing their own pockets;
large and frequent tax bills generated by excessive trading;
suddenly erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund
generates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain).

14 See  Sequoia’s  June  30,  1999,  report  to  shareholders  at  www.sequoia
fund.com/Reports/Quarterly/SemiAnn99.htm. Sequoia has been closed to
new investors since 1982, which has reinforced its superb performance.

Believing—or even just hoping—that we can pick the best funds
of the future makes us feel better. It gives us the pleasing sensa-
tion that we are in charge of our own investment destiny. This
“I’m-in-control-here”  feeling  is  part  of  the  human  condition;  it’s
what  psychologists  call  overconfidence.  Here  are  just  a  few
examples of how it works:

•

In  1999,  Money Magazine  asked  more  than  500  people
whether their portfolios had beaten the market. One in four
said yes. When asked to specify their returns, however, 80%
of  those  investors  reported  gains  lower than  the  market’s.
(Four  percent  had  no  idea  how  much  their  portfolios  rose—
but were sure they had beaten the market anyway!)

•

• A Swedish study asked drivers who had been in severe car
crashes to rate their own skills behind the wheel. These peo-
ple—including some the police had found responsible for the
accidents  and  others  who  had  been  so  badly  injured  that
they  answered  the  survey  from  their  hospital  beds—insisted
they were better-than-average drivers.
In a poll taken in late 2000, Time and CNN asked more than
1,000 likely voters whether they thought they were in the top
1%  of  the  population  by  income.  Nineteen  percent  placed
themselves among the richest 1% of Americans.
In  late  1997,  a  survey  of  750  investors  found  that  74%
believed their mutual-fund holdings would “consistently beat
the  Standard  &  Poor’s  500  each  year”—even  though  most
funds fail to beat the S & P 500 in the long run and many fail
to beat it in any year.1

•

While this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psy-
che, that doesn’t make it good investment policy. It makes sense
to  believe  you  can  predict  something  only  if  it  actually  is pre-
dictable. Unless you are realistic, your quest for self-esteem will
end up in self-defeat.

As the investment consultant Charles Ellis puts it, “If you’re not pre-
pared to stay married, you shouldn’t get married.” 16 Fund investing is
no different. If you’re not prepared to stick with a fund through at least
three lean years, you shouldn’t buy it in the first place. Patience is the
fund investor’s single most powerful ally.

CHAPTER 10

The Investor and His Advisers

The investment of money in securities is unique among business
operations  in  that  it  is  almost  always  based  in  some  degree  on
advice received from others. The great bulk of investors are ama-
teurs. Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can
profit by professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent
in the very concept of investment advice.

If  the  reason  people  invest  is  to  make  money,  then  in  seeking
advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That
idea  has  some  element  of  naïveté.  Businessmen  seek  professional
advice  on  various  elements  of  their  business,  but  they  do  not
expect to be told how to make a profit. That is their own bailiwick.
When they, or nonbusiness people, rely on others to make invest-
ment profits for them, they are expecting a kind of result for which
there is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs.

If we assume that there are normal or standard income results to
be obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the
adviser  can  be  more  readily  established.  He  will  use  his  superior
training and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and
to make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is
entitled.  It  is  when  the  investor  demands  more  than  an  average
return on his money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better
for  him,  that  the  question  arises  whether  more  is  being  asked  or
promised than is likely to be delivered.

Advice  on  investments  may  be  obtained  from  a  variety  of
sources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowl-
edgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a broker-
age  firm  or  investment  banking  house;  (4)  a  financial  service  or

257

258

The Intelligent Investor

periodical;  and  (5)  an  investment  counselor.*  The  miscellaneous
character of this list suggests that no logical or systematic approach
in this matter has crystallized, as yet, in the minds of investors.

Certain  common-sense  considerations  relate  to  the  criterion  of
normal  or  standard  results  mentioned  above.  Our  basic  thesis  is
this: If the investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in han-
dling his funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers
strictly to standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of
investment, or he must have an unusually intimate and favorable
knowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other
channels. But if the ordinary business or professional relationship
exists between the investor and his advisers, he can be receptive to
less conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has
grown  in  knowledge  and  experience  and  has  therefore  become
competent to pass independent judgment on the recommendations
of  others.  He  has  then  passed  from  the  category  of  defensive  or
unenterprising  investor  into  that  of  aggressive  or  enterprising
investor.

Investment Counsel and Trust Services of Banks

The  truly  professional  investment  advisers—that  is,  the  well-
established  investment  counsel  firms,  who  charge  substantial
annual  fees—are  quite  modest  in  their  promises  and  pretentions.
For the most part they place their clients’ funds in standard inter-
est- and dividend-paying securities, and they rely mainly on nor-
mal  investment  experience  for  their  overall  results.  In  the  typical
case it is doubtful whether more than 10% of the total fund is ever
invested in securities other than those of leading companies, plus

* The list of sources for investment advice remains as “miscellaneous” as it
was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors conducted in late 2002 for
the  Securities  Industry  Association,  a  Wall  Street  trade  group,  found  that
17% of investors depended most heavily for investment advice on a spouse
or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a broker; 10% on financial periodicals;
and 24% on a financial planner. The only difference from Graham’s day is
that  8%  of  investors  now  rely  heavily  on  the  Internet  and  3%  on  financial
television. (See www.sia.com.)

government bonds (including state and municipal issues); nor do
they make a serious effort to take advantage of swings in the gen-
eral market.

The  leading  investment-counsel  firms  make  no  claim  to  being
brilliant; they do pride themselves on being careful, conservative,
and  competent.  Their  primary  aim  is  to  conserve  the  principal
value over the years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate
of income. Any accomplishment beyond that—and they do strive
to  better  the  goal—they  regard  in  the  nature  of  extra  service  ren-
dered.  Perhaps  their  chief  value  to  their  clients  lies  in  shielding
them  from  costly  mistakes.  They  offer  as  much  as  the  defensive
investor  has  the  right  to  expect  from  any  counselor  serving  the
general public.

What  we  have  said  about  the  well-established  investment-
counsel firms applies generally to the trust and advisory services of
the larger banks.*

Financial Services

The so-called financial services are organizations that send out
uniform  bulletins  (sometimes  in  the  form  of  telegrams)  to  their
subscribers.  The  subjects  covered  may  include  the  state  and
prospects  of  business,  the  behavior  and  prospect  of  the  securities
markets, and information and advice regarding individual issues.
There  is  often  an  “inquiry  department”  which  will  answer  que-
stons  affecting  an  individual  subscriber.  The  cost  of  the  service
averages much less than the fee that investment counselors charge
their  individual  clients.  Some  organizations—notably  Babson’s
and  Standard  &  Poor’s—operate  on  separate  levels  as  a  financial
service  and  as  investment  counsel.  (Incidentally,  other  organiza-

* The  character  of  investment  counseling  firms  and  trust  banks  has  not
changed,  but  today  they  generally  do  not  offer  their  services  to  investors
with  less  than  $1  million  in  financial  assets;  in  some  cases,  $5  million  or
more  is  required.  Today  thousands  of  independent  financial-planning  firms
perform very similar functions, although (as analyst Robert Veres puts it) the
mutual fund has replaced blue-chip stocks as the investment of choice and
diversification has replaced “quality” as the standard of safety.

260

The Intelligent Investor

tions—such  as  Scudder,  Stevens  &  Clark—operate  separately  as
investment counsel and as one or more investment funds.)

The financial services direct themselves, on the whole, to a quite
different  segment  of  the  public  than  do  the  investment-counsel
firms.  The  latters’  clients  generally  wish  to  be  relieved  of  bother
and  the  need  for  making  decisions.  The  financial  services  offer
information  and  guidance  to  those  who  are  directing  their  own
financial  affairs  or  are  themselves  advising  others.  Many  of  these
services confine themselves exclusively, or nearly so, to forecasting
market movements by various “technical” methods. We shall dis-
miss these with the observation that their work does not concern
“investors” as the term is used in this book.

On the other hand, some of the best known—such as Moody’s
Investment  Service  and  Standard  &  Poor’s—are  identified  with
statistical  organizations  that  compile  the  voluminous  statistical
data that form the basis for all serious security analysis. These ser-
vices have a varied clientele, ranging from the most conservative-
minded  investor  to  the  rankest  speculator. As  a  result  they  must
find it difficult to adhere to any clear-cut or fundamental philoso-
phy in arriving at their opinions and recommendations.

An old-established service of the type of Moody’s and the others
must obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of
investors. What is it? Basically they address themselves to the mat-
ters  in  which  the  average  active  investor-speculator  is  interested,
and their views on these either command some measure of author-
ity or at least appear more reliable than those of the unaided client.
For years the financial services have been making stock-market
forecasts  without  anyone  taking  this  activity  very  seriously.  Like
everyone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes
wrong. Wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid
the  risk  of  being  proved  completely  wrong.  (There  is  a  well-
developed art of Delphic phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to
whatever  the  future  brings.)  In  our  view—perhaps  a  prejudiced
one—this segment of their work has no real significance except for
the  light  it  throws  on  human  nature  in  the  securities  markets.
Nearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by
someone  else  what  he  thinks  the  market  is  going  to  do.  The
demand being there, it must be supplied.

Their  interpretations  and  forecasts  of  business  conditions,  of

The Investor and His Advisers

261

course, are much more authoritative and informing. These are an
important part of the great body of economic intelligence which is
spread  continuously  among  buyers  and  sellers  of  securities  and
tends  to  create  fairly  rational  prices  for  stocks  and  bonds  under
most  circumstances.  Undoubtedly  the  material  published  by  the
financial services adds to the store of information available and for-
tifies the investment judgment of their clients.

It  is  difficult  to  evaluate  their  recommendations  of  individual
securities. Each service is entitled to be judged separately, and the
verdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive
study covering many years. In our own experience we have noted
among them a pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair
what could otherwise be more useful advisory work. This is their
general  view  that  a  stock  should  be  bought  if  the  near-term
prospects of the business are favorable and should be sold if these
are  unfavorable—regardless  of  the  current  price. Such  a  superficial
principle often prevents the services from doing the sound analyti-
cal  job  of  which  their  staffs  are  capable—namely,  to  ascertain
whether a given stock appears over- or undervalued at the current
price in the light of its indicated long-term future earning power.

The intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on
the basis of recommendations received from a financial service. Once
this point is established, the role of the financial service then becomes
the useful one of supplying information and offering suggestions.

Advice from Brokerage Houses

Probably  the  largest  volume  of  information  and  advice  to  the
security-owning public comes from stockbrokers. These are mem-
bers  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  and  of  other  exchanges, 
who execute buying and selling orders for a standard commission.
Practically  all  the  houses  that  deal  with  the  public  maintain  a 
“statistical”  or  analytical  department,  which  answers  inquiries 
and makes recommendations. A great deal of analytical literature,
some  of  it  elaborate  and  expensive,  is  distributed  gratis  to  the
firms’ customers—more impressively referred to as clients.

A great  deal  is  at  stake  in  the  innocent-appearing  question
whether “customers” or “clients” is the more appropriate name. A
business has customers; a professional person or organization has

262

clients. The Wall Street brokerage fraternity has probably the high-
est  ethical  standards  of  any  business, but  it  is  still  feeling  its  way
toward the standards and standing of a true profession.*

In  the  past  Wall  Street  has  thrived  mainly  on  speculation,  and
stock-market  speculators  as  a  class  were  almost  certain  to  lose
money.  Hence  it  has  been  logically  impossible  for  brokerage
houses  to  operate  on  a  thoroughly  professional  basis.  To  do  that
would have required them to direct their efforts toward reducing
rather than increasing their business.

The  farthest  that  certain  brokerage  houses  have  gone  in  that
direction—and could have been expected to go—is to refrain from
inducing  or  encouraging  anyone  to  speculate.  Such  houses  have
confined themselves to executing orders given them, to supplying
financial  information  and  analyses,  and  to  rendering  opinions  on
the investment merits of securities. Thus, in theory at least, they are
devoid  of  all  responsibility  for  either  the  profits  or  the  losses  of
their speculative customers.†

Most  stock-exchange  houses,  however,  still  adhere  to  the  old-
time  slogans  that  they  are  in  business  to  make  commissions  and
that the way to succeed in business is to give the customers what
they  want.  Since  the  most  profitable  customers  want  speculative
advice  and  suggestions,  the  thinking  and  activities  of  the  typical
firm are pretty closely geared to day-to-day trading in the market.
Thus  it  tries  hard  to  help  its  customers  make  money  in  a  field
where they are condemned almost by mathematical law to lose in
the end.‡ By this we mean that the speculative part of their opera-
tions  cannot  be  profitable  over  the  long  run  for  most  brokerage-

* Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall Street has
ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly cynical enough. Wall
Street  may  have  higher  ethical  standards  than  some businesses  (smug-
gling,  prostitution,  Congressional  lobbying,  and  journalism  come  to  mind)
but  the  investment  world  nevertheless  has  enough  liars,  cheaters,  and
thieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks frantically busy for decades to come.
† The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the belief
that Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable advice have
learned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this point.
‡ Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham was directing
at full-service brokers, ended up applying to discount Internet brokers in the

house  customers.  But  to  the  extent  that  their  operations  resemble
true investing they may produce investment gains that more than
offset the speculative losses.

The  investor  obtains  advice  and  information  from  stock-
exchange  houses  through  two  types  of  employees,  now  known
officially  as  “customers’  brokers”  (or  “account  executives”)  and
financial analysts.

The customer’s broker, also called a “registered representative,”
formerly  bore  the  less  dignified  title  of  “customer’s  man.”  Today
he is for the most part an individual of good character and consid-
erable knowledge of securities, who operates under a rigid code of
right conduct. Nevertheless, since his business is to earn commis-
sions,  he  can  hardly  avoid  being  speculation-minded.  Thus  the
security buyer who wants to avoid being influenced by speculative
considerations will ordinarily have to be careful and explicit in his
dealing with his customer’s broker; he will have to show clearly, by
word and deed, that he is not interested in anything faintly resem-
bling  a  stock-market  “tip.”  Once  the  customer’s  broker  under-
stands  clearly  that  he  has  a  real  investor  on  his  hands,  he  will
respect this point of view and cooperate with it.

The  financial  analyst,  formerly  known  chiefly  as  security  ana-
lyst, is a person of particular concern to the author, who has been
one  himself  for  more  than  five  decades  and  has  helped  educate
countless  others. At  this  stage  we  refer  only  to  the  financial  ana-
lysts employed by brokerage houses. The function of the security
analyst  is  clear  enough  from  his  title.  It  is  he  who  works  up  the
detailed studies of individual securities, develops careful compar-
isons of various issues in the same field, and forms an expert opin-
ion  of  the  safety  or  attractiveness  or  intrinsic  value  of  all  the
different kinds of stocks and bonds.

late 1990s. These firms spent millions of dollars on flashy advertising that
goaded their customers into trading more and trading faster. Most of those
customers ended up picking their own pockets, instead of paying someone
else to do it for them—and the cheap commissions on that kind of transac-
tion are a poor consolation for the result. More traditional brokerage firms,
meanwhile,  began  emphasizing  financial  planning  and  “integrated  asset
management,”  instead  of  compensating  their  brokers  only  on  the  basis  of
how many commissions they could generate.

264

By what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal
requirements  for  being  a  security  analyst.  Contrast  with  this  the
facts that a customer’s broker must pass an examination, meet the
required  character  tests,  and  be  duly  accepted  and  registered  by
the New York Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, nearly all the
younger analysts have had extensive business-school training, and
the oldsters have acquired at least the equivalent in the school of
long experience. In the great majority of cases, the employing bro-
kerage house can be counted on to assure itself of the qualifications
and competence of its analysts.*

The customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security
analysts directly, or his contact may be an indirect one via the cus-
tomer’s broker. In either case the analyst is available to the client
for a considerable amount of information and advice. Let us make
an emphatic statement here. The value of the security analyst to the
investor  depends  largely  on  the  investor’s  own  attitude.  If  the
investor  asks  the  analyst  the  right  questions,  he  is  likely  to  get 
the  right—or  at  least  valuable—answers.  The  analysts  hired  by
brokerage  houses,  we  are  convinced,  are  greatly  handicapped  by
the general feeling that they are supposed to be market analysts as
well.  When  they  are  asked  whether  a  given  common  stock  is
“sound,” the question often means, “Is this stock likely to advance
during the next few months?” As a result many of them are com-

* This  remains  true,  although  many  of Wall  Street’s  best  analysts  hold  the
title of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is awarded by the
Association of Investment Management & Research (formerly the Financial
Analysts Federation) only after the candidate has completed years of rigor-
ous study and passed a series of difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts
worldwide have been certified as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor
Stanley  Block  found  that  most  CFAs  ignore  Graham’s  teachings:  Growth
potential ranks higher than quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in
determining  P/E  ratios,  while  far  more  analysts  base  their  buy  ratings  on
recent  price  than  on  the  long-term  outlook  for  the  company.  See  Stanley
Block, “A Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Ana-
lysts  Journal, July/August,  1999,  at  www.aimrpubs.org.  As  Graham  was
fond  of  saying,  his  own  books  have  been  read  by—and  ignored  by—more
people than any other books in finance.

pelled to analyze with one eye on the stock ticker—a pose not con-
ducive to sound thinking or worthwhile conclusions.*

In the next section of this book we shall deal with some of the con-
cepts and possible achievements of security analysis. A great many
analysts  working  for  stock  exchange  firms  could  be  of  prime  assis-
tance to the bona fide investor who wants to be sure that he gets full
value for his money, and possibly a little more. As in the case of the
customers’ brokers, what is needed at the beginning is a clear under-
standing by the analyst of the investor’s attitude and objectives. Once
the analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is value-
minded  rather  than  quotation-minded,  there  is  an  excellent  chance
that his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit.

The CFA Certificate for Financial Analysts

An important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional
standing and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of
chartered  financial  analyst  (CFA)  is  now  awarded  to  those  senior
practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests
of fitness.1 The subjects covered include security analysis and port-
folio  management.  The  analogy  with  the  long-established  profes-
sional  title  of  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  is  evident  and
intentional. This relatively new apparatus of recognition and con-
trol should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and
eventually to place their work on a truly professional basis.†

* It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere commoners to
contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility of institutional investors
are permitted to approach the throne of the almighty Wall Street analyst. An indi-
vidual  investor  might,  perhaps,  have  some  luck  calling  analysts  who  work  at
“regional” brokerage firms headquartered outside of New York City. The investor
relations area at the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a
list  of  analysts  who  follow  the  stock.  Websites  like  www.zacks.com  and
www.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the intelligent
investor  should  remember  that  most  analysts  do  not  analyze  businesses.
Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock prices.

program, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became a reality.

Dealings with Brokerage Houses

One  of  the  most  disquieting  developments  of  the  period  in
which  we  write  this  revision  has  been  the  financial  embarrass-
ment—in plain words, bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy—of quite a
few New York Stock Exchange firms, including at least two of con-
siderable size.* This is the first time in half a century or more that
such  a  thing  has  happened,  and  it  is  startling  for  more  than  one
reason. For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been
moving  in  the  direction  of  closer  and  stricter  controls  over  the
operations and financial condition of its members—including min-
imum  capital  requirements,  surprise  audits,  and  the  like.  Besides
this, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their
members  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  Finally, 
the  stock-brokerage  industry  itself  has  operated  under  favorable
conditions—namely,  a  huge  increase  in  volume,  fixed  minimum
commission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-
ited number of member firms.

The  first  financial  troubles  of  the  brokerage  houses  (in  1969)
were  attributed  to  the  increase  in  volume  itself.  This,  it  was
claimed,  overtaxed  their  facilities,  increased  their  overhead,  and
produced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should
be  pointed  out  this  was  probably  the  first  time  in  history  that
important  enterprises  have  gone  broke  because  they  had  more
business  than  they  could  handle.  In  1970,  as  brokerage  failures
increased, they were blamed chiefly on “the falling off in volume.”
A strange  complaint  when  one  reflects  that  the  turnover  of  the

* The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan
& Co. and Goodbody & Co. Du Pont (founded by the heirs to the chemical
fortune)  was  saved  from  insolvency  in  1970  only  after  Texas  entrepreneur 
H. Ross Perot lent more than $50 million to the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-
largest brokerage firm in the United States, would have failed in late 1970
had  Merrill  Lynch  not  acquired  it.  Hayden,  Stone  &  Co.  would  also  have
gone under if it had not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven bro-
kerage  firms  went  bust.  The  farcical  story  of  Wall  Street’s  frenzied  over-
expansion in the late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go
Years (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999).

The Investor and His Advisers

267

NYSE in 1970 totaled 2,937 million shares, the largest volume in its
history  and  well  over  twice  as  large  as  in  any  year  before  1965.
During the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual
volume  had  averaged  “only”  712  million  shares—one  quarter  of
the 1970 figure—but the brokerage business had enjoyed the great-
est prosperity in its history. If, as it appears, the member firms as a
whole had allowed their overhead and other expenses to increase
at  a  rate  that  could  not  sustain  even  a  mild  reduction  in  volume
during part of a year, this does not speak well for either their busi-
ness acumen or their financial conservatism.

A third explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out
of a mist of concealment, and we suspect that it is the most plausi-
ble and significant of the three. It seems that a good part of the cap-
ital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common
stocks  owned  by  the  individual  partners.  Some  of  these  seem  to
have been highly speculative and carried at inflated values. When
the  market  declined  in  1969  the  quotations  of  such  securities  fell
drastically  and  a  substantial  part  of  the  capital  of  the  firms  van-
ished with them.2 In effect the partners were speculating with the
capital  that  was  supposed  to  protect  the  customers  against  the
ordinary  financial  hazards  of  the  brokerage  business,  in  order  to
make  a  double  profit  thereon.  This  was  inexcusable;  we  refrain
from saying more.

The investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating
his  financial  policies  but  also  in  the  associated  details.  These
include the choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders. Up to
now  it  was  sufficient  to  counsel  our  readers  to  deal  only  with  a
member  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  unless  he  had  com-
pelling  reasons  to  use  a  nonmember  firm.  Reluctantly,  we  must
add some further advice in this area. We think that people who do
not  carry  margin  accounts—and  in  our  vocabulary  this  means all
nonprofessional investors—should have the delivery and receipt of
their securities handled by their bank. When giving a buying order
to  your  brokers  you  can  instruct  them  to  deliver  the  securities
bought  to  your  bank  against  payment  therefor  by  the  bank;  con-
versely,  when  selling  you  can  instruct  your  bank  to  deliver  the
securities to the broker against payment of the proceeds. These ser-
vices  will  cost  a  little  extra  but  they  should  be  well  worth  the
expense in terms of safety and peace of mind. This advice may be

268

The Intelligent Investor

disregarded, as no longer called for, after the investor is sure that
all  the  problems  of  stock-exchange  firms  have  been  disposed  of,
but not before.*

Investment Bankers

The term “investment banker” is applied to a firm that engages
to  an  important  extent  in  originating,  underwriting,  and  selling
new issues of stocks and bonds. (To underwrite means to guaran-
tee to the issuing corporation, or other issuer, that the security will
be fully sold.) A number of the brokerage houses carry on a certain
amount of underwriting activity. Generally this is confined to par-
ticipating  in  underwriting  groups  formed  by  leading  investment
bankers.  There  is  an  additional  tendency  for  brokerage  firms  to
originate and sponsor a minor amount of new-issue financing, par-
ticularly  in  the  form  of  smaller  issues  of  common  stocks  when  a
bull market is in full swing.

Investment banking is perhaps the most respectable department
of the Wall Street community, because it is here that finance plays
its constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of
industry. In fact, much of the theoretical justification for maintain-
ing  active  stock  markets,  notwithstanding  their  frequent  specula-
tive  excesses,  lies  in  the  fact  that  organized  security  exchanges
facilitate the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks. If investors or
speculators could not expect to see a ready market for a new secu-
rity offered them, they might well refuse to buy it.

The  relationship  between  the  investment  banker  and  the

* Nearly  all  brokerage  transactions  are  now  conducted  electronically,  and
securities are no longer physically “delivered.” Thanks to the establishment
of  the  Securities  Investor  Protection  Corporation,  or  SIPC,  in  1970,
investors are generally assured of recovering their full account values if their
brokerage firm becomes insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consor-
tium of brokers; all the members agree to pool their assets to cover losses
incurred by the customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s pro-
tection eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.

The Investor and His Advisers

269

investor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer.
For many years past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar
value has consisted of bond issues that were purchased in the main
by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. In
this business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd
and experienced buyers. Hence any recommendations made by the
investment  bankers  to  these  customers  have  had  to  pass  careful
and  skeptical  scrutiny.  Thus  these  transactions  are  almost  always
effected on a businesslike footing.

But  a  different  situation  obtains  in  a  relationship  between  the
individual security buyer and the investment banking firms, includ-
ing the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is
frequently  inexperienced  and  seldom  shrewd.  He  is  easily  influ-
enced  by  what  the  salesman  tells  him,  especially  in  the  case  of 
common-stock issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying
is  chiefly  to  make  a  quick  profit.  The  effect  of  all  this  is  that  the
public investor’s protection lies less in his own critical faculty than
in the scruples and ethics of the offering houses.3

It is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting
firms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles
of adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust
himself  to  the  judgment  of  the  seller.  In  1959  we  stated  at  this 
point: “The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves
recurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the
sale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-
tion.” Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed. As
already  pointed  out,  the  years  1960–61  and,  again,  1968–69  were
marked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual-
ity, sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many
cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi-
manipulation. A number of the more important Wall Street houses
have participated to some degree in these less than creditable activ-
ities,  which  demonstrates  that  the  familiar  combination  of  greed,
folly, and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the financial
scene.

The intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and rec-
ommendations  received  from  investment  banking  houses,  espe-
cially those known by him to have an excellent reputation; but he
will  be  sure  to  bring  sound  and  independent  judgment  to  bear

270

The Intelligent Investor

upon these suggestions—either his own, if he is competent, or that
of some other type of adviser.*

Other Advisers

It is a good old custom, especially in the smaller towns, to con-
sult  one’s  local  banker  about  investments.  A commercial  banker
may  not  be  a  thoroughgoing  expert  on  security  values,  but  he  is
experienced  and  conservative.  He  is  especially  useful  to  the
unskilled investor, who is often tempted to stray from the straight
and unexciting path of a defensive policy and needs the steadying
influence  of  a  prudent  mind.  The  more  alert  and  aggressive
investor, seeking counsel in the selection of security bargains, will
not ordinarily find the commercial banker’s viewpoint to be espe-
cially suited to his own objectives.†

We take a more critical attitude toward the widespread custom
of asking investment advice from relatives or friends. The inquirer
always  thinks  he  has  good  reason  for  assuming  that  the  person
consulted has superior knowledge or experience. Our own obser-
vation indicates that it is almost as difficult to select satisfactory lay
advisers as it is to select the proper securities unaided. Much bad
advice is given free.

Summary

Investors who are prepared to pay a fee for the management of
their  funds  may  wisely  select  some  well-established  and  well-
recommended  investment-counsel  firm.  Alternatively,  they  may
use  the  investment  department  of  a  large  trust  company  or  the
supervisory service supplied on a fee basis by a few of the leading
New York Stock Exchange houses. The results to be expected are in
no wise exceptional, but they are commensurate with those of the
average well-informed and cautious investor.

* Those who heeded Graham’s advice would not have been suckered into
buying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.
† This traditional role of bankers has for the most part been supplanted by
accountants, lawyers, or financial planners.

271

Most security buyers obtain advice without paying for it specifi-
cally. It stands to reason, therefore, that in the majority of cases they
are not entitled to and should not expect better than average results.
They should be wary of all persons, whether customers’ brokers or
security salesmen, who promise spectacular income or profits. This
applies both to the selection of securities and to guidance in the elu-
sive (and perhaps illusive) art of trading in the market.

Defensive  investors,  as  we  have  defined  them,  will  not  ordi-
narily be equipped to pass independent judgment on the security
recommendations  made  by  their  advisers.  But  they  can  be
explicit—and even repetitiously so—in stating the kind of securi-
ties they want to buy. If they follow our prescription they will con-
fine  themselves  to  high-grade  bonds  and  the  common  stocks  of
leading  corporations,  preferably  those  that  can  be  purchased  at
individual price levels that are not high in the light of experience
and analysis. The security analyst of any reputable stock-exchange
house can make up a suitable list of such common stocks and can
certify to the investor whether or not the existing price level there-
for is a reasonably conservative one as judged by past experience.

The aggressive investor will ordinarily work in active coopera-
tion  with  his  advisers.  He  will  want  their  recommendations
explained in detail, and he will insist on passing his own judgment
upon them. This means that the investor will gear his expectations
and the character of his security operations to the development of
his own knowledge and experience in the field. Only in the excep-
tional  case,  where  the  integrity  and  competence  of  the  advisers
have been thoroughly demonstrated, should the investor act upon
the  advice  of  others  without  understanding  and  approving  the
decision made.

There  have  always  been  unprincipled  stock  salesmen  and  fly-
by-night  stock  brokers,  and—as  a  matter  of  course—we  have
advised our readers to confine their dealings, if possible, to mem-
bers of the New York Stock Exchange. But we are reluctantly com-
pelled  to  add  the  extra-cautious  counsel  that  security  deliveries
and payments be made through the intermediary of the investor’s
bank.  The  distressing  Wall  Street  brokerage-house  picture  may
have cleared up completely in a few years, but in late 1971 we still
suggest, “Better safe than sorry.”

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 10

I feel grateful to the Milesian wench who, seeing the philoso-
pher Thales continually spending his time in contemplation of
the heavenly vault and always keeping his eyes raised upward,
put something in his way to make him stumble, to warn him 
that it would be time to amuse his thoughts with things in the
clouds when he had seen to those at his feet. Indeed she 
gave him or her good counsel, to look rather to himself than 
to the sky.

—Michel de Montaigne

D O Y O U N E E D   H E L P ?

In the glory days of the late 1990s, many investors chose to go it alone.
By doing their own research, picking stocks themselves, and placing
their trades through an online broker, these investors bypassed Wall
Street’s costly infrastructure of research, advice, and trading. Unfortu-
nately, many do-it-yourselfers asserted their independence right before
the worst bear market since the Great Depression—making them feel,
in the end, that they were fools for going it alone. That’s not necessar-
ily true, of course; people who delegated every decision to a traditional
stockbroker lost money, too.

But many investors do take comfort from the experience, judgment,
and second opinion that a good financial adviser can provide. Some
investors may need an outsider to show them what rate of return they
need  to  earn  on  their  investments,  or  how  much  extra  money  they
need to save, in order to meet their financial goals. Others may simply
benefit from having someone else to blame when their investments go
down;  that  way,  instead  of  beating  yourself  up  in  an  agony  of  self-
doubt, you get to criticize someone who typically can defend him or
herself and encourage you at the same time. That may provide just the
psychological  boost  you  need  to  keep  investing  steadily  at  a  time

when other investors’ hearts may fail them. All in all, just as there’s no

matters  whether  you  blew  it  by  being  lazy,  reckless,  or  just  unlucky;
after such a giant loss, your portfolio is crying out for help.

Busted  budgets. If  you  perennially  struggle  to  make  ends  meet,
have no idea where your money goes, find it impossible to save on a
regular  schedule,  and  chronically  fail  to  pay  your  bills  on  time,  then
your finances are out of control. An adviser can help you get a grip on
your money by designing a comprehensive financial plan that will out-
line how—and how much—you should spend, borrow, save, and invest.
Chaotic portfolios. All too many investors thought they were diver-
sified  in  the  late  1990s  because  they  owned  39  “different”  Internet
stocks,  or  seven  “different”  U.S.  growth-stock  funds.  But  that’s  like
thinking  that  an  all-soprano  chorus  can  handle  singing  “Old  Man
River” better than a soprano soloist can. No matter how many sopra-
nos you add, that chorus will never be able to nail all those low notes
until some baritones join the group. Likewise, if all your holdings go up
and down together, you lack the investing harmony that true diversifi-
cation brings. A professional “asset-allocation” plan can help.

Major  changes. If  you’ve  become  self-employed  and  need  to  set
up a retirement plan, your aging parents don’t have their finances in
order, or college for your kids looks unaffordable, an adviser can not
only provide peace of mind but help you make genuine improvements
in  the  quality  of  your  life.  What’s  more,  a  qualified  professional  can
ensure that you benefit from and comply with the staggering complex-
ity of the tax laws and retirement rules.

your financial future in the hands of an adviser, it’s imperative that you
find someone who not only makes you comfortable but whose honesty
is beyond reproach. As Ronald Reagan used to say, “Trust, then ver-
ify.” Start off by thinking of the handful of people you know best and
trust the most. Then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom they
trust  and  who,  they  feel,  delivers  good  value  for  his  fees.  A  vote  of
confidence from someone you admire is a good start.2

Once you have the name of the adviser and his firm, as well as his
specialty—is  he  a  stockbroker?  financial  planner?  accountant?  insur-
ance agent?—you can begin your due diligence. Enter the name of the
adviser and his or her firm into an Internet search engine like Google
to  see  if  anything  comes  up  (watch  for  terms  like  “fine,”  “complaint,”
“lawsuit,”  “disciplinary  action,”  or  “suspension”).  If  the  adviser  is  a
stockbroker  or  insurance  agent,  contact  the  office  of  your  state’s
securities  commissioner  (a  convenient  directory  of  online  links  is  at
www.nasaa.org) to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer
complaints have been filed against the adviser.3 If you’re considering
an accountant who also functions as a financial adviser, your state’s
accounting regulators (whom you can find through the National Asso-
ciation  of  State  Boards  of  Accountancy  at  www.nasba.org)  will  tell
you whether his or her record is clean.

Financial planners (or their firms) must register with either the U.S.
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  or  securities  regulators  in  the
state  where  their  practice  is  based.  As  part  of  that  registration,  the 
adviser must file a two-part document called Form ADV. You should be
able  to  view  and  download  it  at  www.advisorinfo.sec.gov,  www.iard.
com,  or  the  website  of  your  state  securities  regulator.  Pay  special 
attention to the Disclosure Reporting Pages, where the adviser must
disclose  any  disciplinary  actions  by  regulators.  (Because  unscrupu-

to find a fee-only financial planner through www.napfa.org (or www.feeonly.
org),  whose  members  are  generally  held  to  high  standards  of  service  and
integrity.
3 By itself, a customer complaint is not enough to disqualify an adviser from
your consideration; but a persistent pattern of complaints is. And a discipli-
nary  action  by  state  or  Federal  regulators  usually  tells  you  to  find  another
adviser. Another source for checking a broker’s record is http://pdpi.nasdr.

lous advisers have been known to remove those pages before hand-
ing an ADV to a prospective client, you should independently obtain
your own complete copy.) It’s a good idea to cross-check a financial
planner’s  record  at  www.cfp-board.org,  since  some  planners  who 
have been disciplined outside their home state can fall through the reg-
ulatory cracks. For more tips on due diligence, see the sidebar below.

The  need  for  due  diligence  doesn’t  stop  once  you  hire  an
adviser.  Melanie  Senter  Lubin,  securities  commissioner  for  the
State  of  Maryland,  suggests  being  on  guard  for  words  and
phrases  that  can  spell  trouble.  If  your  adviser  keeps  saying
them—or  twisting  your  arm  to  do  anything  that  makes  you
uncomfortable—“then  get  in  touch  with  the  authorities  very
quickly,” warns Lubin. Here’s the kind of lingo that should set off
warning bells:

“offshore”
“the opportunity of a

lifetime”
“prime bank”
“This baby’s gonna

“guaranteed”
“You need to hurry.”
“It’s a sure thing.”

A leading financial-planning newsletter recently canvassed dozens of
advisers to get their thoughts on how you should go about interview-
ing them.4 In screening an adviser, your goals should be to:

•

•

•

determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just
goes through the motions
establish whether he or she understands the fundamental princi-
ples of investing as they are outlined in this book
assess  whether  he  or  she  is  sufficiently  educated,  trained,  and
experienced to help you.

Here  are  some  of  the  questions  that  prominent  financial  planners

recommended any prospective client should ask:

Why are you in this business? What is the mission statement of your
firm? Besides your alarm clock, what makes you get up in the morning?
What  is  your  investing  philosophy?  Do  you  use  stocks  or  mutual
funds? Do you use technical analysis? Do you use market timing? (A
“yes” to either of the last two questions is a “no” signal to you.)

Do you focus solely on asset management, or do you also advise
on taxes, estate and retirement planning, budgeting and debt manage-
ment,  and  insurance?  How  do  your  education,  experience,  and  cre-
dentials qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice? 5

What  needs  do  your  clients  typically  have  in  common?  How  can
you  help  me  achieve  my  goals?  How  will  you  track  and  report  my
progress?  Do  you  provide  a  checklist  that  I  can  use  to  monitor  the
implementation of any financial plan we develop?

4 Robert  Veres,  editor  and  publisher  of  the  Inside  Information newsletter,
generously shared these responses for this book. Other checklists of ques-
tions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and www.napfa.org.
5 Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has taken
and passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other “alphabet soup”
of credentials brandished by financial planners, including the “CFM” or the
“CMFC,” signify very little.) More important, by contacting the organization
that awards the credential, you can verify his record and check that he has
not been disciplined for violations of rules or ethics.

How do you choose investments? What investing approach do you
believe is most successful, and what evidence can you show me that
you have achieved that kind of success for your clients? What do you
do  when  an  investment  performs  poorly  for  an  entire  year?  (Any
adviser who answers “sell” is not worth hiring.)

Do you, when recommending investments, accept any form of com-
pensation from any third party? Why or why not? Under which circum-
stances? How much, in actual dollars, do you estimate I would pay for
your services the first year? What would make that number go up or
down over time? (If fees will consume more than 1% of your assets
annually, you should probably shop for another adviser.6)

How many clients do you have, and how often do you communicate
with  them?  What  has  been  your  proudest  achievement  for  a  client?
What characteristics do your favorite clients share? What’s the worst
experience you’ve had with a client, and how did you resolve it? What
determines  whether  a  client  speaks  to  you  or  to  your  support  staff?
How long do clients typically stay with you?

Can I see a sample account statement? (If you can’t understand it,
ask  the  adviser  to  explain  it.  If  you  can’t  understand  his  explanation,
he’s not right for you.)

Do you consider yourself financially successful? Why? How do you

define financial success?

How high an average annual return do you think is feasible on my

investments? (Anything over 8% to10% is unrealistic.)

Will you provide me with your résumé, your Form ADV, and at least
three references? (If the adviser or his firm is required to file an ADV,
and he will not provide you a copy, get up and leave—and keep one
hand on your wallet as you go.)

Have you ever had a formal complaint filed against you? Why did

the last client who fired you do so?

6 If  you  have  less  than  $100,000  to  invest,  you  may  not  be  able  to  find  a
financial adviser who will take your account. In that case, buy a diversified
basket of low-cost index funds, follow the behavioral advice throughout this
book, and your portfolio should eventually grow to the level at which you can
afford an adviser.

Finally, bear in mind that great financial advisers do not grow on trees.
Often, the best already have as many clients as they can handle—and
may be willing to take you on only if you seem like a good match. So
they will ask you some tough questions as well, which might include:

Why do you feel you need a financial adviser?
What are your long-term goals?
What has been your greatest frustration in dealing with other advis-

ers (including yourself)?

Do you have a budget? Do you live within your means? What per-

centage of your assets do you spend each year?

When  we  look  back  a  year  from  now,  what  will  I  need  to  have

accomplished in order for you to be happy with your progress?

How do you handle conflicts or disagreements?
How did you respond emotionally to the bear market that began in

2000?

What are your worst financial fears? Your greatest financial hopes?
What  rate  of  return  on  your  investments  do  you  consider  reason-

able? (Base your answer on Chapter 3.)

An  adviser  who  doesn’t  ask  questions  like  these—and  who  does
not show enough interest in you to sense intuitively what other ques-
tions you consider to be the right ones—is not a good fit.

Above all else, you should trust your adviser enough to permit him
or  her  to  protect  you  from  your  worst  enemy—yourself.  “You  hire  an
adviser,”  explains  commentator  Nick  Murray,  “not  to  manage  money
but to manage you.”

“If  the  adviser  is  a  line  of  defense  between  you  and  your  worst
impulsive  tendencies,”  says  financial-planning  analyst  Robert  Veres,
“then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of
you control them.” Among those systems:

•

•

•

a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn,
save, spend, borrow, and invest your money;
an investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental
approach to investing;
an asset-allocation  plan that  details  how  much  money  you  will
keep in different investment categories.

Commentary on Chapter 10

279

These  are  the  building  blocks  on  which  good  financial  decisions
must  be  founded,  and  they  should  be  created  mutually—by  you  and
the adviser—rather than imposed unilaterally. You should not invest a
dollar or make a decision until you are satisfied that these foundations
are in place and in accordance with your wishes.

Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: 

General Approach

Financial analysis is now a well-established and flourishing pro-
fession,  or  semiprofession.  The  various  societies  of  analysts  that
make up the National Federation of Financial Analysts have over
13,000  members,  most  of  whom  make  their  living  out  of  this
branch of mental activity. Financial analysts have textbooks, a code
of  ethics,  and  a  quarterly  journal.*  They  also  have  their  share  of
unresolved problems. In recent years there has been a tendency to
replace the general concept of “security analysis” by that of “finan-
cial  analysis.”  The  latter  phrase  has  a  broader  implication  and  is
better suited to describe the work of most senior analysts on Wall
Street.  It  would  be  useful  to  think  of  security  analysis  as  limiting
itself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and
bonds, whereas financial analysis would comprise that work, plus
the determination of investment policy (portfolio selection), plus a
substantial  amount  of  general  economic  analysis.1 In  this  chapter
we  shall  use  whatever  designation  is  most  applicable,  with  chief
emphasis on the work of the security analyst proper.

The  security  analyst  deals  with  the  past,  the  present,  and  the
future  of  any  given  security  issue.  He  describes  the  business;  he
summarizes  its  operating  results  and  financial  position;  he  sets
forth its strong and weak points, its possibilities and risks; he esti-
mates its future earning power under various assumptions, or as a

* The  National  Federation  of  Financial  Analysts  is  now  the  Association  for
Investment Management and Research; its “quarterly” research publication,
the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every other month.

“best guess.” He makes elaborate comparisons of various compa-
nies, or of the same company at various times. Finally, he expresses
an opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment-
grade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it
is a common stock.

In doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a
number  of  techniques,  ranging  from  the  elementary  to  the  most
abstruse.  He  may  modify  substantially  the  figures 
in  the
company’s  annual  statements,  even  though  they  bear  the  sacred
imprimatur of the certified public accountant. He is on the lookout
particularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal
more or less than they say.

The security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by
which  we  can  conclude  whether  a  given  bond  or  preferred  stock
may  be  termed  sound  enough  to  justify  purchase  for  investment.
These standards relate primarily to past average earnings, but they
are  concerned  also  with  capital  structure,  working  capital,  asset
values, and other matters.

In  dealing  with  common  stocks  the  security  analyst  until
recently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined
as  were  his  standards  of  safety  for  bonds  and  preferred  stocks.
Most of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-
formances, a more or less general forecast of the future—with par-
ticular  emphasis  on  the  next  12  months—and  a  rather  arbitrary
conclusion. The latter was, and still is, often drawn with one eye on
the  stock  ticker  or  the  market  charts.  In  the  past  few  years,  how-
ever,  much  attention  has  been  given  by  practicing  analysts  to  the
problem of valuing growth stocks. Many of these have sold at such
high prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec-
ommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur-
chase  by  fairly  definite  projections  of  expected  earnings  running
fairly  far  into  the  future.  Certain  mathematical  techniques  of  a
rather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the
valuations arrived at.

We shall deal with these techniques, in foreshortened form, a lit-
tle later. However, we must point out a troublesome paradox here,
which  is  that  the  mathematical  valuations  have  become  most
prevalent precisely in those areas where one might consider them
least  reliable.  For  the  more  dependent  the  valuation  becomes  on

282

The Intelligent Investor

anticipations  of  the  future—and  the  less  it  is  tied  to  a  figure
demonstrated  by  past  performance—the  more  vulnerable  it
becomes to possible miscalculation and serious error. A large part
of  the  value  found  for  a  high-multiplier  growth  stock  is  derived
from  future  projections  which  differ  markedly  from  past  perfor-
mance—except  perhaps  in  the  growth  rate  itself.  Thus  it  may  be
said  that  security  analysts  today  find  themselves  compelled  to
become  most  mathematical  and  “scientific”  in  the  very  situations
which lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment.*

Let  us  proceed,  nonetheless,  with  our  discussion  of  the  more
important elements and techniques of security analysis. The pres-
ent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non-
professional investor. At the minimum he should understand what
the security analyst is talking about and driving at; beyond that, he
should be equipped, if possible, to distinguish between superficial
and sound analysis.

Security analysis for the lay investor is thought of as beginning

* The  higher  the  growth  rate  you  project,  and  the  longer  the  future  period
over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast becomes to the
slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a company earning $1 per
share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the next 15 years, its earnings
would end up at $8.14. If the market values the company at 35 times earn-
ings, the stock would finish the period at roughly $285. But if earnings grow
at 14% instead of 15%, the company would earn $7.14 at the end of the
period—and, in the shock of that shortfall, investors would no longer be will-
ing  to  pay  35  times  earnings.  At,  say,  20  times  earnings,  the  stock  would
end up around $140 per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced
mathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process
of foreseeing the future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who
claims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems.
As Graham put it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have
never seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or
related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you
could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute
theory for experience, and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive
guise of investment.” (See p. 570.)

with the interpretation of a company’s annual financial report. This
is a subject which we have covered for laymen in a separate book,
entitled The  Interpretation  of  Financial  Statements.2 We do  not  con-
sider  it  necessary  or  appropriate  to  traverse  the  same  ground  in
this chapter, especially since the emphasis in the present book is on
principles  and  attitudes  rather  than  on  information  and  descrip-
tion. Let us pass on to two basic questions underlying the selection
of investments. What are the primary tests of safety of a corporate
bond  or  preferred  stock?  What  are  the  chief  factors  entering  into
the valuation of a common stock?

Bond Analysis

The most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of
security analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of bond
issues  and  investment-grade  preferred  stocks.  The  chief  criterion
used for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest
charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in
the past. In the case of preferred stocks, it is the number of times
that  bond  interest  and  preferred  dividends  combined  have  been
covered.

The exact standards applied will vary with different authorities.
Since the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determine
precisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-
book, Security  Analysis, we  recommend  certain  “coverage”  stan-
dards, which appear in Table 11-1.*

Our basic test is applied only to the average results for a period
of years. Other authorities require also that a minimum coverage be
shown for every year considered. We approve a “poorest-year” test

* In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to assemble
his or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds invest in corporate
bonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified bundle of securities. Since it is
not  feasible  to  build  a  diversified  bond  portfolio  on  your  own  unless  you
have at least $100,000, the typical intelligent investor will be best off simply
buying  a  low-cost  bond  fund  and  leaving  the  painstaking  labor  of  credit
research to its managers. For more on bond funds, see the commentary on
Chapter 4.

The same minimum figures as above are required to be shown by the

that preferred dividends are not income-tax deductible, whereas
interest charges are so deductible.

as  an  alternative to  the  seven-year-average  test;  it  would  be  suffi-
cient if the bond or preferred stock met either of these criteria.

It may be objected that the large increase in bond interest rates
since 1961 would justify some offsetting reduction in the coverage
of  charges  required.  Obviously  it  would  be  much  harder  for  an
industrial  company  to  show  a  seven-times  coverage  of  interest
charges at 8% than at 41⁄2%. To meet this changed situation we now
suggest an alternative requirement related to the percent earned on

Security Analysis for the Lay Investor

285

the principal amount of the debt. These figures might be 33% before
taxes for an industrial company, 20% for a public utility, and 25%
for a railroad. It should be borne in mind here that the rate actually
paid  by  most  companies  on  their  total  debt  is  considerably  less
than  the  current  8%  figures,  since  they  have  the  benefit  of  older
issues  bearing  lower  coupons.  The  “poorest  year”  requirement
could be set at about two-thirds of the seven-year requirement.

In addition to the earnings-coverage test, a number of others are

generally applied. These include the following:

1. Size  of  Enterprise. There  is  a  minimum  standard  in  terms  of
volume of business for a corporation—varying as between indus-
trials, utilities, and railroads—and of population for a municipality.

2. Stock/Equity  Ratio. This  is  the  ratio  of  the  market  price  of  the
junior stock issues* to the total face amount of the debt, or the debt
plus preferred stock. It is a rough measure of the protection, or “cush-
ion,” afforded by the presence of a junior investment that must first
bear the brunt of unfavorable developments. This factor includes the
market’s appraisal of the future prospects of the enterprise.

3. Property Value. The asset values, as shown on the balance sheet
or  as  appraised,  were  formerly  considered  the  chief  security  and
protection  for  a  bond  issue.  Experience  has  shown  that  in  most
cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the
assets  lose  most  of  their  reputed  value.  Asset  values,  however,
retain  importance  as  a  separate  test  of  ample  security  for  bonds
and  preferred  stocks  in  three  enterprise  groups:  public  utilities
(because  rates  may  depend  largely  on  the  property  investment),
real-estate concerns, and investment companies.

At this point the alert investor should ask, “How dependable are
tests of safety that are measured by past and present performance,
in view of the fact that payment of interest and principal depends
upon what the future will bring forth?” The answer can be founded

* By  “junior  stock  issues”  Graham  means  shares  of  common  stock.  Pre-
ferred stock is considered “senior” to common stock because the company
must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any dividends on the
common.

286

The Intelligent Investor

only on experience. Investment history shows that bonds and pre-
ferred  stocks  that  have  met  stringent  tests  of  safety,  based  on  the
past, have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi-
tudes  of  the  future  successfully.  This  has  been  strikingly  demon-
strated in the major field of railroad bonds—a field that has been
marked  by  a  calamitous  frequency  of  bankruptcies  and  serious
losses. In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long
been  overbonded,  had  shown  an  inadequate  coverage  of  fixed
charges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been
ruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,
practically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial
embarrassment.  Our  premise  was  strikingly  vindicated  by  the
financial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s
and in 1950. All of these, with one exception, started their careers
with fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of
fixed-interest requirements was ample, or at least respectable. The
exception was the New Haven Railroad, which in its reorganization
year, 1947, earned its new charges only about 1.1 times. In conse-
quence, while all the other roads were able to come through rather
difficult times with solvency unimpaired, the New Haven relapsed
into trusteeship (for the third time) in 1961.

In Chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank-
ruptcy  of  the  Penn  Central  Railroad,  which  shook  the  financial
community  in  1970. An  elementary  fact  in  this  case  was  that  the
coverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as
early as 1965; hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided
or disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan-
cial collapse.

Our  observations  on  the  adequacy  of  the  past  record  to  judge
future  safety  apply,  and  to  an  even  greater  degree,  to  the  public
utilities,  which  constitute  a  major  area  for  bond  investment.
Receivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or
system is almost impossible. Since Securities and Exchange Com-
mission control was instituted,* along with the breakup of most of

* After  investors  lost  billions  of  dollars  on  the  shares  of  recklessly  assem-
bled utility companies in 1929–1932, Congress authorized the SEC to reg-
ulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.

the  holding-company  systems,  public-utility  financing  has  been
sound  and  bankruptcies  unknown.  The  financial  troubles  of  elec-
tric  and  gas  utilities  in  the  1930s  were  traceable  almost  100%  to
financial  excesses  and  mismanagement,  which  left  their  imprint
clearly  on  the  companies’  capitalization  structures.  Simple  but
stringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the investor
away from the issues that were later to default.

Among  industrial  bond  issues  the  long-term  record  has  been
different. Although  the  industrial  group  as  a  whole  has  shown  a
better growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util-
ities, it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ-
ual companies and lines of business. Thus in the past, at least, there
have been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus-
trial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of
major size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a
serious depression.

Few defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950, but
this fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression
during this long period. Since 1966 there have been adverse devel-
opments  in  the  financial  position  of  many  industrial  companies.
Considerable  difficulties  have  developed  as  the  result  of  unwise
expansion.  On  the  one  hand  this  has  involved  large  additions  to
both bank loans and long-term debt; on the other it has frequently
produced  operating  losses  instead  of  the  expected  profits. At  the
beginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the
interest  payments  of  all  nonfinancial  firms  had  grown  from  $9.8
billion in 1963 to $26.1 billion in 1970, and that interest payments
had taken 29% of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in
1971,  against  only  16%  in  1963.3 Obviously,  the  burden  on  many
individual firms had increased much more than this. Overbonded
companies  have  become  all  too  familiar.  There  is  every  reason  to
repeat the caution expressed in our 1965 edition:

We are not quite ready to suggest that the investor may count
on an indefinite continuance of this favorable situation, and hence
relax his standards of bond selection in the industrial or any other
group.

Common-Stock Analysis

The ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of
the  issue  which  can  be  compared  with  the  current  price  to  deter-
mine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase. This val-
uation,  in  turn,  would  ordinarily  be  found  by  estimating  the
average earnings over a period of years in the future and then mul-
tiplying that estimate by an appropriate “capitalization factor.”

The  now-standard  procedure  for  estimating  future  earning
power  starts  with  average  past data  for  physical  volume,  prices
received,  and  operating  margin.  Future  sales  in  dollars  are  then
projected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in
volume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in
turn,  are  grounded  first  on  general  economic  forecasts  of  gross
national product, and then on special calculations applicable to the
industry and company in question.

An  illustration  of  this  method  of  valuation  may  be  taken  from
our 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel. The
Value Line, a leading investment service, makes forecasts of future
earnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above, and then
derives a figure of “price potentiality” (or projected market value)
by applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer-
tain past relationships. In Table 11-2 we reproduce the projections
for 1967–1969 made in June 1964, and compare them with the earn-
ings,  and  average  market  price  actually  realized  in  1968  (which
approximates the 1967–1969 period).

The combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side,
but not seriously so. The corresponding predictions made six years
before  had  turned  out  to  be  overoptimistic  on  earnings  and  divi-
dends; but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier, with the
result  that  the  “price  potentiality”  figure  proved  to  be  about  the
same as the actual average price for 1963.

The reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore-
casts were wide of the mark. This is an instance in support of our
general view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a
good deal more dependable than those for individual companies.
Ideally, perhaps, the security analyst should pick out the three or
four companies whose future he thinks he knows the best, and con-
centrate his own and his clients’ interest on what he forecasts for

them. Unfortunately, it appears to be almost impossible to distin-
guish in advance between those individual forecasts which can be
relied upon and those which are subject to a large chance of error.
At bottom, this is the reason for the wide diversification practiced
by  the  investment  funds.  For  it  is  undoubtedly  better  to  concen-
trate on one stock that you know is going to prove highly profitable,
rather  than  dilute  your  results  to  a  mediocre  figure,  merely  for
diversification’s  sake.  But  this  is  not  done,  because  it  cannot  be
done dependably.4 The prevalence of wide diversification is in itself
a pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of “selectivity,” to which Wall
Street constantly pays lip service.*

Factors Affecting the Capitalization Rate

Though  average  future  earnings  are  supposed  to  be  the  chief
determinant  of  value,  the  security  analyst  takes  into  account  a
number of other factors of a more or less definite nature. Most of
these will enter into his capitalization rate, which can vary over a
wide range, depending upon the “quality” of the stock issue. Thus,
although  two  companies  may  have  the  same  figure  of  expected

* In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically mimicked
the  Standard  &  Poor’s  500-stock  index,  lest  any  different  holdings  cause
their returns to deviate from that of the index. In a countertrend, some fund
companies have launched what they call “focused” portfolios, which own 25
to 50 stocks that the managers declare to be their “best ideas.” That leaves
investors  wondering  whether  the  other  funds  run  by  the  same  managers
contain their worst ideas. Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do
not markedly outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder
whether  the  managers’  ideas  are  even  worth  having  in  the  first  place.  For
indisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification would
be foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a few great
ideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual investor, not diversifying
is foolish, since it is so difficult to select a limited number of stocks that will
include most winners and exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the
damage any single loser can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all
the big winners will rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock
market index fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.

earnings  per  share  in  1973–1975—say  $4—the  analyst  may  value
one as low as 40 and the other as high as 100. Let us deal briefly
with  some  of  the  considerations  that  enter  into  these  divergent
multipliers.

1. General  Long-Term  Prospects. No  one  really  knows  anything
about  what  will  happen  in  the  distant  future,  but  analysts  and
investors  have  strong  views  on  the  subject  just  the  same.  These
views  are  reflected  in  the  substantial  differentials  between  the
price/earnings  ratios  of  individual  companies  and  of  industry
groups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:

For example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the
DJIA were  selling  at  considerably  higher  multipliers  than  the  oil
companies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the
former than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are
often  soundly  based,  but  when  dictated  mainly  by  past  perfor-
mance they are as likely to be wrong as right.

We shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material
on the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their
earnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-
nies,  despite  their  high  multipliers,  made  practically  no  gain  in
earnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-
ter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in
their 1963 multipliers.5 Thus our chemical-stock example proved to
be  one  of  the  cases  in  which  the  market  multipliers  were  proven
wrong.*

* Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to
nearly  every  industry  in  nearly  every  time  period.  Wall  Street’s  consensus
view of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too
pessimistic.  Worse,  the  consensus  is  at  its  most  cheery  just  when  the
stocks  are  most  overpriced—and  gloomiest  just  when  they  are  cheapest.
The most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications
stocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999
and early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002. History proves
that  Wall  Street’s  “expert”  forecasters  are  equally  inept  at  predicting  the

2. Management. On Wall Street a great deal is constantly said on
this subject, but little that is really helpful. Until objective, quantita-
tive,  and  reasonably  reliable  tests  of  managerial  competence  are
devised  and  applied,  this  factor  will  continue  to  be  looked  at
through a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful
company has unusually good management. This will have shown
itself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-
mates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-
cussed factor of long-term prospects. The tendency to count it still
another time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to
expensive overvaluations. The management factor is most useful,
we think, in those cases in which a recent change has taken place
that has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual
figures.

Two  spectacular  occurrences  of  this  kind  were  associated  with
the Chrysler Motor Corporation. The first took place as far back as
1921,  when  Walter  Chrysler  took  command  of  the  almost  mori-
bund  Maxwell  Motors,  and  in  a  few  years  made  it  a  large  and
highly  profitable  enterprise,  while  numerous  other  automobile
companies  were  forced  out  of  business.  The  second  happened  as
recently  as  1962,  when  Chrysler  had  fallen  far  from  its  once  high
estate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.
Then new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over
the reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per
share to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low
of 381⁄2 in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6

3. Financial  Strength  and  Capital  Structure. Stock  of  a  company
with  a  lot  of  surplus  cash  and  nothing  ahead  of  the  common  is
clearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with
the same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi-
ties. Such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by
security  analysts.  A modest  amount  of  bonds  or  preferred  stock,

performance of 1) the market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) spe-
cific stocks. As Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do
any better are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions
that  are  not  dependent  on  the  accuracy  of  anybody’s  forecasts,  including
his or her own. (See Chapter 8.)

294

The Intelligent Investor

however, is not necessarily a disadvantage to the common, nor is
the moderate use of seasonal bank credit. (Incidentally, a top-heavy
structure—too  little  common  stock  in  relation  to  bonds  and  pre-
ferred—may under favorable conditions make for a huge specula-
tive profit in the common. This is the factor known as “leverage.”)

4. Dividend Record. One of the most persuasive tests of high qual-
ity  is  an  uninterrupted  record  of  dividend  payments  going  back
over  many  years.  We  think  that  a  record  of  continuous  dividend
payments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor
in  the  company’s  quality  rating.  Indeed  the  defensive  investor
might  be  justified  in  limiting  his  purchases  to  those  meeting  this
test.

5. Current  Dividend  Rate. This,  our  last  additional  factor,  is  the
most difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,
the majority of companies have come to follow what may be called
a  standard  dividend  policy.  This  has  meant  the  distribution  of
about two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent
period  of  high  profits  and  inflationary  demands  for  more  capital
the  figure  has  tended  to  be  lower.  (In  1969  it  was  59.5%  for  the
stocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-
rations.)*  Where  the  dividend  bears  a  normal  relationship  to  the
earnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-
stantially  affecting  the  result.  For  example,  a  typical  secondary
company  with  expected  average  earnings  of  $3  and  an  expected
dividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18
times its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.

However,  an  increasing  number  of  growth  companies  are
departing  from  the  once  standard  policy  of  paying  out  60%  or
more of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-

* This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has dropped consid-
erably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged investors from
seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of year-end 2002, the
payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S & P 500-stock index and, as recently
as  April  2000,  it  hit  an  all-time  low  of  just  25.3%.  (See  www.barra.com/
research/fundamentals.asp.) We discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in
the commentary on Chapter 19.

ers’ interests will be better served by retaining nearly all the profits
to  finance  expansion.  The  issue  presents  problems  and  requires
careful distinctions. We have decided to defer our discussion of the
vital question of proper dividend policy to a later section—Chapter
19—where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of
management-shareholder relations.

Capitalization Rates for Growth Stocks

Most  of  the  writing  of  security  analysts  on  formal  appraisals
relates to the valuation of growth stocks. Our study of the various
methods  has  led  us  to  suggest  a  foreshortened  and  quite  simple
formula  for  the  valuation  of  growth  stocks,  which  is  intended  to
produce  figures  fairly  close  to  those  resulting  from  the  more
refined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:

Value = Current (Normal) Earnings (cid:1) (8.5 plus twice 
the expected annual growth rate)

The growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to
ten years.7

In Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various
rates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-
tion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-
rent  market  price,  assuming  our  formula  is  valid.  In  our  last
edition we made that calculation for the DJIA and for six important
stock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-
mented at the time:

The  difference  between  the  implicit  32.4%  annual  growth  rate
for  Xerox  and  the  extremely  modest  2.8%  for  General  Motors  is
indeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market’s feel-
ing that General Motors’ 1963 earnings—the largest for any corpo-
ration in history—can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded
only  modestly  at  best.  The  price  earnings  ratio  of  Xerox,  on  the
other hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-
tened  upon  a  company  of  great  achievement  and  perhaps  still
greater promise.

The implicit or expected growth rate of 5.1% for the DJIA com-

pares  with  an  actual  annual  increase  of  3.4%  (compounded)
between 1951–1953 and 1961–1963.

We should have added a caution somewhat as follows: The val-
uations of expected high-growth stocks are necessarily on the low
side, if we were to assume these growth rates will actually be real-
ized.  In  fact,  according  to  the  arithmetic,  if  a  company  could  be
assumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitely in the future its
value would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for
the shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-
duce a margin of safety into his calculations—somewhat as an engi-
neer  does  in  his  specifications  for  a  structure.  On  this  basis  the
purchases  would  realize  his  assigned  objective  (in  1963,  a  future
overall return of 71⁄2% per annum) even if the growth rate actually
realized  proved  substantially  less  than  that  projected  in  the  for-
mula.  Of  course,  then,  if  that  rate  were  actually  realized  the
investor  would  be  sure  to  enjoy  a  handsome  additional  return.
There  is  really  no  way  of  valuing  a  high-growth  company  (with 
an  expected  rate  above,  say,  8%  annually),  in  which  the  analyst 
can  make  realistic  assumptions  of  both the  proper  multiplier  for 
the  current  earnings  and  the  expectable  multiplier  for  the  future
earnings.

As  it  happened  the  actual  growth  for  Xerox  and  IBM  proved
very  close  to  the  high  rates  implied  from  our  formula.  As  just
explained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance
in the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIA itself was also
about as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-
ate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox
and IBM. It turned out that the 23% price rise to the end of 1970,
plus  the  28%  in  aggregate  dividend  return  received,  gave  not  far
from  the  71⁄2%  annual  overall  gain  posited  in  our  formula.  In  the
case  of  the  other  four  companies  it  may  suffice  to  say  that  their
growth  did  not  equal  the  expectations  implied  in  the  1963  price
and that their quotations failed to rise as much as the DJIA. Warn-
ing: This  material  is  supplied  for  illustrative  purposes  only,  and
because of the inescapable necessity in security analysis to project
the future growth rate for most companies studied. Let the reader
not  be  misled  into  thinking  that  such  projections  have  any  high
degree  of  reliability  or,  conversely,  that  future  prices  can  be

298

The Intelligent Investor

counted  on  to  behave  accordingly  as  the  prophecies  are  realized,
surpassed, or disappointed.

We should point out that any “scientific,” or at least reasonably
dependable,  stock  evaluation  based  on  anticipated  future  results
must  take  future  interest  rates  into  account.  A given  schedule  of
expected  earnings,  or  dividends,  would  have  a  smaller  present
value  if  we  assume  a  higher  than  if  we  assume  a  lower  interest
structure.*  Such  assumptions  have  always  been  difficult  to  make
with  any  degree  of  confidence,  and  the  recent  violent  swings  in
long-term  interest  rates  render  forecasts  of  this  sort  almost  pre-
sumptuous. Hence we have retained our old formula above, sim-
ply because no new one would appear more plausible.

Industry Analysis

Because  the  general  prospects  of  the  enterprise  carry  major
weight  in  the  establishment  of  market  prices,  it  is  natural  for  the
security analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic
position  of  the  industry  and  of  the  individual  company  in  its
industry. Studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail. They are
sometimes  productive  of  valuable  insights  into  important  factors
that will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci-
ated by the current market. Where a conclusion of that kind can be
drawn with a fair degree of confidence, it affords a sound basis for
investment decisions.

Our  own  observation,  however,  leads  us  to  minimize  some-
what  the  practical  value  of  most  of  the  industry  studies  that  are
made available to investors. The material developed is ordinarily
of a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that
has  already  exerted  considerable  influence  on  market  quotations.

* Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount of money
doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in just over 10 years.
When interest rates are high, the amount of money you need to set aside 
today to reach a given value in the future is lower—since those high interest
rates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates
today  makes  a  future  stream  of  earnings  or  dividends  less  valuable—since 
the alternative of investing in bonds has become relatively more attractive.

Security Analysis for the Lay Investor

Rarely  does  one  find  a  brokerage-house  study  that  points  out, 
with a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-
ing  for  a  fall  or  that  an  unpopular  one  is  due  to  prosper.  Wall
Street’s  view  of  the  longer  future  is  notoriously  fallible,  and  this
necessarily  applies  to  that  important  part  of  its  investigations
which is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in
various industries.

We must  recognize,  however,  that  the  rapid  and  pervasive
growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on
the attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than in
the past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the
coming  decade  may  depend  on  its  relation  to  new  products  and
new processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study and
evaluate in  advance. Thus  there  is  doubtless  a  promising  area  for
effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with
research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his
own.  There  are  hazards  connected  with  investment  conclusions
derived  chiefly  from  such  glimpses  into  the  future,  and  not  sup-
ported  by  presently  demonstrable  value.  Yet  there  are  perhaps
equal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober
calculations  resting  on  actual  results.  The  investor  cannot  have  it
both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits that
are the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he
must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he
can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premium
for possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-
pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.

A Two-Part Appraisal Process

Let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal
of a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. A
great  deal  of  reflection  on  the  subject  has  led  us  to  conclude  that
this  better  be  done  quite  differently  than  is  now  the  established
practice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the
“past-performance  value,”  which  is  based  solely  on  the  past
record.  This  would  indicate  what  the  stock  would  be  worth—
absolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIA or of the S & P compos-
ite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue

300

The Intelligent Investor

unchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-
ative growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-
tinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be
carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-
ual  weights  to  past  figures  for  profitability,  stability,  and  growth,
and  also  for  current  financial  condition.  The  second  part  of  the
analysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on
past  performance  should  be  modified  because  of  new  conditions
expected in the future.

Such  a  procedure  would  divide  the  work  between  senior  and
junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the
formula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-
performance  value.  (2)  The  junior  analysts  would  work  up  such
factors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanical
fashion.  (3)  The  senior  analyst  would  then  determine  to  what
extent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely to
differ  from  its  past  record,  and  what  change  should  be  made  in 
the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the
senior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and the
modified one, with his reasons for the change.

Is a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-
tive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.
We doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently
dependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or
small.  We  shall  illustrate  the  difficulties  of  this  job  in  our  discus-
sion  of  Aluminum  Company  of  America  (ALCOA)  in  the  next
chapter.  Nonetheless  it  should  be  done  for  such  common  stocks.
Why? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or
projected  valuations,  as  part  of  their  daily  work.  The  method  we
propose  should  be  an  improvement  on  those  generally  followed
today.  Secondly,  because  it  should  give  useful  experience  and
insight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because
work  of  this  kind  could  produce  an  invaluable  body  of  recorded
experience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may lead
to better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-
sibilities  and  limitations.  The  public-utility  stocks  might  well
prove  an  important  area  in  which  this  approach  will  show  real
pragmatic  value.  Eventually  the  intelligent  analyst  will  confine
himself  to  those  groups  in  which  the  future  appears  reasonably

predictable,*  or  where  the  margin  of  safety  of  past-performance
value over current price is so large that he can take his chances on
future variations—as he does in selecting well-secured senior secu-
rities.

In  subsequent  chapters  we  shall  supply  concrete  examples  of
the application of analytical techniques. But they will only be illus-
trations. If the reader finds the subject interesting he should pursue
it systematically and thoroughly before he considers himself quali-
fied to pass a final buy-or-sell judgment of his own on a security
issue.

* These  industry  groups,  ideally,  would  not  be  overly  dependent  on  such
unforeseeable factors as fluctuating interest rates or the future direction of
prices  for  raw  materials  like  oil  or  metals.  Possibilities  might  be  industries
like gaming, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, nursing homes, or waste man-
agement.

Putting a Price on the Future

Which factors determine how much you should be willing to pay for a
stock?  What  makes  one  company  worth  10  times  earnings  and
another worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are
not  overpaying  for  an  apparently  rosy  future  that  turns  out  to  be  a
murky nightmare?

Graham feels that five elements are decisive.1 He summarizes them as:

•
•
•
•
•

the company’s “general long-term prospects”
the quality of its management
its financial strength and capital structure
its dividend record
and its current dividend rate.

Let’s look at these factors in the light of today’s market.
The  long-term  prospects. Nowadays,  the  intelligent  investor
should  begin  by  downloading  at  least  five  years’  worth  of  annual
reports (Form 10-K) from the company’s website or from the EDGAR

1 Because so few of today’s individual investors buy—or should buy—individ-
ual bonds, we will limit this discussion to stock analysis. For more on bond
funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.

database  at  www.sec.gov.2 Then  comb  through  the  financial  state-
ments,  gathering  evidence  to  help  you  answer  two  overriding  ques-
tions. What makes this company grow? Where do (and where will) its
profits come from? Among the problems to watch for:

•

•

The company is a “serial acquirer.” An average of more than two
or three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all,
if  the  company  itself  would  rather  buy  the  stock  of  other  busi-
nesses than invest in its own, shouldn’t you take the hint and look
elsewhere  too?  And  check  the  company’s  track  record  as  an
acquirer. Watch out for corporate bulimics—firms that wolf down
big acquisitions, only to end up vomiting them back out. Lucent,
Mattel, Quaker Oats, and Tyco International are among the com-
panies that have had to disgorge acquisitions at sickening losses.
Other firms take chronic write-offs, or accounting charges proving
that they overpaid for their past acquisitions. That’s a bad omen
for future deal making.3
The company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or selling stock
to raise boatloads of Other People’s Money. These fat infusions of
OPM are labeled “cash from financing activities” on the statement
of cash flows in the annual report. They can make a sick company
appear  to  be  growing  even  if  its  underlying  businesses  are  not
generating  enough  cash—as  Global  Crossing  and  WorldCom
showed not long ago.4

2 You should also get at least one year’s worth of quarterly reports (on Form
10-Q). By definition, we are assuming that you are an “enterprising” investor
willing  to  devote  a  considerable  amount  of  effort  to  your  portfolio.  If  the
steps in this chapter sound like too much work to you, then you are not tem-
peramentally  well  suited  to  picking  your  own  stocks.  You  cannot  reliably
obtain  the  results  you  imagine  unless  you  put  in  the  kind  of  effort  we
describe.
3 You can usually find details on acquisitions in the “Management’s Discus-
sion  and  Analysis”  section  of  Form  10-K;  cross-check  it  against  the  foot-
notes  to  the  financial  statements.  For  more  on  “serial  acquirers,”  see  the
commentary on Chapter 12.
4 To determine whether a company is an OPM addict, read the “Statement
of  Cash  Flows”  in  the  financial  statements.  This  page  breaks  down  the

Commentary on Chapter 11

The company is a Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer (or
a handful) for most of its revenues. In October 1999, fiber-optics
maker  Sycamore  Networks,  Inc.  sold  stock  to  the  public  for  the
first  time.  The  prospectus  revealed  that  one  customer,  Williams
Communications, accounted for 100% of Sycamore’s $11 million
in  total  revenues.  Traders  blithely  valued  Sycamore’s  shares  at
$15  billion.  Unfortunately,  Williams  went  bankrupt  just  over  two
years  later.  Although  Sycamore  picked  up  other  customers,  its
stock lost 97% between 2000 and 2002.

As you study the sources of growth and profit, stay on the lookout

for positives as well as negatives. Among the good signs:

•

The company has a wide “moat,” or competitive advantage. Like
castles,  some  companies  can  easily  be  stormed  by  marauding
competitors, while others are almost impregnable. Several forces
can  widen  a  company’s  moat:  a  strong  brand  identity (think  of
Harley  Davidson,  whose  buyers  tattoo  the  company’s  logo  onto
their  bodies);  a  monopoly or  near-monopoly  on  the  market;
economies of scale, or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods
or  services  cheaply  (consider  Gillette,  which  churns  out  razor
blades  by  the  billion);  a  unique  intangible  asset (think  of  Coca-
Cola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical
value but maintains a priceless hold on consumers); a resistance
to substitution (most businesses have no alternative to electricity,
so utility companies are unlikely to be supplanted any time soon).5

company’s  cash  inflows  and  outflows  into  “operating  activities,”  “invest-
ing  activities,”  and  “financing  activities.”  If  cash  from  operating  activities  is
consistently  negative,  while  cash  from  financing  activities  is  consistently
positive,  the  company  has  a  habit  of  craving  more  cash  than  its  own 
businesses  can  produce—and  you  should  not  join  the  “enablers”  of  that
habitual  abuse.  For  more  on  Global  Crossing,  see  the  commentary  on
Chapter 12. For more on WorldCom, see the sidebar in the commentary on
Chapter 6.
5 For more insight into “moats,” see the classic book Competitive Strategy
by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter (Free Press, New
York, 1998).

Commentary on Chapter 11

305

The company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. By looking back at
the  income  statements,  you  can  see  whether  revenues  and  net
earnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10
years. A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal confirmed
what  other  studies  (and  the  sad  experience  of  many  investors)
have shown: that the fastest-growing companies tend to overheat
and flame out.6 If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10%
pretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the
15%  growth  hurdle  that  many  companies  set  for  themselves  is
delusional. And an even higher rate—or a sudden burst of growth
in one or two years—is all but certain to fade, just like an inexperi-
enced marathoner who tries to run the whole race as if it were a
100-meter dash.
The company sows and reaps. No matter how good its products
or how powerful its brands, a company must spend some money
to  develop  new  business.  While  research  and  development
spending is not a source of growth today, it may well be tomor-
row—particularly  if  a  firm  has  a  proven  record  of  rejuvenating  its
businesses with new ideas and equipment. The average budget
for research and development varies across industries and com-

sales  on  R  &  D,  while  3M  spent  6.5%  and  Johnson  &  Johnson
10.9%. In the long run, a company that spends nothing on R & D
is at least as vulnerable as one that spends too much.

The  quality  and  conduct  of  management. A  company’s  execu-
tives should say what they will do, then do what they said. Read the
past  annual  reports  to  see  what  forecasts  the  managers  made  and 
if  they  fulfilled  them  or  fell  short.  Managers  should  forthrightly  admit
their  failures  and  take  responsibility  for  them,  rather  than  blaming 
all-purpose  scapegoats  like  “the  economy,”  “uncertainty,”  or  “weak
demand.”  Check  whether  the  tone  and  substance  of  the  chairman’s
letter  stay  constant,  or  fluctuate  with  the  latest  fads  on  Wall  Street.

the leading edge of the transformative software revolution”?)

These questions can also help you determine whether the people
who run the company will act in the interests of the people who own
the company:

Are they looking out for No. 1?

A firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a
very good reason. (Perhaps he discovered—and patented—the Foun-
tain of Youth? Or found El Dorado and bought it for $1 an acre? Or
contacted life on another planet and negotiated a contract obligat-
ing  the  aliens  to  buy  all  their  supplies  from  only  one  company  on
Earth?) Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests
that the firm is run by the managers, for the managers.

If a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock
options for insiders, stay away. In this switcheroo, a company can-
cels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employees
and  executives,  then  replaces  them  with  new  ones  at  advanta-
geous prices. If their value is never allowed to go to zero, while
their potential profit is always infinite, how can options encourage
good stewardship of corporate assets? Any established company
that reprices options—as dozens of high-tech firms have—is a dis-
grace. And any investor who buys stock in such a company is a
sheep begging to be sheared.

By  looking  in  the  annual  report  for  the  mandatory  footnote
about stock options, you can see how large the “option overhang”
is.  AOL  Time  Warner,  for  example,  reported  in  the  front  of  its
annual report that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock out-
standing as of December 31, 2002—but a footnote in the bowels
of the report reveals that the company had issued options on 657
million  more  shares.  So  AOL’s  future  earnings  will  have  to  be
divided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the poten-
tial flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimate
a company’s future value.7

gov, shows whether a firm’s senior executives and directors have
been buying or selling shares. There can be legitimate reasons for
an insider to sell—diversification, a bigger house, a divorce settle-
ment—but  repeated  big  sales  are  a  bright  red  flag.  A  manager
can’t legitimately be your partner if he keeps selling while you’re
buying.
Are they managers or promoters?

Executives  should  spend  most  of  their  time  managing  their
company in private, not promoting it to the investing public. All too
often,  CEOs  complain  that  their  stock  is  undervalued  no  matter
how  high  it  goes—forgetting  Graham’s  insistence  that  managers
should try to keep the stock price from going either too low or too
high.8 Meanwhile, all too many chief financial officers give “earn-
ings guidance,” or guesstimates of the company’s quarterly prof-
its.  And  some  firms  are  hype-o-chondriacs,  constantly  spewing
forth press releases boasting of temporary, trivial, or hypothetical
“opportunities.”

A  handful  of  companies—including  Coca-Cola,  Gillette,  and
USA  Interactive—have  begun  to  “just  say  no”  to  Wall  Street’s
short-term  thinking.  These  few  brave  outfits  are  providing  more
detail  about  their  current  budgets  and  long-term  plans,  while
refusing  to  speculate  about  what  the  next  90  days  might  hold.
(For a model of how a company can communicate candidly and
fairly  with  its  shareholders,  go  to  the  EDGAR  database  at
www.sec.gov  and  view  the  8-K  filings  made  by  Expeditors  In-
ternational  of  Washington,  which  periodically  posts  its  superb
question-and-answer dialogues with shareholders there.)

Finally,  ask  whether  the  company’s  accounting  practices  are
designed  to  make  its  financial  results  transparent—or  opaque.  If
“nonrecurring” charges keep recurring, “extraordinary” items crop
up so often that they seem ordinary, acronyms like EBITDA take
priority over net income, or “pro forma” earnings are used to cloak
actual losses, you may be looking at a firm that has not yet learned
how to put its shareholders’ long-term interests first.9

Commentary on Chapter 11

Financial strength and capital structure. The most basic possible
definition  of  a  good  business  is  this:  It  generates  more  cash  than  it
consumes. Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to
productive use. In the long run, companies that meet this definition are
virtually  certain  to  grow  in  value,  no  matter  what  the  stock  market
does.

Start  by  reading  the  statement  of  cash  flows  in  the  company’s
annual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily
throughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further. Warren Buffett
has  popularized  the  concept  of  owner  earnings, or  net  income  plus
amortization and depreciation, minus normal capital expenditures. As
portfolio manager Christopher Davis of Davis Selected Advisors puts
it, “If you owned 100% of this business, how much cash would you
have  in  your  pocket  at  the  end  of  the  year?”  Because  it  adjusts  for
accounting  entries  like  amortization  and  depreciation  that  do  not
affect the company’s cash balances, owner earnings can be a better
measure than reported net income. To fine-tune the definition of owner
earnings, you should also subtract from reported net income:

•

•
•

any  costs  of  granting  stock  options,  which  divert  earnings  away
from existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners
any “unusual,” “nonrecurring,” or “extraordinary” charges
any “income” from the company’s pension fund.

If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at
least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable gen-
erator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.

Next, look at the company’s capital structure. Turn to the balance
sheet to see how much debt (including preferred stock) the company
has; in general, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital.
In  the  footnotes  to  the  financial  statements,  determine  whether  the
long-term debt is fixed-rate (with constant interest payments) or vari-
able (with payments that fluctuate, which could become costly if inter-
est rates rise).

Look in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the
“ratio  of  earnings  to  fixed  charges.”  That  exhibit  to  Amazon.com’s
2002  annual  report  shows  that  Amazon’s  earnings  fell  $145  million
short  of  covering  its  interest  costs.  In  the  future,  Amazon  will  either
have to earn much more from its operations or find a way to borrow
money  at  lower  rates.  Otherwise,  the  company  could  end  up  being

Commentary on Chapter 11

309

owned  not  by  its  shareholders  but  by  its  bondholders,  who  can  lay
claim  to  Amazon’s  assets  if  they  have  no  other  way  of  securing  the
interest payments they are owed. (To be fair, Amazon’s ratio of earn-
ings to fixed charges was far healthier in 2002 than two years earlier,
when earnings fell $1.1 billion short of covering debt payments.)

A few words on dividends and stock policy (for more, please see

Chapter 19):

The burden of proof is on the company to show that you are better
off if it does not pay a dividend. If the firm has consistently outper-
formed the competition in good markets and bad, the managers are
clearly putting the cash to optimal use. If, however, business is fal-
tering or the stock is underperforming its rivals, then the managers
and directors are misusing the cash by refusing to pay a dividend.
Companies  that  repeatedly  split  their  shares—and  hype  those
splits in breathless press releases—treat their investors like dolts.
Like Yogi Berra, who wanted his pizza cut into four slices because
“I  don’t  think  I  can  eat  eight,”  the  shareholders  who  love  stock
splits miss the point. Two shares of a stock at $50 are not worth
more  than  one  share  at  $100.  Managers  who  use  splits  to  pro-
mote their stock are aiding and abetting the worst instincts of the
investing public, and the intelligent investor will think twice before
turning any money over to such condescending manipulators.10
Companies should buy back their shares when they are cheap—
not  when  they  are  at  or  near  record  highs.  Unfortunately,  it
recently  has  become  all  too  common  for  companies  to  repur-
chase their stock when it is overpriced. There is no more cynical
waste of a company’s cash—since the real purpose of that maneu-
ver is to enable top executives to reap multimillion-dollar paydays
by  selling  their  own  stock  options  in  the  name  of  “enhancing
shareholder value.”

A substantial amount of anecdotal evidence, in fact, suggests that
managers who talk about “enhancing shareholder value” seldom do.
In investing, as with life in general, ultimate victory usually goes to the
doers, not to the talkers.

CHAPTER 12

Things to Consider About 

Per-Share Earnings

This chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor
that  cannot  avoid  being  contradictory  in  their  implications.  The
first is: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. The second is:
If you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby
traps  in  the  per-share  figures.  If  our  first  warning  were  followed
strictly  the  second  would  be  unnecessary.  But  it  is  too  much  to
expect  that  most  shareholders  can  relate  all  their  common-stock
decisions to the long-term record and the long-term prospects. The
quarterly figures, and especially the annual figures, receive major
attention  in  financial  circles,  and  this  emphasis  can  hardly  fail  to
have its impact on the investor’s thinking. He may well need some
education in this area, for it abounds in misleading possibilities.

As  this  chapter  is  being  written  the  earnings  report  of  Alu-
minum  Company  of  America  (ALCOA)  for  1970  appears  in  the
Wall Street Journal. The first figures shown are

Share earnings a

1970
$5.20

1969
$5.58

The little a at the outset is explained in a footnote to refer to “pri-
mary earnings,” before special charges. There is much more foot-
note  material;  in  fact  it  occupies  twice  as  much  space  as  do  the
basic figures themselves.

For  the  December  quarter  alone,  the  “earnings  per  share”  are

given as $1.58 in 1970 against $1.56 in 1969.

The investor or speculator interested in ALCOA shares, reading

310

Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

311

those figures, might say to himself: “Not so bad. I knew that 1970
was a recession year in aluminum. But the fourth quarter shows a
gain over 1969, with earnings at the rate of $6.32 per year. Let me
see. The stock is selling at 62. Why, that’s less than ten times earn-
ings. That makes it look pretty cheap, compared with 16 times for
International Nickel, etc., etc.”

But if our investor-speculator friend had bothered to read all the
material in the footnote, he would have found that instead of one
figure  of  earnings  per  share  for  the  year  1970  there  were  actually
four, viz.:

Primary earnings
Net income (after special charges)
Fully diluted, before special charges
Fully diluted, after special charges

1970

$5.20
4.32
5.01
4.19

1969

$5.58
5.58
5.35
5.35

For the fourth quarter alone only two figures are given:

Primary earnings
Net income (after special charges)

$1.58
.70

$1.56
1.56

What do all these additional earnings mean? Which earnings are
true earnings for the year and the December quarter? If the latter
should be taken at 70 cents—the net income after special charges—
the  annual  rate  would  be  $2.80  instead  of  $6.32,  and  the  price  62
would  be  “22  times  earnings,”  instead  of  the  10  times  we  started
with.

Part of the question as to the “true earnings” of ALCOA can be
answered quite easily. The reduction from $5.20 to $5.01, to allow
for the effects of “dilution,” is clearly called for. ALCOA has a large
bond issue convertible into common stock; to calculate the “earn-
ing  power”  of  the  common,  based  on  the  1970  results,  it  must  be
assumed that the conversion privilege will be exercised if it should
prove profitable to the bondholders to do so. The amount involved
in  the  ALCOA picture  is  relatively  small,  and  hardly  deserves
detailed  comment.  But  in  other  cases,  making  allowance  for  con-
version rights—and the existence of stock-purchase warrants—can

312

The Intelligent Investor

reduce  the  apparent  earnings  by  half,  or  more.  We  shall  present
examples  of  a  really  significant  dilution  factor  below  (page  411).
(The financial services are not always consistent in their allowance
for the dilution factor in their reporting and analyses.)*

Let us turn now to the matter of “special charges.” This figure of
$18,800,000, or 88 cents per share, deducted in the fourth quarter, is
not unimportant. Is it to be ignored entirely, or fully recognized as
an  earnings  reduction,  or  partly  recognized  and  partly  ignored?
The alert investor might ask himself also how does it happen that
there was a virtual epidemic of such special charge-offs appearing
after the close of 1970, but not in previous years? Could there pos-
sibly have been some fine Italian hands† at work with the account-
ing—but  always,  of  course,  within  the  limits  of  the  permissible?
When  we  look  closely  we  may  find  that  such  losses,  charged  off
before they actually occur, can be charmed away, as it were, with
no unhappy effect on either past or future “primary earnings.” In
some extreme cases they might be availed of to make subsequent
earnings  appear  nearly  twice  as  large  as  in  reality—by  a  more  or
less prestidigitous treatment of the tax credit involved.

* “Dilution”  is  one  of  many  words  that  describe  stocks  in  the  language  of
fluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to be “liquid.” When
a company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its shares. And, in earlier days, a
company that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-
ible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have “watered”
its stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market
manipulator Daniel Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He
would  drive  his  cattle  south  toward  Manhattan,  force-feeding  them  salt
along the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge
volumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,
where  the  water  they  had  just  drunk  would  increase  their  weight.  That
enabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by
the pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning.
† Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant Italian
stone  carvers  who  ornamented  the  otherwise  plain  facades  of  buildings
throughout New York in the early 1900s. Accountants, likewise, can trans-
form simple financial facts into intricate and even incomprehensible patterns.

Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

313

In  dealing  with  ALCOA’s  special  charges,  the  first  thing  to
establish is how they arose. The footnotes are specific enough. The
deductions came from four sources, viz.:

1. Management’s  estimate  of  the  anticipated  costs  of  closing

down the manufactured products division.

2. Ditto for closing down ALCOA Castings Co.’s plants.
3. Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOA Credit Co.
4. Also,  estimated  costs  of  $5.3  million  associated  with  comple-

tion of the contract for a “curtain wall.”

All of these items are related to future costs and losses. It is easy
to  say  that  they  are  not  part  of  the  “regular  operating  results”  of
1970—but if so, where do they belong? Are they so “extraordinary
and nonrecurring” as to belong nowhere? A widespread enterprise
such as ALCOA, doing a $1.5 billion business annually, must have
a lot of divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not
be  normal  rather  than  extraordinary  for  one  or  more  to  prove
unprofitable,  and  to  require  closing  down?  Similarly  for  such
things as a contract to build a wall. Suppose that any time a com-
pany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of
charging it off as a “special item,” and thus reporting its “primary
earnings”  per  share  so  as  to  include  only  its  profitable  contracts
and operations? Like King Edward VII’s sundial, that marked only
the “sunny hours.”*

* The  king  probably  took  his  inspiration  from  a  once-famous  essay  by  the
English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near Venice that
bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or “I count only the hours
that  are  serene.”  Companies  that  chronically  exclude  bad  news  from  their
financial  results  on  the  pretext  that  negative  events  are  “extraordinary”  or
“nonrecurring”  are  taking  a  page  from  Hazlitt,  who  urged  his  readers  “to
take no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and ne-
glect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments,
turning away to the sunny side of things, and letting the rest slip from our
imaginations, unheeded or forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.
1827.) Unfortunately, investors must always count the sunny and dark hours
alike.

314

The Intelligent Investor

The  reader  should  note  two  ingenious  aspects  of  the  ALCOA
procedure we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating
future  losses the  company  escapes  the  necessity  of  allocating  the
losses  themselves  to  an  identifiable  year.  They  don’t  belong  in
1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they
won’t be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because
they have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not
be just a little misleading?

The ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving
from these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-
cally  that  only  the  “after-tax  effect”  has  been  charged  off.)  If  the
ALCOA figure represents future losses before the related tax credit,
then not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these
charges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by
a  tax  credit  of  some  50%  thereof.  It  is  difficult  to  believe  that  the
accounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-
panies  which  have  had  large  losses  in  the  past  have  been  able  to
report  future  earnings  without  charging  the  normal  taxes  against
them, in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed—
based  paradoxically  enough  on  their  past  disgraces.  (Tax  credits
resulting from past years’ losses are now being shown separately as
“special items,” but they will enter into future statistics as part of
the  final  “net-income”  figure.  However,  a  reserve  now  set  up  for
future losses, if net of expected tax credit, should not create an addi-
tion of this sort to the net income of later years.)

The  other  ingenious  feature  is  the  use  by  ALCOA and  many
other  companies  of  the  1970  year-end  for  making  these  special
charge-offs.  The  stock  market  took  what  appeared  to  be  a  blood
bath  in  the  first  half  of  1970.  Everyone  expected  relatively  poor
results for the year for most companies. Wall Street was now antic-
ipating better results in 1971, 1972, etc. What a nice arrangement,
then,  to  charge  as  much  as  possible  to  the  bad  year,  which  had
already  been  written  off  mentally  and  had  virtually  receded  into
the  past,  leaving  the  way  clear  for  nicely  fattened  figures  in  the
next few years! Perhaps this is good accounting, good business pol-
icy,  and  good  for  management-shareholder  relationships.  But  we
have lingering doubts.

The combination of widely (or should it be wildly?) diversified
operations with the impulse to clean house at the end of 1970 has

Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

315

produced  some  strange-looking  footnotes  to  the  annual  reports.
The reader may be amused by the following explanation given by 
a  New  York  Stock  Exchange  company  (which  shall  remain
unnamed) of its “special items” aggregating $2,357,000, or about a
third  of  the  income  before  charge-offs:  “Consists  of  provision  for
closing Spalding United Kingdom operations; provision for reorga-
nizational  expenses  of  a  division;  costs  of  selling  a  small  baby-
pants  and  bib  manufacturing  company,  disposing  of  part  interest
in a Spanish car-leasing facility, and liquidation of a ski-boot opera-
tion.” *

Years  ago  the  strong  companies  used  to  set  up  “contingency
reserves” out of the profits of good years to absorb some of the bad
effects  of  depression  years  to  come.  The  underlying  idea  was  to
equalize  the  reported  earnings,  more  or  less,  and  to  improve  the
stability factor in the company’s record. A worthy motive, it would
seem; but the accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as
misstating the true earnings. They insisted that each year’s results
be presented as they were, good or bad, and the shareholders and
analysts  be  allowed  to  do  the  averaging  or  equalizing  for  them-
selves. We seem now to be witnessing the opposite phenomenon,
with everyone charging off as much as possible against forgotten
1970,  so  as  to  start  1971  with  a  slate  not  only  clean  but  specially
prepared to show pleasing per-share figures in the coming years.

It is time to return to our first question. What then were the true
earnings  of ALCOA in  1970?  The  accurate  answer  would  be:  The
$5.01  per  share,  after  “dilution,”  less that  part  of  the  82  cents  of
“special charges” that may properly be attributed to occurrences in
1970. But we do not know what that portion is, and hence we cannot
properly state the true earnings for the year. The management and the
auditors  should  have  given  us  their  best  judgment  on  this  point,
but they did not do so. And furthermore, the management and the
auditors  should  have  provided  for  deduction  of  the  balance  of
these  charges  from  the  ordinary  earnings of  a  suitable  number  of

* The  company  to  which  Graham  refers  so  coyly  appears  to  be  American
Machine & Foundry (or AMF Corp.), one of the most jumbled conglomerates
of the late 1960s. It was a predecessor of today’s AMF Bowling Worldwide,
which operates bowling alleys and manufactures bowling equipment.

future years—say, not more than five. This evidently they will not
do  either,  since  they  have  already  conveniently  disposed  of  the
entire sum as a 1970 special charge.

The more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures
as published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard
against accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair
the  true  comparability  of  the  numbers.  We  have  mentioned  three
sorts of these factors: the use of special charges, which may never be
reflected  in  the  per-share  earnings,  the  reduction  in  the  normal
income-tax deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution fac-
tor  implicit  in  the  existence  of  substantial  amounts  of  convertible
securities  or  warrants.1 A fourth  item  that  has  had  a  significant
effect  on  reported  earnings  in  the  past  is  the  method  of  treating
depreciation—chiefly  as  between  the  “straight-line”  and  the
“accelerated”  schedules.  We  refrain  from  details  here.  But  as  an
example  current  as  we  write,  let  us  mention  the  1970  report  of
Trane Co. This firm showed an increase of nearly 20% in per-share
earnings over 1969—$3.29 versus $2.76—but half of this came from
returning to the older straight-line depreciation rates, less burden-
some  on  earnings  than  the  accelerated  method  used  the  year
before. (The company will continue to use the accelerated rate on
its income-tax return, thus deferring income-tax payments on the
difference.)  Still  another  factor,  important  at  times,  is  the  choice
between  charging  off  research  and  development  costs  in  the  year
they  are  incurred  or  amortizing  them  over  a  period  of  years.
Finally,  let  us  mention  the  choice  between  the  FIFO  (first-in-first-
out) and LIFO (last-in-first-out) methods of valuing inventories.*

* Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting fac-
tors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as if” finan-
cial  statements,  which  report  a  company’s  earnings  as  if  Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another is the dilu-
tive effect of issuing millions of stock options for executive compensation,
then buying back millions of shares to keep those options from reducing the
value of the common stock. A third is unrealistic assumptions of return on
the company’s pension funds, which can artificially inflate earnings in good
years  and  depress  them  in  bad.  Another  is  “Special  Purpose  Entities,”  or
affiliated firms or partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the com-

Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

An obvious remark here would be that investors should not pay
any attention to these accounting variables if the amounts involved
are relatively small. But Wall Street being as it is, even items quite
minor  in  themselves  can  be  taken  seriously.  Two  days  before  the
ALCOA report  appeared  in  the  Wall  Street  Journal, the  paper  had
quite a discussion of the corresponding statement of Dow Chemi-
cal. It closed with the observation that “many analysts” had been
troubled by the fact that Dow had included a 21-cent item in regu-
lar profits for 1969, instead of treating it as an item of “extraordi-
nary  income.”  Why  the  fuss?  Because,  evidently,  evaluations  of
Dow Chemical involving many millions of dollars in the aggregate
seemed  to  depend  on  exactly  what  was  the  percentage  gain  for
1969  over  1968—in  this  case  either  9%  or  41⁄2%.  This  strikes  us 
as rather absurd; it is very unlikely that small differences involved
in  one  year’s  results  could  have  any  bearing  on  future  average
profits or growth, and on a conservative, realistic valuation of the
enterprise.

By contrast, consider another statement also appearing in Janu-
ary  1971.  This  concerned  Northwest  Industries  Inc.’s  report  for
1970.* The company was planning to write off, as a special charge,
not less than $264 million in one fell swoop. Of this, $200 million
represents the loss to be taken on the proposed sale of the railroad
subsidiary  to  its  employees  and  the  balance  a  write-down  of  a
recent  stock  purchase.  These  sums  would  work  out  to  a  loss  of
about $35 per share of common before dilution offsets, or twice its
then current market price. Here we have something really signifi-

pany  and  thus  “remove”  those  financial  risks  from  the  company’s  balance
sheet. Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other
“soft”  costs  as  assets  of  the  company,  rather  than  as  normal  expenses  of
doing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary
that accompanies this chapter.
* Northwest  Industries  was  the  holding  company  for,  among  other  busi-
nesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear
(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over in
1985  by  overindebted  financier  William  Farley,  who  ran  the  company  into
the  ground.  Fruit  of  the  Loom  was  bought  in  a  bankruptcy  proceeding  by
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.

cant.  If  the  transaction  goes  through,  and  if  the  tax  laws  are  not
changed,  this  loss  provided  for  in  1970  will  permit  Northwest
Industries  to  realize  about  $400  million  of  future  profits  (within
five  years)  from  its  other  diversified  interests  without  paying
income  tax  thereon.*  What  will  then  be  the  real  earnings  of  that
enterprise; should they be calculated with or without provision for
the nearly 50% in income taxes which it will not actually have to
pay? In our opinion, the proper mode of calculation would be first
to consider the indicated earning power on the basis of full income-
tax  liability,  and  to  derive  some  broad  idea  of  the  stock’s  value
based on that estimate. To this should be added some bonus figure,
representing  the  value  per  share  of  the  important  but  temporary
tax exemption the company will enjoy. (Allowance must be made,
also,  for  a  possible  large-scale  dilution  in  this  case.  Actually,  the
convertible preferred issues and warrants would more than double
the outstanding common shares if the privileges are exercised.)

All this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers, but it
belongs in our story. Corporate accounting is often tricky; security
analysis  can  be  complicated;  stock  valuations  are  really  depend-
able  only  in  exceptional  cases.†  For  most  investors  it  would  be
probably best to assure themselves that they are getting good value
for the prices they pay, and let it go at that.

* Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that allows corpora-
tions  to  “carry  forward”  their  net  operating  losses.  As  the  tax  code  now
stands, these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing the
company’s  tax  liability  for  the  entire  period  (and  thus  raising  its  earnings
after  tax).  Therefore,  investors  should  consider  whether  recent  severe
losses could actually improve the company’s net earnings in the future.
† Investors  should  keep  these  words  at  hand  and  remind  themselves  of
them frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional
cases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the
time, the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden-
tical. The market’s judgment on price is often unreliable. Unfortunately, the
margin of the market’s pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the
expense of trading on them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate
the costs of trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any
price  discrepancy—and  should  never  count  on  being  able  to  sell  for  the
exact price currently quoted in the market.

Use of Average Earnings

In former times analysts and investors paid considerable atten-
tion to the average earnings over a fairly long period in the past—
usually from seven to ten years. This “mean figure”* was useful for
ironing out the frequent ups and downs of the business cycle, and
it  was  thought  to  give  a  better  idea  of  the  company’s  earning
power  than  the  results  of  the  latest  year  alone.  One  important
advantage  of  such  an  averaging  process  is  that  it  will  solve  the
problem  of  what  to  do  about  nearly  all  the  special  charges  and
credits.  They  should  be  included in  the  average  earnings.  For  cer-
tainly  most  of  these  losses  and  gains  represent  a  part  of  the
company’s operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average
earnings for 1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as $3.62 and for
the  seven  years  1964–1970  as  $4.62  per  share.  If  such  figures  are
used in conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earn-
ings  during  the  same  period,  they  could  give  a  really  informing
picture of the company’s past performance.

Calculation of the Past Growth Rate

It is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company’s
record  be  taken  adequately  into  account.  Where  the  growth  has
been large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-
year average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel-
evant.  This  need  not  be  the  case.  The  earnings  can  be  given  in
terms both of the average and the latest figure. We suggest that the
growth rate itself be calculated by comparing the average of the last
three  years  with  corresponding  figures  ten  years  earlier.  (Where
there  is  a  problem  of  “special  charges  or  credits”  it  may  be  dealt
with  on  some  compromise  basis.)  Note  the  following  calculation
for the growth of ALCOA as against that of Sears Roebuck and the
DJIA group as a whole.

Comment: These few figures could be made the subject of a long
discussion. They probably show as well as any others, derived by
elaborate  mathematical  treatment,  the  actual  growth  of  earnings

* “Mean  figure”  refers  to  the  simple,  or  arithmetic,  average  that  Graham
describes in the preceding sentence.

for the long period 1958–1970. But how relevant is this figure, gen-
erally  considered  central  in  common-stock  valuations,  to  the  case
of ALCOA? Its past growth rate was excellent, actually a bit better
than that of acclaimed Sears Roebuck and much higher than that of
the DJIA composite. But the market price at the beginning of 1971
seemed to pay no attention to this fine performance. ALCOA sold
at only 111⁄2 times the recent three-year average, while Sears sold at
27 times and the DJIA itself at 15+ times. How did this come about?
Evidently Wall Street has fairly pessimistic views about the future
course of ALCOA’s earnings, in contrast with its past record. Sur-
prisingly enough, the high price for ALCOA was made as far back
as  1959.  In  that  year  it  sold  at  116,  or  45  times  its  earnings.  (This
compares with a 1959 adjusted high price of 251⁄2 for Sears Roebuck,
or  20  times  its  then  earnings.)  Even  though ALCOA’s  profits  did
show excellent growth thereafter, it is evident that in this case the
future possibilities were greatly overestimated in the market price.
It closed 1970 at exactly half of the 1959 high, while Sears tripled in
price and the DJIA moved up nearly 30%.

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  ALCOA’s  earnings  on  capital
funds* had been only average or less, and this may be the decisive
factor here. High multipliers have been maintained in the stock mar-
ket only if the company has maintained better than average prof-
itability.

* Graham appears to be using “earnings on capital funds” in the traditional
sense  of  return  on  book  value—essentially,  net  income  divided  by  the
company’s tangible net assets.

Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

321

Let us apply at this point to ALCOA the suggestion we made in
the previous chapter for a “two-part appraisal process.”* Such an
approach  might  have  produced  a  “past-performance  value”  for
ALCOA of 10% of the DJIA, or $84 per share relative to the closing
price  of  840  for  the  DJIA in  1970.  On  this  basis  the  shares  would
have appeared quite attractive at their price of 571⁄4.

To what extent should the senior analyst have marked down the
“past-performance value” to allow for adverse developments that
he saw in the future? Frankly, we have no idea. Assume he had rea-
son to believe that the 1971 earnings would be as low as $2.50 per
share—a  large  drop  from  the  1970  figure,  as  against  an  advance
expected for the DJIA. Very likely the stock market would take this
poor performance quite seriously, but would it really establish the
once  mighty  Aluminum  Company  of  America  as  a  relatively
unprofitable enterprise, to be valued at less than its tangible assets
behind the shares?† (In 1971 the price declined from a high of 70 in
May to a low of 36 in December, against a book value of 55.)

ALCOA is  surely  a  representative  industrial  company  of  huge
size,  but  we  think  that  its  price-and-earnings  history  is  more
unusual,  even  contradictory,  than  that  of  most  other  large  enter-
prises.  Yet  this  instance  supports  to  some  degree,  the  doubts  we
expressed in the last chapter as to the dependability of the appraisal
procedure when applied to the typical industrial company.

* See pp. 299–301.
† Recent history—and a mountain of financial research—have shown that the
market is unkindest to rapidly growing companies that suddenly report a fall
in  earnings.  More  moderate  and  stable  growers,  as  ALCOA  was  in
Graham’s  day  or  Anheuser-Busch  and  Colgate-Palmolive  are  in  our  time,
tend to suffer somewhat milder stock declines if they report disappointing
earnings.  Great  expectations  lead  to  great  disappointment  if  they  are  not
met; a failure to meet moderate expectations leads to a much milder reac-
tion. Thus, one of the biggest risks in owning growth stocks is not that their
growth will stop, but merely that it will slow down. And in the long run, that is
not merely a risk, but a virtual certainty.

Even Graham would have been startled by the extent to which compa-
nies and their accountants pushed the limits of propriety in the past
few  years.  Compensated  heavily  through  stock  options,  top  execu-
tives  realized  that  they  could  become  fabulously  rich  merely  by
increasing their company’s earnings for just a few years running.1 Hun-
dreds of companies violated the spirit, if not the letter, of accounting
principles—turning their financial reports into gibberish, tarting up ugly
results with cosmetic fixes, cloaking expenses, or manufacturing earn-
ings out of thin air. Let’s look at some of these unsavory practices.

A S   I F !

Perhaps the most widespread bit of accounting hocus-pocus was the
“pro  forma”  earnings  fad.  There’s  an  old  saying  on  Wall  Street  that
every bad idea starts out as a good idea, and pro forma earnings pre-
sentation is no different. The original point was to provide a truer pic-
ture  of  the  long-term  growth  of  earnings  by  adjusting  for  short-term
deviations from the trend or for supposedly “nonrecurring” events. A
pro  forma  press  release  might,  for  instance,  show  what  a  company
would have earned over the past year if another firm it just acquired
had been part of the family for the entire 12 months.

necessarily outside shareholders—see the commentary on Chapter 19.

But,  as  the  Naughty  1990s  advanced,  companies  just  couldn’t
leave well enough alone. Just look at these examples of pro forma flim-
flam:

•

•

For the quarter ended September 30, 1999, InfoSpace, Inc. pre-
sented its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid $159.9 million
in preferred-stock dividends.
For the quarter ended October 31, 2001, BEA Systems, Inc. pre-
sented its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid $193 million in
payroll taxes on stock options exercised by its employees.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, JDS Uniphase Corp. pre-
sented  its  pro  forma  earnings  as  if  it  had  not  paid  $4  million  in
payroll taxes, had not lost $7 million investing in lousy stocks, and
had not incurred $2.5  billion in charges related to mergers and
goodwill.

In  short,  pro  forma  earnings  enable  companies  to  show  how  well
they might have done if they hadn’t done as badly as they did.2 As an
intelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro forma earn-
ings is ignore them.

In 2000, Qwest Communications International Inc., the telecommuni-
cations giant, looked strong. Its shares dropped less than 5% even as
the stock market lost more than 9% that year.

But  Qwest’s  financial  reports  held  an  odd  little  revelation.  In  late
1999,  Qwest  decided  to  recognize  the  revenues  from  its  telephone
directories as soon as the phone books were published—even though,
as  anyone  who  has  ever  taken  out  a  Yellow  Pages  advertisement
knows,  many  businesses  pay  for  those  ads  in  monthly  installments.

Abracadabra!  That  piddly-sounding  “change  in  accounting  principle”
pumped up 1999 net income by $240 million after taxes—a fifth of all
the money Qwest earned that year.

Like a little chunk of ice crowning a submerged iceberg, aggressive
revenue recognition is often a sign of dangers that run deep and loom
large—and so it was at Qwest. By early 2003, after reviewing its previ-
ous financial statements, the company announced that it had prema-
turely recognized profits on equipment sales, improperly recorded the
costs of services provided by outsiders, inappropriately booked costs
as if they were capital assets rather than expenses, and unjustifiably
treated the exchange of assets as if they were outright sales. All told,
Qwest’s revenues for 2000 and 2001 had been overstated by $2.2
billion—including  $80  million  from  the  earlier  “change  in  accounting
principle,” which was now reversed.3

In the late 1990s, Global Crossing Ltd. had unlimited ambitions. The
Bermuda-based  company  was  building  what  it  called  the  “first  inte-
grated  global  fiber  optic  network”  over  more  than  100,000  miles  of

3 In 2002, Qwest was one of 330 publicly-traded companies to restate past
financial  statements,  an  all-time  record,  according  to  Huron  Consulting
Group.  All  information  on  Qwest  is  taken  from  its  financial  filings  with  the
U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (annual  report,  Form  8K,  and
Form  10-K)  found  in  the  EDGAR  database  at  www.sec.gov.  No  hindsight
was required to detect the “change in accounting principle,” which Qwest
fully disclosed at the time. How did Qwest’s shares do over this period? At
year-end 2000, the stock had been at $41 per share, a total market value of
$67.9 billion. By early 2003, Qwest was around $4, valuing the entire com-
pany at less than $7 billion—a 90% loss. The drop in share price is not the
only cost associated with bogus earnings; a recent study found that a sam-
ple of 27 firms accused of accounting fraud by the SEC had overpaid $320
million in Federal income tax. Although much of that money will eventually be
refunded by the IRS, most shareholders are unlikely to stick around to bene-
fit from the refunds. (See Merle Erickson, Michelle Hanlon, and Edward May-
dew, “How Much Will Firms Pay for Earnings that Do Not Exist?” at http://

cables, largely laid across the floor of the world’s oceans. After wiring
the world, Global Crossing would sell other communications compa-
nies the right to carry their traffic over its network of cables. In 1998
alone, Global Crossing spent more than $600 million to construct its
optical web. That year, nearly a third of the construction budget was
charged  against  revenues  as  an  expense  called  “cost  of  capacity
sold.”  If  not  for  that  $178  million  expense,  Global  Crossing—which
reported a net loss of $96 million—could have reported a net profit of
roughly $82 million.

The  next  year,  says  a  bland  footnote  in  the  1999  annual  report,
Global Crossing “initiated service contract accounting.” The company
would no longer charge most construction costs as expenses against
the  immediate  revenues  it  received  from  selling  capacity  on  its  net-
work. Instead, a major chunk of those construction costs would now
be treated not as an operating expense but as a capital expenditure—
thereby increasing the company’s total assets, instead of decreasing
its net income.4

Poof!  In  one  wave  of  the  wand,  Global  Crossing’s  “property  and
equipment”  assets  rose  by  $575  million,  while  its  cost  of  sales
increased  by  a  mere  $350  million—even  though  the  company  was
spending money like a drunken sailor.

Capital expenditures are an essential tool for managers to make a
good  business  grow  bigger  and  better.  But  malleable  accounting
rules permit managers to inflate reported profits by transforming nor-

4 Global  Crossing  formerly  treated  much  of  its  construction  costs  as  an
expense to be charged against the revenue generated from the sale or lease
of usage rights on its network. Customers generally paid for their rights up
front,  although  some  could  pay  in  installments  over  periods  of  up  to  four
years.  But  Global  Crossing  did  not  book  most  of  the  revenues  up  front,
instead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease. Now, however, because
the networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25 years, Global Cross-
ing began treating them as depreciable, long-lived capital assets. While this
treatment  conforms  with  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles,  it  is
unclear why Global Crossing did not use it before October 1, 1999, or what
exactly  prompted  the  change.  As  of  March  2001,  Global  Crossing  had  a
total  stock  valuation  of  $12.6  billion;  the  company  filed  for  bankruptcy  on
January 28, 2002, rendering its common stock essentially worthless.

case  shows,  the  intelligent  investor  should  be  sure  to  understand
what, and why, a company capitalizes.

Like  many  makers  of  semiconductor  chips,  Micron  Technology,  Inc.
suffered a drop in sales after 2000. In fact, Micron was hit so hard by
the plunge in demand that it had to start writing down the value of its
inventories—since  customers  clearly  did  not  want  them  at  the  prices
Micron  had  been  asking.  In  the  quarter  ended  May  2001,  Micron
slashed  the  recorded  value  of  its  inventories  by  $261  million.  Most
investors interpreted the write-down not as a normal or recurring cost
of operations, but as an unusual event.

Micron  booked  further  inventory  write-downs  in  every  one  of  the

In 2001, SBC Communications, Inc., which owns interests in Cingular
Wireless, PacTel, and Southern New England Telephone, earned $7.2
billion  in  net  income—a  stellar  performance  in  a  bad  year  for  the
overextended  telecom  industry.  But  that  gain  didn’t  come  only  from
SBC’s  business.  Fully  $1.4  billion  of  it—13%  of  the  company’s  net
income—came from SBC’s pension plan.

Because  SBC  had  more  money  in  the  pension  plan  than  it  esti-
mated was necessary to pay its employees’ future benefits, the com-
pany got to treat the difference as current income. One simple reason
for that surplus: In 2001, SBC raised the rate of return it expected to
earn on the pension plan’s investments from 8.5% to 9.5%—lowering
the amount of money it needed to set aside today.

SBC explained its rosy new expectations by noting that “for each
of  the  three  years  ended  2001,  our  actual  10-year  return  on  invest-
ments  exceeded  10%.”  In  other  words,  our  past  returns  have  been
high, so let’s assume that our future returns will be too. But that not
only flunked the most rudimentary tests of logic, it flew in the face of
the fact that interest rates were falling to near-record lows, depressing
the future returns on the bond portion of a pension portfolio.

The same year, in fact, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway low-
ered the expected rate of return on its pension assets from 8.3% to
6.5%. Was SBC being realistic in assuming that its pension-fund man-
agers  could  significantly  outperform  the  world’s  greatest  investor?
Probably  not:  In  2001,  Berkshire  Hathaway’s  pension  fund  gained
9.8%, but SBC’s pension fund lost 6.9%.6

5 I am grateful to Howard Schilit and Mark Hamel of the Center for Financial
Research and Analysis for providing this example.
6 Returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan assets at
the beginning of the year by “actual return on plan assets.”

Commentary on Chapter 12

Here are some quick considerations for the intelligent investor: Is
the “net pension benefit” more than 5% of the company’s net income?
(If so, would you still be comfortable with the company’s other earn-
ings  if  those  pension  gains  went  away  in  future  years?) Is  the
assumed “long-term rate of return on plan assets” reasonable? (As of
2003,  anything  above  6.5%  is  implausible,  while  a  rising  rate  is
downright delusional.)

A few pointers will help you avoid buying a stock that turns out to be
an accounting time bomb:

Read  backwards. When  you  research  a  company’s  financial
reports,  start  reading  on  the  last  page  and  slowly  work  your  way
toward the front. Anything that the company doesn’t want you to find
is  buried  in  the  back—which  is  precisely  why  you  should  look  there
first.

Read the notes. Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes
to the financial statements in the annual report. Usually labeled “sum-
mary of significant accounting policies,” one key note describes how
the  company  recognizes  revenue,  records  inventories,  treats  install-
ment  or  contract  sales,  expenses  its  marketing  costs,  and  accounts
for  the  other  major  aspects  of  its  business.7 In  the  other  footnotes,

7 Do not be put off by the stupefyingly boring verbiage of accounting foot-
notes.  They  are  designed  expressly  to  deter  normal  people  from  actually
reading  them—which  is  why  you  must  persevere.  A  footnote  to  the  1996
annual report of Informix Corp., for instance, disclosed that “The Company
generally recognizes license revenue from sales of software licenses upon
delivery of the software product to a customer. However, for certain com-
puter  hardware  manufacturers  and  end-user  licensees  with  amounts
payable  within  twelve  months,  the  Company  will  recognize  revenue  at  the
time  the  customer  makes  a  contractual  commitment  for  a  minimum  non-
refundable license fee, if such computer hardware manufacturers and end-
user  licensees  meet  certain  criteria  established  by  the  Company.”  In  plain
English, Informix was saying that it would credit itself for revenues on prod-
ucts  even  if  they  had  not  yet  been  resold  to  “end-users”  (the  actual  cus-
tomers for Informix’s software). Amid allegations by the U.S. Securities and

watch for disclosures about debt, stock options, loans to customers,

chomp  out  of  earnings.  Among  the  things  that  should  make  your
antennae twitch are technical terms like “capitalized,” “deferred,” and
“restructuring”—and  plain-English  words  signaling  that  the  company
has altered its accounting practices, like “began,” “change,” and “how-
ever.” None of those words mean you should not buy the stock, but all
mean  that  you  need  to  investigate  further.  Be  sure  to  compare  the
footnotes  with  those  in  the  financial  statements  of  at  least  one  firm
that’s  a  close  competitor,  to  see  how  aggressive  your  company’s
accountants are.

Read more. If you are an enterprising investor willing to put plenty
of time and energy into your portfolio, then you owe it to yourself to
learn more about financial reporting. That’s the only way to minimize
your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement. Three solid
books full of timely and specific examples are Martin Fridson and Fer-
nando  Alvarez’s  Financial  Statement  Analysis, Charles  Mulford  and
Eugene  Comiskey’s  The  Financial  Numbers  Game, and  Howard
Schilit’s Financial Shenanigans.8

Exchange  Commission  that  Informix  had  committed  accounting  fraud,  the
company  later  restated  its  revenues,  wiping  away  $244  million  in  such
“sales.” This case is a keen reminder of the importance of reading the fine
print with a skeptical eye. I am indebted to Martin Fridson for suggesting this
example.
8 Martin  Fridson  and  Fernando  Alvarez,  Financial  Statement  Analysis:  A
Practitioner’s Guide (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2002); Charles W. Mul-
ford  and  Eugene  E.  Comiskey,  The  Financial  Numbers  Game:  Detecting
Creative  Accounting  Practices (John  Wiley  &  Sons,  New  York,  2002);

Benjamin  Graham’s  own  book,  The  Interpretation  of  Financial  Statements
(HarperBusiness,  New  York,  1998  reprint  of  1937  edition),  remains  an
excellent brief introduction to the basic principles of earnings and expenses,
assets and liabilities.

CHAPTER 13

A Comparison of Four Listed Companies

In  this  chapter  we  should  like  to  present  a  sample  of  security
analysis  in  operation.  We  have  selected,  more  or  less  at  random,
four  companies  which  are  found  successively  on  the  New  York
Stock  Exchange  list.  These  are  eltra Corp.  (a  merger  of  Electric
Autolite and Mergenthaler Linotype enterprises), Emerson Electric
Co. (a manufacturer of electric and electronic products), Emery Air
Freight  (a  domestic  forwarder  of  air  freight),  and  Emhart  Corp.
(originally  a  maker  of  bottling  machinery  only,  but  now  also  in
builders’ hardware).* There are some broad resemblances between
the three manufacturing firms, but the differences will seem more
significant. There should be sufficient variety in the financial and
operating data to make the examination of interest.

In Table 13-1 we present a summary of what the four companies
were selling for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures
on their 1970 operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which
relate  on  the  one  hand  to  performance and  on  the  other  to  price.
Comment is called for on how various aspects of the performance
pattern agree with the relative price pattern. Finally, we shall pass
the  four  companies  in  review,  suggesting  some  comparisons  and
relationships and evaluating each in terms of the requirements of a
conservative common-stock investor.

* Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in the same
form. ELTRA Corp.  is  no  longer  an  independent  company;  it  merged  with
Bunker  Ramo  Corp.  in  the  1970s,  putting  it  in  the  business  of  supplying
stock  quotes  to  brokerage  firms  across  an  early  network  of  computers.
What remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell Corp. The firm
formerly known as Emery Air Freight is now a division of CNF Inc. Emhart
Corp. was acquired by Black & Decker Corp. in 1989.

The  most  striking  fact  about  the  four  companies  is  that  the 
current  price/earnings  ratios  vary  much  more  widely  than  their
operating  performance  or  financial  condition.  Two  of  the  enter-
prises—eltra and  Emhart—were  modestly  priced  at  only  9.7
times and 12 times the average earnings for 1968–1970, as against a
similar figure of 15.5 times for the DJIA. The other two—Emerson
and Emery—showed very high multiples of 33 and 45 times such
earnings.  There  is  bound  to  be  some  explanation  of  a  difference
such as this, and it is found in the superior growth of the favored
companies’  profits  in  recent  years,  especially  by  the  freight  for-
warder.  (But  the  growth  figures  of  the  other  two  firms  were  not
unsatisfactory.)

For  more  comprehensive  treatment  let  us  review  briefly  the

chief elements of performance as they appear from our figures.

A Comparison of Four Listed Companies

333

1. Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings
on  their  book  value,  but  the  figures  for  Emerson  and  Emery  are
much  higher  than  for  the  other  two.  A high  rate  of  return  on
invested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in
earnings per share.* All the companies except Emery showed bet-
ter earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery fig-
ure  was  exceptionally  large  in  both  years.  (b)  For  manufacturing
companies, the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica-
tion of comparative strength or weakness. We use here the “ratio of
operating  income  to  sales,”  as  given  in  Standard  &  Poor’s  Listed
Stock  Reports. Here  again  the  results  are  satisfactory  for  all  four
companies,  with  an  especially  impressive  showing  by  Emerson.
The changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the
companies.

2. Stability. This  we  measure  by  the  maximum  decline  in  per-
share earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the aver-
age  of  the  three  preceding  years.  No  decline  translates  into  100%
stability, and this was registered by the two popular concerns. But
the  shrinkages  of  eltra and  Emhart  were  quite  moderate  in  the
“poor year” 1970, amounting to only 8% each by our measurement,
against 7% for the DJIA.

3. Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satis-
factory growth rates, in both cases doing better than the Dow Jones
group.  The  eltra figures  are  especially  impressive  when  set
against its low price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more
impressive for the high-multiplier pair.

4. Financial Position. The three manufacturing companies are in
sound financial condition, having better than the standard ratio of
$2 of current assets for $1 of current liabilities. Emery Air Freight
has a lower ratio; but it falls in a different category, and with its fine
record it would have no problem raising needed cash. All the com-
panies have relatively low long-term debt. “Dilution” note: Emer-
son  Electric  had  $163  million  of  market  value  of  low-dividend

* This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value” in Table
13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage of their
tangible book value.

convertible  preferred  shares  outstanding  at  the  end  of  1970.  In 
our  analysis  we  have  made  allowance  for  the  dilution  factor  in 
the  usual  way  by  treating  the  preferred  as  if  converted  into  com-
mon. This decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents per share, or
some 4%.

5. Dividends. What  really  counts  is  the  history  of  continuance
without interruption. The best record here is Emhart’s, which has
not suspended a payment since 1902. eltra’s record is very good,
Emerson’s  quite  satisfactory,  Emery  Freight  is  a  newcomer.  The
variations in payout percentage do not seem especially significant.
The current dividend yield is twice as high on the “cheap pair” as
on the “dear pair,” corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.

6. Price History. The reader should be impressed by the percent-
age advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as mea-
sured  from  the  lowest  to  the  highest  points  during  the  past  34
years. (In all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent
stock splits.) Note that for the DJIA the range from low to high was
on  the  order  of  11  to  1;  for  our  companies  the  spread  has  varied
from “only” 17 to 1 for Emhart to no less than 528 to 1 for Emery
Air  Freight.*  These  manifold  price  advances  are  characteristic  of
most  of  our  older  common-stock  issues,  and  they  proclaim  the
great opportunities of profit that have existed in the stock markets
of  the  past.  (But  they  may  indicate  also  how  overdone  were  the
declines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were
registered.) Both eltra and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of
more than 50% in the 1969–70 price break. Emerson and Emery had
serious,  but  less  distressing,  declines;  the  former  rebounded  to  a
new all-time high before the end of 1970, the latter in early 1971.

* In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and dividing
the high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price. For example,
Emery’s  high  price  of  66  divided  by  its  low  price  of  1/8  equals  528,  or  a
ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.

General Observations on the Four Companies

Emerson Electric has an enormous total market value, dwarfing
the  other  three  companies  combined.*  It  is  one  of  our  “good-will
giants,” to be commented on later. A financial analyst blessed (or
handicapped)  with  a  good  memory  will  think  of  an  analogy
between Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would not be
reassuring.  For  Zenith  had  a  brilliant  growth  record  for  many
years; it too sold in the market for $1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof-
its fell from $43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in
that year’s big selloff its price declined to 221⁄2 against the previous
top of 89. High valuations entail high risks.

Emery Air Freight must be the most promising of the four compa-
nies in terms of future growth, if the price/earnings ratio of nearly 40
times  its  highest  reported  earnings  is  to  be  even  partially  justified.
The past growth, of course, has been most impressive. But these fig-
ures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they
started quite small, at only $570,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often
proves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after
volume  and  profits  have  already  expanded  to  big  totals.  The  most
surprising  aspect  of  Emery’s  story  is  that  its  earnings  and  market
price continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year in
the  domestic  air-passenger  industry.  This  is  a  remarkable  achieve-
ment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits may
not be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-
petition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air-
lines,  etc.  An  elaborate  study  might  be  needed  before  a  sound
judgment  could  be  passed  on  these  points,  but  the  conservative
investor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.

Emhart and eltra. Emhart has done better in its business than in
the stock market over the past 14 years. In 1958 it sold as high as 22
times the current earnings—about the same ratio as for the DJIA.
Since then its profits tripled, as against a rise of less than 100% for
the  Dow,  but  its  closing  price  in  1970  was  only  a  third  above  the

* At the end of 1970, Emerson’s $1.6 billion in market value truly was “enor-
mous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002, Emerson’s
common stock had a total market value of approximately $21 billion.

1958 high, versus 43% for the Dow. The record of eltra is some-
what similar. It appears that neither of these companies possesses
glamour, or “sex appeal,” in the present market; but in all the sta-
tistical  data  they  show  up  surprisingly  well.  Their  future  pros-
pects?  We  have  no  sage  remarks  to  make  here,  but  this  is  what
Standard & Poor’s had to say about the four companies in 1971:

eltra—“Long-term Prospects: Certain operations are cyclical, but an
established  competitive  position  and  diversification  are  offsetting  fac-
tors.”

Emerson  Electric—“While  adequately  priced  (at  71)  on  the  current
outlook, the shares have appeal for the long term. . . . A continued acqui-
sition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields and an
accelerated  international  program  suggests  further  sales  and  earnings
progress.”

Emery Air Freight—“The shares appear amply priced (at 57) on cur-

rent prospects, but are well worth holding for the long pull.”

Emhart—“Although restricted this year by lower capital spending in
the glass-container industry, earnings should be aided by an improved
business environment in 1972. The shares are worth holding (at 34).”

Conclusions: Many  financial  analysts  will  find  Emerson  and
Emery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—
primarily,  perhaps,  because  of  their  better  “market  action,”  and
secondarily  because  of  their  faster  recent  growth  in  earnings.
Under  our  principles  of  conservative  investment  the  first  is  not  a
valid reason for selection—that is something for the speculators to
play around with. The second has validity, but within limits. Can
the past growth and the presumably good prospects of Emery Air
Freight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings?1 Our
answer would be: Maybe for someone who has made an in-depth
study of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep-
tionally  firm  and  optimistic  conclusions.  But  not for  the  careful
investor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he is not
committing  the  typical  Wall  Street  error  of  overenthusiasm  for
good performance in earnings and in the stock market.* The same

* Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most fashionable
and  highly  valued  in  1972,  Emery  fared  among  the  worst.  The  March  1,

cautionary statements seem called for in the case of Emerson Elec-
tric,  with  a  special  reference  to  the  market’s  current  valuation  of
over  a  billion  dollars  for  the  intangible,  or  earning-power,  factor
here.  We  should  add  that  the  “electronics  industry,”  once  a  fair-
haired child of the stock market, has in general fallen on disastrous
days. Emerson is an outstanding exception, but it will have to con-
tinue to be such an exception for a great many years in the future
before  the  1970  closing  price  will  have  been  fully  justified  by  its
subsequent performance.

By  contrast,  both  eltra at  27  and  Emhart  at  33  have  the  ear-
marks of companies with sufficient value behind their price to con-
stitute reasonably protected investments. Here the investor can, if
he  wishes,  consider  himself  basically  a  part  owner  of  these  busi-
nesses, at a cost corresponding to what the balance sheet shows to
be  the  money  invested  therein.*  The  rate  of  earnings  on  invested
capital  has  long  been  satisfactory;  the  stability  of  profits  also;  the
past growth rate surprisingly so. The two companies will meet our
seven statistical requirements for inclusion in a defensive investor’s
portfolio. These will be developed in the next chapter, but we sum-
marize them as follows:

1. Adequate size.
2. A sufficiently strong financial condition.
3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years.
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years.

1982, issue of Forbes reported that since 1972 Emery had lost 72.8% of its
value after inflation. By late 1974, according to the investment researchers
at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s stock had already fallen 58%
and  its  price/earnings  ratio  had  plummeted  from  64  times  to  just  15.  The
“overenthusiasm”  Graham  had  warned  against  was  eviscerated  in  short
order. Can the passage of time make up for this kind of excess? Not always:
Leuthold calculated that $1000 invested in Emery in 1972 would be worth
only $839 as of 1999. It’s likely that the people who overpaid for Internet
stocks  in  the  late  1990s  will  not  break  even  for  decades—if  ever  (see  the
commentary on Chapter 20).
* Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an investor could
buy shares in these two companies for little more than their book value, as
shown in the third line of Section B in Table 13-2.

The Intelligent Investor

5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings.
6. Price of stock no more than 11⁄2 times net asset value.
7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three

years.

We make no predictions about the future earnings performance
of eltra or  Emhart.  In  the  investor’s  diversified  list  of  common
stocks  there  are  bound  to  be  some  that  prove  disappointing,  and
this may be the case for one or both of this pair. But the diversified
list itself, based on the above principles of selection, plus whatever
other sensible criteria the investor may wish to apply, should per-
form  well  enough  across  the  years. At  least,  long  experience  tells 
us so.

A final observation: An experienced security analyst, even if he
accepted  our  general  reasoning  on  these  four  companies,  would
have hesitated to recommend that a holder of Emerson or Emery
exchange his shares for eltra or Emhart at the end of 1970—unless
the  holder  understood  clearly  the  philosophy  behind  the  recom-
mendation. There was no reason to expect that in any short period
of  time  the  low-multiplier  duo  would  outperform  the  high-
multipliers. The latter were well thought of in the market and thus
had  a  considerable  degree  of  momentum  behind  them,  which
might continue for an indefinite period. The sound basis for prefer-
ring eltra and  Emhart  to  Emerson  and  Emery  would  be  the
client’s considered conclusion that he preferred value-type invest-
ments to glamour-type investments. Thus, to a substantial extent,
common-stock  investment  policy  must  depend  on  the  attitude  of
the individual investor. This approach is treated at greater length
in our next chapter.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 13

In the Air Force we have a rule: check six. A guy is flying along,
looking in all directions, and feeling very safe. Another guy flies
up behind him (at “6 o’clock”—“12 o’clock” is directly in front)
and shoots. Most airplanes are shot down that way. Thinking
that you’re safe is very dangerous! Somewhere, there’s a weak-
ness you’ve got to find. You must always check six o’clock.

—U.S. Air Force Gen. Donald Kutyna

As  Graham  did,  let’s  compare  and  contrast  four  stocks,  using  their
reported numbers as of December 31, 1999—a time that will enable
us  to  view  some  of  the  most  drastic  extremes  of  valuation  ever
recorded in the stock market.

Emerson Electric Co. (ticker symbol: EMR) was founded in 1890
and  is  the  only  surviving  member  of  Graham’s  original  quartet; 
it  makes  a  wide  array  of  products,  including  power  tools,  air-
conditioning equipment, and electrical motors.

EMC Corp. (ticker symbol: EMC) dates back to 1979 and enables
companies  to  automate  the  storage  of  electronic  information  over
computer networks.

Expeditors  International  of  Washington,  Inc.

(ticker  symbol:
EXPD), founded in Seattle in 1979, helps shippers organize and track
the movement of goods around the world.

Exodus  Communications,  Inc. (ticker  symbol:  EXDS)  hosts  and
manages websites for corporate customers, along with other Internet
services; it first sold shares to the public in March 1998.

This  table  summarizes  the  price,  performance,  and  valuation  of

these companies as of year-end 1999:

E L E C T R I C ,   N O T   E L E C T R I F Y I N G

The most expensive of Graham’s four stocks, Emerson Electric, ended
up as the cheapest in our updated group. With its base in Old Econ-
omy industries, Emerson looked boring in the late 1990s. (In the Inter-
net Age, who cared about Emerson’s heavy-duty wet-dry vacuums?)
The company’s shares went into suspended animation. In 1998 and
1999, Emerson’s stock lagged the S & P 500 index by a cumulative
49.7 percentage points, a miserable underperformance.

But  that  was  Emerson  the  stock.  What  about  Emerson  the  com-
pany? In 1999, Emerson sold $14.4 billion worth of goods and ser-
vices,  up  nearly  $1  billion  from  the  year  before.  On  those  revenues
Emerson  earned  $1.3  billion  in  net  income,  or  6.9%  more  than  in
1998. Over the previous five years, earnings per share had risen at a
robust average rate of 8.3%. Emerson’s dividend had more than dou-
bled to $1.30 per share; book value had gone from $6.69 to $14.27
per share. According to Value Line, throughout the 1990s, Emerson’s
net profit margin and return on capital—key measures of its efficiency
as a business—had stayed robustly high, around 9% and 18% respec-
tively. What’s more, Emerson had increased its earnings for 42 years
in a row and had raised its dividend for 43 straight years—one of the
longest  runs  of  steady  growth  in  American  business.  At  year-end,
Emerson’s stock was priced at 17.7 times the company’s net income
per share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never flashy, but it was
reliable—and showed no sign of overheating.

C O U L D   E M C   G R O W   P D Q ?

EMC  Corp.  was  one  of  the  best-performing  stocks  of  the  1990s, 
rising—or  should  we  say  levitating?—more  than  81,000%.  If  you  had
invested  $10,000  in  EMC’s  stock  at  the  beginning  of  1990,  you
would  have  ended  1999  with  just  over  $8.1  million.  EMC’s  shares
returned  157.1%  in  1999  alone—more  than  Emerson’s  stock  had
gained in the eight years from 1992 through 1999 combined. EMC
had never paid a dividend, instead retaining all its earnings “to provide
funds for the continued growth of the company.” 1 At their December

1 As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in practice, “to pro-
vide funds for the continued growth of the company’s top managers’ wealth.”

Commentary on Chapter 13

31  price  of  $54.625,  EMC’s  shares  were  trading  at  103  times  the
earnings the company would report for the full year—nearly six times
the valuation level of Emerson’s stock.

What about EMC the business? Revenues grew 24% in 1999, ris-
ing to $6.7 billion. Its earnings per share soared to 92 cents from 61
cents the year before, a 51% increase. Over the five years ending in
1999,  EMC’s  earnings  had  risen  at  a  sizzling  annual  rate  of  28.8%.
And, with everyone expecting the tidal wave of Internet commerce to
keep rolling, the future looked even brighter. Throughout 1999, EMC’s
chief executive repeatedly predicted that revenues would hit $10 bil-
lion by 2001—up from $5.4 billion in 1998.2 That would require aver-
age annual growth of 23%, a monstrous rate of expansion for so big a
company.  But  Wall  Street’s  analysts,  and  most  investors,  were  sure
EMC could do it. After all, over the previous five years, EMC had more
than doubled its revenues and better than tripled its net income.

But from 1995 through 1999, according to Value Line, EMC’s net
profit  margin  slid  from  19.0%  to  17.4%,  while  its  return  on  capital
dropped  from  26.8%  to  21%.  Although  still  highly  profitable,  EMC
was already slipping. And in October 1999, EMC acquired Data Gen-
eral Corp., which added roughly $1.1 billion to EMC’s revenues that
year.  Simply  by  subtracting  the  extra  revenues  brought  in  from  Data
General,  we  can  see  that  the  volume  of  EMC’s  existing  businesses
grew from $5.4 billion in 1998 to just $5.6 billion in 1999, a rise of
only  3.6%.  In  other  words,  EMC’s  true  growth  rate  was  almost  nil—
even in a year when the scare over the “Y2K” computer bug had led

2 Appearing  on  CNBC  on  December  30,  1999,  EMC’s  chief  executive,
Michael  Ruettgers,  was  asked  by  host  Ron  Insana  whether  “2000  and
beyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like it’s
accelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock was
overvalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the opportunity
we have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited. . . . So while it’s hard to predict
whether  these  things  are  overpriced,  there’s  such  a  major  change  taking
place that if you could find the winners today—and I certainly think EMC is
one of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in the future.”

Unlike  EMC,  Expeditors  International  hadn’t  yet  learned  to  levitate.
Although the firm’s shares had risen 30% annually in the 1990s, much
of  that  big  gain  had  come  at  the  very  end,  as  the  stock  raced  to  a
109.1% return in 1999. The year before, Expeditors’ shares had gone
up just 9.5%, trailing the S & P 500 index by more than 19 percentage
points.

What  about  the  business?  Expeditors  was  growing  expeditiously
indeed: Since 1995, its revenues had risen at an average annual rate
of 19.8%, nearly tripling over the period to finish 1999 at $1.4 billion.
And earnings per share had grown by 25.8% annually, while dividends
had risen at a 27% annual clip. Expeditors had no long-term debt, and
its working capital had nearly doubled since 1995. According to Value
Line,  Expeditors’  book  value  per  share  had  increased  129%  and  its
return on capital had risen by more than one-third to 21%.

By any standard, Expeditors was a superb business. But the little
freight-forwarding  company,  with  its  base  in  Seattle  and  much  of  its
operations in Asia, was all-but-unknown on Wall Street. Only 32% of
the  shares  were  owned  by  institutional  investors;  in  fact,  Expeditors
had only 8,500 shareholders. After doubling in 1999, the stock was
priced at 39 times the net income Expeditors would earn for the year—
no longer anywhere near cheap, but well below the vertiginous valua-
tion of EMC.

By the end of 1999, Exodus Communications seemed to have taken
its  shareholders  straight  to  the  land  of  milk  and  honey.  The  stock
soared 1,005.8% in 1999—enough to turn a $10,000 investment on
January  1  into  more  than  $110,000  by  December  31.  Wall  Street’s

lars in 1999 to ensure that their computers would be “Y2K-compliant.” In the

Commentary on Chapter 13

Blodget  of  Merrill  Lynch,  were  predicting  that  the  stock  would  rise
another 25% to 125% over the coming year.

And  best  of  all,  in  the  eyes  of  the  online  traders  who  gorged  on
Exodus’s  gains,  was  the  fact  that  the  stock  had  split  2-for-1  three
times  during  1999.  In  a  2-for-1  stock  split,  a  company  doubles  the
number of its shares and halves their price—so a shareholder ends up
owning  twice  as  many  shares,  each  priced  at  half  the  former  level.
What’s so great about that? Imagine that you handed me a dime, and
I  then  gave  you  back  two  nickels  and  asked,  “Don’t  you  feel  richer
now?” You would probably conclude either that I was an idiot, or that I
had  mistaken  you  for  one.  And  yet,  in  1999’s  frenzy  over  dot-com
stocks, online traders acted exactly as if two nickels were more valu-
able than one dime. In fact, just the news that a stock would be split-
ting 2-for-1 could instantly drive its shares up 20% or more.

Why?  Because  getting  more  shares  makes  people  feel richer.
Someone who bought 100 shares of Exodus in January watched them
turn into 200 when the stock split in April; then those 200 turned into
400 in August; then the 400 became 800 in December. It was thrilling
for these people to realize that they had gotten 700 more shares just
for owning 100 in the first place. To them, that felt like “found money”—
never  mind  that  the  price  per  share  had  been  cut  in  half  with  each
split.4 In December, 1999, one elated Exodus shareholder, who went
by  the  handle  “givemeadollar,”  exulted  on  an  online  message  board:
“I’m  going  to  hold  these  shares  until  I’m  80,  [because]  after  it  splits
hundreds  of  times  over  the  next  years,  I’ll  be  close  to  becoming
CEO.” 5

What about Exodus the business? Graham wouldn’t have touched
it  with  a  10-foot  pole  and  a  haz-mat  suit.  Exodus’s  revenues  were
exploding—growing  from  $52.7  million  in  1998  to  $242.1  million  in
1999—but  it  lost  $130.3  million  on  those  revenues  in  1999,  nearly
double its loss the year before. Exodus had $2.6 billion in total debt—
and  was  so  starved  for  cash  that  it  borrowed  $971  million  in  the

month of December alone. According to Exodus’s annual report, that
new  borrowing  would  add  more  than  $50  million  to  its  interest  pay-
ments in the coming year. The company started 1999 with $156 mil-
lion  in  cash  and,  even  after  raising  $1.3  billion  in  new  financing,
finished  the  year  with  a  cash  balance  of  $1  billion—meaning  that  its
businesses  had  devoured  more  than  $400  million  in  cash  during
1999. How could such a company ever pay its debts?

But,  of  course,  online  traders  were  fixated  on  how  far  and  fast  the
stock had risen, not on whether the company was healthy. “This stock,”
bragged a trader using the screen name of “Launch_Pad1999,” “will just
continue climbing to infinity and beyond.” 6

The absurdity of Launch_Pad’s prediction—what is “beyond” infin-
ity?—is  the  perfect  reminder  of  one  of  Graham’s  classic  warnings.
“Today’s investor,” Graham tells us,

is  so  concerned  with  anticipating  the  future  that  he  is  already  paying
handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has projected with so much
study and care may actually happen and still not bring him any profit. If it
should fail to materialize to the degree expected he may in fact be faced
with a serious temporary and perhaps even permanent loss.” 7

How did these four stocks perform after 1999?

Emerson  Electric  went  on  to  gain  40.7%  in  2000.  Although  the
shares lost money in both 2001 and 2002, they nevertheless ended
2002 less than 4% below their final price of 1999.

EMC also rose in 2000, gaining 21.7%. But then the shares lost
79.4%  in  2001  and  another  54.3%  in  2002.  That  left  them  88%
below their level at year-end 1999. What about the forecast of $10
billion in revenues by 2001? EMC finished that year with revenues of
just $7.1 billion (and a net loss of $508 million).

Meanwhile,  as  if  the  bear  market  did  not  even  exist,  Expeditors
International’s shares went on to gain 22.9% in 2000, 6.5% in 2001,
and  another  15.1%  in  2002—finishing  that  year  nearly  51%  higher
than their price at the end of 1999.

Exodus’s stock lost 55% in 2000 and 99.8% in 2001. On Septem-
ber  26,  2001,  Exodus  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  protection.
Most of the company’s assets were bought by Cable & Wireless, the
British  telecommunications  giant.  Instead  of  delivering  its  sharehold-
ers to the promised land, Exodus left them exiled in the wilderness. As
of  early  2003,  the  last  trade  in  Exodus’s  stock  was  at  one  penny  a
share.

CHAPTER 14

Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

It is time to turn to some broader applications of the techniques of
security analysis. Since we have already described in general terms
the  investment  policies  recommended  for  our  two  categories  of
investors,* it would be logical for us now to indicate how security
analysis comes into play in order to implement these policies. The
defensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only
high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks.
He is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is
not unduly high as judged by applicable standards.

In  setting  up  this  diversified  list  he  has  a  choice  of  two
approaches,  the  DJIA-type  of  portfolio  and  the  quantitatively-
tested portfolio. In the first he acquires a true cross-section sample
of the leading issues, which will include both some favored growth
companies,  whose  shares  sell  at  especially  high  multipliers,  and
also  less  popular  and  less  expensive  enterprises.  This  could  be
done,  most  simply  perhaps,  by  buying  the  same  amounts  of  all
thirty of the issues in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Ten
shares  of  each,  at  the  900  level  for  the  average,  would  cost  an
aggregate  of  about  $16,000.1 On  the  basis  of  the  past  record  he
might  expect  approximately  the  same  future  results  by  buying
shares of several representative investment funds.†

His second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each

* Graham  describes  his  recommended  investment  policies  in  Chapters  4
through 7.
† As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9, today’s
defensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a low-cost index
fund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total U.S. stock market.

347

The Intelligent Investor

purchase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of quality in
the  past  performance  and  current  financial  position  of  the  com-
pany, and also (2) a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and
assets per dollar of price. At the close of the previous chapter we
listed  seven  such  quality  and  quantity  criteria  suggested  for  the
selection of specific common stocks. Let us describe them in order.

1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise

All our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the
matter  of  size  required.  Our  idea  is  to  exclude  small  companies
which may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially
in  the  industrial  field.  (There  are  often  good  possibilities  in  such
enterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the
defensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than $100
million of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than
$50 million of total assets for a public utility.

2. A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition

For industrial companies current assets should be at least twice
current liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also, long-
term  debt  should  not  exceed  the  net  current  assets  (or  “working
capital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the
stock equity (at book value).

3. Earnings Stability

Some  earnings  for  the  common  stock  in  each  of  the  past  ten

years.

4. Dividend Record

Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.

5. Earnings Growth

A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings
in  the  past  ten  years  using  three-year  averages  at  the  beginning
and end.

Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

349

6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio

Current  price  should  not  be  more  than  15  times  average  earn-

ings of the past three years.

7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets

Current price should not be more than 11⁄2 times the book value last
reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a
correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we
suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to
book  value  should  not  exceed  22.5.  (This  figure  corresponds  to  15
times earnings and 11⁄2 times book value. It would admit an issue sell-
ing at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)

General Comments: These requirements are set up especially
for  the  needs  and  the  temperament  of  defensive  investors.  They
will  eliminate  the  great  majority  of  common  stocks  as  candidates
for the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand they
will exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak
financial  condition,  (3)  with  a  deficit  stigma  in  their  ten-year
record, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.
Of these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are
those of financial strength. A considerable number of our large and
formerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-
rent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.

Our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by
demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than
the  popular  issues  will  supply.  This  is  by  no  means  the  standard
viewpoint  of  financial  analysts;  in  fact  most  will  insist  that  even
conservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices
for  stocks  of  the  choice  companies.  We  have  expounded  our  con-
trary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-
tor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on
ever-increasing  earnings  in  the  future.  The  reader  will  have  to
decide  this  important  question  for  himself—after  weighing  the
arguments on both sides.

We have  nonetheless  opted  for  the  inclusion  of  a  modest
requirement of growth over the past decade. Without it the typical
company would show retrogression, at least in terms of profit per

350

The Intelligent Investor

dollar  of  invested  capital.  There  is  no  reason  for  the  defensive
investor  to  include  such  companies—though  if  the  price  is  low
enough they could qualify as bargain opportunities.

The suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well
result in a typical portfolio with an average multiplier of, say, 12 to
13 times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. & Tel. sold at 11
times  its  three-year  (and  current)  earnings,  and  Standard  Oil  of
California  at  less  than  10  times  latest  earnings.  Our  basic  recom-
mendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have
an  overall  earnings/price  ratio—the  reverse  of  the  P/E  ratio—at
least as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean
a P/E ratio no higher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5%.*

Application of Our Criteria to the DJIA at the End of 1970

All of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIA issues at
the end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based
on  the  closing  price  of  1970  and  the  relevant  figures.  (The  basic
data for each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)

1. Size is more than ample for each company.
2. Financial  condition  is  adequate  in  the  aggregate, but  not  for

every company.2

3. Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least
1940. Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.

* In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was around
4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio should have
an earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the inverse of that num-
ber (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a “suggested maximum” P/E
ratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this paragraph Graham recommends that
the “average” stock be priced about 20% below the “maximum” ratio. That
suggests that—in general—Graham would consider stocks selling at no more
than 17 times their three-year average earnings to be potentially attractive
given  today’s  interest  rates  and  market  conditions.  As  of  December  31,
2002, more than 200—or better than 40%—of the stocks in the S & P 500-
stock index had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower. Updated AA
bond yields can be found at www.bondtalk.com.

The Intelligent Investor

4. The  aggregate  earnings  have  been  quite  stable  in  the  past
decade.  None  of  the  companies  reported  a  deficit  during  the
prosperous  period  1961–69,  but  Chrysler  showed  a  small
deficit in 1970.

5. The  total  growth—comparing  three-year  averages  a  decade
apart—was 77%, or about 6% per year. But five of the firms did
not grow by one-third.

6. The ratio of year-end price to three-year average earnings was
839 to $55.5 or 15 to 1—right at our suggested upper limit.
7. The ratio of price to net asset value was 839 to 562—also just

within our suggested limit of 11⁄2 to 1.

If,  however,  we  wish  to  apply  the  same  seven  criteria  to  each
individual company, we would find that only five of them would
meet all our requirements. These would be: American Can, Ameri-
can  Tel.  &  Tel.,  Anaconda,  Swift,  and  Woolworth.  The  totals  for
these five appear in Table 14-3. Naturally they make a much better
statistical  showing  than  the  DJIA as  a  whole,  except  in  the  past
growth rate.3

Our application of specific criteria to this select group of indus-
trial  stocks  indicates  that  the  number  meeting  every  one  of  our
tests  will  be  a  relatively  small  percentage  of  all listed  industrial
issues. We hazard the guess that about 100 issues of this sort could
have been found in the Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide at the end of
1970, just about enough to provide the investor with a satisfactory
range of personal choice.*

The Public-Utility “Solution”

If  we  turn  now  to  the  field  of  public-utility  stocks  we  find  a
much  more  comfortable  and  inviting  situation  for  the  investor.†

* An easy-to-use online stock screener that can sort the stocks in the S & P
500  by  most  of  Graham’s  criteria  is  available  at:  www.quicken.com/

† When  Graham  wrote,  only  one  major  mutual  fund  specializing  in  utility
stocks—Franklin  Utilities—was  widely  available.  Today  there  are  more  than
30. Graham could not have anticipated the financial havoc wrought by can-

The Intelligent Investor

Here the vast majority of issues appear to be cut out, by their per-
formance  record  and  their  price  ratios,  in  accordance  with  the
defensive investor’s needs as we judge them. We exclude one crite-
rion  from  our  tests  of  public-utility  stocks—namely,  the  ratio  of
current assets to current liabilities. The working-capital factor takes
care of itself in this industry as part of the continuous financing of
its growth by sales of bonds and shares. We do require an adequate
proportion of stock capital to debt.4

In Table 14-4 we present a résumé of the 15 issues in the Dow
Jones  public-utility  average.  For  comparison,  Table  14-5  gives  a
similar picture of a random selection of fifteen other utilities taken
from the New York Stock Exchange list.

As  1972  began  the  defensive  investor  could  have  had  quite  a
wide choice of utility common stocks, each of which would have
met our requirements for both performance and price. These com-
panies  offered  him  everything  he  had  a  right  to  demand  from 
simply  chosen  common-stock  investments.  In  comparison  with
prominent industrial companies as represented by the DJIA, they
offered almost as good a record of past growth, plus smaller fluctu-
ations  in  the  annual  figures—both  at  a  lower  price  in  relation  to
earnings and assets. The dividend return was significantly higher.
The  position  of  the  utilities  as  regulated  monopolies  is  assuredly
more  of  an  advantage  than  a  disadvantage  for  the  conservative
investor.  Under  law  they  are  entitled  to  charge  rates  sufficiently
remunerative  to  attract  the  capital  they  need  for  their  continuous
expansion,  and  this  implies  adequate  offsets  to  inflated  costs.
While  the  process  of  regulation  has  often  been  cumbersome  and
perhaps  dilatory,  it  has  not  prevented  the  utilities  from  earning  a
fair return on their rising invested capital over many decades.

celed  and  decommissioned  nuclear  energy  plants;  nor  did  he  foresee  the
consequences  of  bungled  regulation  in  California.  Utility  stocks  are  vastly
more  volatile  than  they  were  in  Graham’s  day,  and  most  investors  should
own them only through a well-diversified, low-cost fund like the Dow Jones
U.S. Utilities Sector Index Fund (ticker symbol: IDU) or Utilities Select Sec-
tor  SPDR  (XLU).  For  more  information,  see:  www.ishares.com  and  www.
spdrindex.com/spdr/. (Be sure your broker will not charge commissions to
reinvest your dividends.)

Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

359

For the defensive investor the central appeal of the public-utility
stocks at this time should be their availability at a moderate price
in relation to book value. This means that he can ignore stockmar-
ket considerations, if he wishes, and consider himself primarily as
a part owner of well-established and well-earning businesses. The
market  quotations  are  always  there  for  him  to  take  advantage  of
when  times  are  propitious—either  for  purchases  at  unusually
attractive low levels, or for sales when their prices seem definitely
too high.

The  market  record  of  the  public-utility  indexes—condensed  in
Table 14-6, along with those of other groups—indicates that there
have been ample possibilities of profit in these investments in the
past. While the rise has not been as great as in the industrial index,
the  individual  utilities  have  shown  more  price  stability  in  most
periods  than  have  other  groups.*  It  is  striking  to  observe  in  this
table  that  the  relative  price/earnings  ratios  of  the  industrials  and
the  utilities  have  changed  places  during  the  past  two  decades.

* In  a  remarkable  confirmation  of  Graham’s  point,  the  dull-sounding  Stan-
dard & Poor’s Utility Index outperformed the vaunted NASDAQ Composite
Index for the 30 years ending December 31, 2002.

The Intelligent Investor

These reversals will have more meaning for the active than for the
passive  investor.  But  they  suggest  that  even  defensive  portfolios
should  be  changed  from  time  to  time,  especially  if  the  securities
purchased  have  an  apparently  excessive  advance  and  can  be
replaced by issues much more reasonably priced. Alas! there will
be capital-gains taxes to pay—which for the typical investor seems
to be about the same as the Devil to pay. Our old ally, experience,
tells us here that it is better to sell and pay the tax than not sell and
repent.

Investing in Stocks of Financial Enterprises

A considerable  variety  of  concerns  may  be  ranged  under  the
rubric  of  “financial  companies.”  These  would  include  banks, 
insurance  companies,  savings  and  loan  associations,  credit  and
small-loan  companies,  mortgage  companies,  and  “investment
companies”  (e.g.,  mutual  funds).*  It  is  characteristic  of  all  these
enterprises that they have a relatively small part of their assets in
the form of material things—such as fixed assets and merchandise
inventories—but  on  the  other  hand  most  categories  have  short-
term obligations well in excess of their stock capital. The question
of financial soundness is, therefore, more relevant here than in the
case  of  the  typical  manufacturing  or  commercial  enterprise.  This,
in turn, has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervi-
sion,  with  the  design  and  general  result  of  assuring  against
unsound financial practices.

Broadly  speaking,  the  shares  of  financial  concerns  have  pro-
duced investment results similar to those of other types of common
shares. Table 14-7 shows price changes between 1948 and 1970 in
six  groups  represented  in  the  Standard  &  Poor’s  stock-price
indexes.  The  average  for  1941–1943  is  taken  as  10,  the  base  level.

* Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more components,
including commercial banks; savings & loan and mortgage-financing compa-
nies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card issuers; money managers and
trust companies; investment banks and brokerages; insurance companies;
and firms engaged in developing or owning real estate, including real-estate
investment  trusts.  Although  the  sector  is  much  more  diversified  today,
Graham’s caveats about financial soundness apply more than ever.

a Year-end  figures  from  Standard  &  Poor’s  stock-price  indexes. Average  of  1941–
1943 = 10.

The year-end 1970 figures ranged between 44.3 for the 9 New York
banks  and  218  for  the  11  life-insurance  stocks.  During  the  sub-
intervals  there  was  considerable  variation  in  the  respective  price
movements. For example, the New York City bank stocks did quite
well  between  1958  and  1968;  conversely  the  spectacular  life-
insurance  group  actually  lost  ground  between  1963  and  1968.
These  cross-movements  are  found  in  many,  perhaps  most,  of  the
numerous industry groups in the Standard & Poor’s indexes.

We have no very helpful remarks to offer in this broad area of
investment—other than to counsel that the same arithmetical stan-
dards for price in relation to earnings and book value be applied to
the choice of companies in these groups as we have suggested for
industrial and public-utility investments.

Railroad Issues

The railroad story is a far different one from that of the utilities.
The  carriers  have  suffered  severely  from  a  combination  of  severe
competition and strict regulation. (Their labor-cost problem has of

course been difficult as well, but that has not been confined to rail-
roads.)  Automobiles,  buses,  and  airlines  have  drawn  off  most  of
their  passenger  business  and  left  the  rest  highly  unprofitable;  the
trucks have taken a good deal of their freight traffic. More than half
of the railroad mileage of the country has been in bankruptcy (or
“trusteeship”) at various times during the past 50 years.

But this half-century has not been all downhill for the carriers.
There have been prosperous periods for the industry, especially the
war years. Some of the lines have managed to maintain their earn-
ing power and their dividends despite the general difficulties.

The Standard & Poor’s index advanced sevenfold from the low
of 1942 to the high of 1968, not much below the percentage gain in
the public-utility index. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Trans-
portation  Co.,  our  most  important  railroad,  in  1970  shocked  the
financial  world.  Only  a  year  and  two  years  previously  the  stock
sold at close to the highest price level in its long history, and it had
paid  continuous  dividends  for  more  than  120  years!  (On  p.  423
below we present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a
competent student could have detected the developing weaknesses
in  the  company’s  picture  and  counseled  against  ownership  of  its
securities.) The market level of railroad shares as a whole was seri-
ously affected by this financial disaster.

It  is  usually  unsound  to  make  blanket  recommendations  of
whole classes of securities, and there are equal objections to broad
condemnations.  The  record  of  railroad  share  prices  in  Table  14-6
shows  that  the  group  as  a  whole  has  often  offered  chances  for  a
large  profit.  (But  in  our  view  the  great  advances  were  in  them-
selves largely unwarranted.) Let us confine our suggestion to this:
There  is  no  compelling  reason  for  the  investor  to  own  railroad
shares; before he buys any he should make sure that he is getting
so much value for his money that it would be unreasonable to look
for something else instead.*

* Only  a  few  major  rail  stocks  now  remain,  including  Burlington  Northern,
CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this section is at
least  as  relevant  to  airline  stocks  today—with  their  massive  current  losses
and a half-century of almost incessantly poor results—as it was to railroads
in Graham’s day.

Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

363

Selectivity for the Defensive Investor

Every investor would like his list to be better or more promising
than the average. Hence the reader will ask whether, if he gets him-
self a competent adviser or security analyst, he should not be able to
count on being supplied with an investment package of really supe-
rior merits. “After all,” he may say, “the rules you have outlined are
pretty simple and easygoing. A highly trained analyst ought to be
able to use all his skill and techniques to improve substantially on
something as obvious as the Dow Jones list. If not, what good are all
his statistics, calculations, and pontifical judgments?”

Suppose,  as  a  practical  test,  we  had  asked  a  hundred  security
analysts to choose the “best” five stocks in the Dow Jones Average,
to  be  bought  at  the  end  of  1970.  Few  would  have  come  up  with
identical  choices  and  many  of  the  lists  would  have  differed  com-
pletely from each other.

This is not so surprising as it may at first appear. The underlying
reason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well
reflects  the  salient  factors  in  its  financial  record  plus  the  general
opinion as to its future prospects. Hence the view of any analyst that
one stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent
from his personal partialities and expectations, or from the placing
of his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his
work of evaluation. If all analysts were agreed that one particular
stock was better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance
to a price which would offset all of its previous advantages.*

* Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH, an aca-
demic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly
available information about the company. With millions of investors scouring
the  market  every  day,  it  is  unlikely  that  severe  mispricings  can  persist  for
long.  An  old  joke  has  two  finance  professors  walking  along  the  sidewalk;
when one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his
arm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have
taken it already.” While the market is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close
most of the time—so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock
market’s $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the
costs of trading and taxes.

364

The Intelligent Investor

Our  statement  that  the  current  price  reflects  both  known  facts
and  future  expectations  was  intended  to  emphasize  the  double
basis  for  market  valuations.  Corresponding  with  these  two  kinds
of value elements are two basically different approaches to security
analysis. To be sure, every competent analyst looks forward to the
future  rather  than  backward  to  the  past,  and  he  realizes  that  his
work will prove good or bad depending on what will happen and
not  on  what  has happened.  Nevertheless,  the  future  itself  can  be
approached in two different ways, which may be called the way of
prediction (or projection) and the way of protection.*

Those  who  emphasize  prediction  will  endeavor  to  anticipate
fairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future
years—in particular whether earnings will show pronounced and
persistent growth. These conclusions may be based on a very care-
ful study of such factors as supply and demand in the industry—or
volume,  price,  and  costs—or  else  they  may  be  derived  from  a
rather naïve projection of the line of past growth into the future. If
these authorities are convinced that the fairly long-term prospects
are  unusually  favorable,  they  will  almost  always  recommend  the
stock for purchase without paying too much regard to the level at
which it is selling. Such, for example, was the general attitude with
respect  to  the  air-transport  stocks—an  attitude  that  persisted  for
many years despite the distressingly bad results often shown after
1946.  In  the  Introduction  we  have  commented  on  the  disparity
between  the  strong  price  action  and  the  relatively  disappointing
earnings record of this industry.

* This  is  one  of  the  central  points  of  Graham’s  book.  All  investors  labor
under a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for the future.
And, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain. Inflation and inter-
est rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;
geopolitical  upheavals  like  war,  commodity  shortages,  and  terrorism  arrive
without  warning;  and  the  fate  of  individual  companies  and  their  industries
often turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,
investing on the basis of projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of
the so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-
ple,  investing  on  the  basis  of  protection—from  overpaying  for  a  stock  and
from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best solu-
tion. Graham expands on this concept in Chapter 20.

Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

365

By  contrast,  those  who  emphasize  protection  are  always  espe-
cially  concerned  with  the  price  of  the  issue  at  the  time  of  study.
Their main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of
indicated  present  value  above  the  market  price—which  margin
could  absorb  unfavorable  developments  in  the  future.  Generally
speaking, therefore, it is not so necessary for them to be enthusias-
tic over the company’s long-run prospects as it is to be reasonably
confident that the enterprise will get along.

The first, or predictive, approach could also be called the quali-
tative  approach,  since  it  emphasizes  prospects,  management,  and
other  nonmeasurable,  albeit  highly  important,  factors  that  go
under the heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach
may  be  called  the  quantitative  or  statistical  approach,  since  it
emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and
earnings, assets, dividends, and so forth. Incidentally, the quantita-
tive  method  is  really  an  extension—into  the  field  of  common
stocks—of  the  viewpoint  that  security  analysis  has  found  to  be
sound  in  the  selection  of  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  for  invest-
ment.

In  our  own  attitude  and  professional  work  we  were  always
committed to the quantitative approach. From the first we wanted
to make sure that we were getting ample value for our money in
concrete,  demonstrable  terms.  We  were  not  willing  to  accept  the
prospects and promises of the future as compensation for a lack of
sufficient value in hand. This has by no means been the standard
viewpoint  among  investment  authorities;  in  fact,  the  majority
would  probably  subscribe  to  the  view  that  prospects,  quality  of
management,  other  intangibles,  and  “the  human  factor”  far  out-
weigh the indications supplied by any study of the past record, the
balance sheet, and all the other cold figures.

Thus  this  matter  of  choosing  the  “best”  stocks  is  at  bottom  a
highly  controversial  one.  Our  advice  to  the  defensive  investor  is
that  he  let  it  alone.  Let  him  emphasize  diversification  more  than
individual selection. Incidentally, the universally accepted idea of
diversification is, in part at least, the negation of the ambitious pre-
tensions of selectivity. If one could select the best stocks unerringly,
one  would  only  lose  by  diversifying.  Yet  within  the  limits  of  the
four  most  general  rules  of  common-stock  selection  suggested  for
the  defensive  investor  (on  pp.  114–115)  there  is  room  for  a  rather
considerable freedom of preference. At the worst the indulgence of

366

The Intelligent Investor

such  preferences  should  do  no  harm;  beyond  that,  it  may  add
something worthwhile to the results. With the increasing impact of
technological  developments  on  long-term  corporate  results,  the
investor  cannot  leave  them  out  of  his  calculations.  Here,  as  else-
where, he must seek a mean between neglect and overemphasis.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 14

How  should  you  tackle  the  nitty-gritty  work  of  stock  selection?  Gra-
ham suggests that the defensive investor can, “most simply,” buy every
stock in the DowJones Industrial Average. Today’s defensive investor
can  do  even  better—by  buying  a  total  stock-market  index  fund  that
holds  essentially  every  stock  worth  having.  A  low-cost  index  fund  is
the  best  tool  ever  created  for  low-maintenance  stock  investing—and
any effort to improve on it takes more work (and incurs more risk and
higher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify.

Researching  and  selecting  your  own  stocks  is  not  necessary;  for
most  people,  it  is  not  even  advisable.  However,  some  defensive
investors do enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking
individual  stocks—and,  if  you  have  survived  a  bear  market  and  still
enjoy stock picking, then nothing that Graham or I could say will dis-
suade you. In that case, instead of making a total stock market index
fund your complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio.
Once you have that foundation in place, you can experiment around
the  edges  with  your  own  stock  choices.  Keep  90%  of  your  stock
money  in  an  index  fund,  leaving  10%  with  which  to  try  picking  your
own  stocks.  Only  after  you  build  that  solid  core  should  you  explore.

Commentary on Chapter 14

W H Y   D I V E R S I F Y ?

During the bull market of the 1990s, one of the most common
criticisms of diversification was that it lowers your potential for
high  returns.  After  all,  if  you  could  identify  the  next  Microsoft,
wouldn’t it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one
basket?

Well,  sure.  As  the  humorist  Will  Rogers  once  said,  “Don’t
gamble.  Take  all  your  savings  and  buy  some  good  stock  and
hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”

However,  as  Rogers  knew,  20/20  foresight  is  not  a  gift
granted  to  most  investors.  No  matter  how  confident  we  feel,
there’s no way to find out whether a stock will go up until after
we  buy  it.  Therefore,  the  stock  you  think  is  “the  next  Micro-
soft”  may  well  turn  out  to  be  the  next  MicroStrategy  instead.
(That former market star went from $3,130 per share in March
2000  to  $15.10  at  year-end  2002,  an  apocalyptic  loss  of
99.5%).1 Keeping your money spread across many stocks and
industries is the only reliable insurance against the risk of being
wrong.

But  diversification  doesn’t  just  minimize  your  odds  of  being
wrong. It also maximizes your chances of being right. Over long
periods of time, a handful of stocks turn into “superstocks” that
go  up  10,000%  or  more.  Money Magazine  identified  the  30
best-performing stocks over the 30 years ending in 2002—and,
even  with  20/20  hindsight,  the  list  is  startlingly  unpredictable.
Rather than lots of technology or health-care stocks, it includes
Southwest Airlines, Worthington Steel, Dollar General discount
stores,  and  snuff-tobacco  maker  UST  Inc.2 If  you  think  you
would have been willing to bet big on any of those stocks back
in 1972, you are kidding yourself.

Think of it this way: In the huge market haystack, only a few
needles ever go on to generate truly gigantic gains. The more of
the haystack you own, the higher the odds go that you will end
up finding at least one of those needles. By owning the entire
haystack (ideally through an index fund that tracks the total U.S.
stock market) you can be sure to find every needle, thus captur-
ing  the  returns  of  all  the  superstocks.  Especially  if  you  are  a

Commentary on Chapter 14

369

defensive investor, why look for the needles when you can own
the whole haystack?

1 Adjusted for stock splits. To many people, MicroStrategy really did look like

the next Microsoft in early 2000; its stock had gained 566.7% in 1999, and its

chairman, Michael Saylor, declared that “our future today is better than it was

18 months ago.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later accused

MicroStrategy of accounting fraud, and Saylor paid an $8.3 million fine to set-

tle the charges.

Let’s briefly update Graham’s criteria for stock selection.

Adequate  size. Nowadays,  “to  exclude  small  companies,”  most
defensive investors should steer clear of stocks with a total market value
of less than $2 billion. In early 2003, that still left you with 437 of the
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to choose from.

However, today’s defensive investors—unlike those in Graham’s day—
can conveniently own small companies by buying a mutual fund special-
izing in small stocks. Again, an index fund like Vanguard Small-Cap Index
is the first choice, although active funds are available at reasonable cost
from such firms as Ariel, T. Rowe Price, Royce, and Third Avenue.

Strong financial condition. According to market strategists Steve
Galbraith and Jay Lasus of Morgan Stanley, at the beginning of 2003
about  120  of  the  companies  in  the  S  &  P  500  index  met  Graham’s
test of a 2-to-1 current ratio. With current assets at least twice their
current liabilities, these firms had a sizeable cushion of working capital
that—on average—should sustain them through hard times.

Wall Street has always abounded in bitter ironies, and the bursting
of the growth-stock bubble has created a doozy: In 1999 and 2000,
high-tech, bio-tech, and telecommunications stocks were supposed to
provide  “aggressive  growth”  and  ended  up  giving  most  of  their
investors aggressive shrinkage instead. But, by early 2003, the wheel
had come full circle, and many of those aggressive growth stocks had
become  financially  conservative—loaded  with  working  capital,  rich  in
cash, and often debt-free. This table provides a sampler:

In 1999, most of these companies were among the hottest of the market’s dar-
lings, offering the promise of high potential growth. By early 2003, they offered
hard evidence of true value.

Commentary on Chapter 14

The lesson here is not that these stocks were “a sure thing,” or that
you  should  rush  out  and  buy  everything  (or  anything)  in  this  table.1
Instead, you should realize that a defensive investor can always pros-
per  by  looking  patiently  and  calmly  through  the  wreckage  of  a  bear
market. Graham’s criterion of financial strength still works: If you build
a diversified basket of stocks whose current assets are at least double
their  current  liabilities,  and  whose  long-term  debt  does  not  exceed
working  capital,  you  should  end  up  with  a  group  of  conservatively
financed  companies  with  plenty  of  staying  power.  The  best  values
today are often found in the stocks that were once hot and have since
gone  cold.  Throughout  history,  such  stocks  have  often  provided  the
margin of safety that a defensive investor demands.

Earnings  stability. According  to  Morgan  Stanley,  86%  of  all  the
companies in the S & P 500 index have had positive earnings in every
year  from  1993  through  2002.  So  Graham’s  insistence  on  “some
earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years” remains
a  valid  test—tough  enough  to  eliminate  chronic  losers,  but  not  so
restrictive as to limit your choices to an unrealistically small sample.

Dividend  record. As  of  early  2003,  according  to  Standard  &
Poor’s, 354 companies in the S & P 500 (or 71% of the total) paid a
dividend.  No  fewer  than  255  companies  have  paid  a  dividend  for  at
least 20 years in a row. And, according to S & P, 57 companies in the
index  have  raised their  dividends  for  at  least  25  consecutive  years.
That’s  no  guarantee  that  they  will  do  so  forever,  but  it’s  a  comfort-
ing sign.

Earnings  growth. How  many  companies  in  the  S  &  P  500
increased their earnings per share by “at least one third,” as Graham
requires,  over  the  10  years  ending  in  2002?  (We’ll  average  each
company’s  earnings  from  1991  through  1993,  and  then  determine
whether the average earnings from 2000 through 2002 were at least
33%  higher.)  According  to  Morgan  Stanley,  264  companies  in  the 
S & P 500 met that test. But here, it seems, Graham set a very low
hurdle; 33% cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3% aver-
age  annual  increase.  Cumulative  growth  in  earnings  per  share  of  at
least 50%—or a 4% average annual rise—is a bit less conservative. No

2002.

fewer than 245 companies in the S & P 500 index met that criterion as
of early 2003, leaving the defensive investor an ample list to choose
from.  (If  you  double  the  cumulative  growth  hurdle  to  100%,  or  7%
average annual growth, then 198 companies make the cutoff.)

Moderate  P/E  ratio. Graham  recommends  limiting  yourself  to
stocks whose current price is no more than 15 times average earnings
over  the  past  three  years.  Incredibly,  the  prevailing  practice  on  Wall
Street today is to value stocks by dividing their current price by some-
thing  called  “next  year’s  earnings.”  That  gives  what  is  sometimes
called  “the  forward  P/E  ratio.”  But  it’s  nonsensical  to  derive  a
price/earnings ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown
future earnings. Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has
shown, 59% of Wall Street’s “consensus” earnings forecasts miss the
mark by a mortifyingly wide margin—either underestimating or overesti-
mating the actual reported earnings by at least 15%.2 Investing your
money on the basis of what these myopic soothsayers predict for the
coming year is as risky as volunteering to hold up the bulls-eye at an
archery  tournament  for  the  legally  blind.  Instead,  calculate  a  stock’s
price/earnings ratio yourself, using Graham’s formula of current price
divided by average earnings over the past three years.3

As of early 2003, how many stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500
index were valued at no more than 15 times their average earnings of
2000 through 2002? According to Morgan Stanley, a generous total
of 185 companies passed Graham’s test.

Moderate  price-to-book  ratio. Graham  recommends  a  “ratio  of
price to assets” (or price-to-book-value ratio) of no more than 1.5. In
recent years, an increasing proportion of the value of companies has
come from intangible assets like franchises, brand names, and patents
and trademarks. Since these factors (along with goodwill from acqui-
sitions) are excluded from the standard definition of book value, most
companies today are priced at higher price-to-book multiples than in
Graham’s day. According to Morgan Stanley, 123 of the companies in
the S & P 500 (or one in four) are priced below 1.5 times book value.

of Psychology and Financial Markets, vol. 3, no. 1 (2002), pp. 4–14.

obtain  the  data  at  websites  like  www.morningstar.com  or  http://finance.
yahoo.com.

All  told,  273  companies  (or  55%  of  the  index)  have  price-to-book
ratios of less than 2.5.

What about Graham’s suggestion that you multiply the P/E ratio by
the price-to-book ratio and see whether the resulting number is below
22.5? Based on data from Morgan Stanley, at least 142 stocks in the
S  &  P  500  could  pass  that  test  as  of  early  2003,  including  Dana
Corp., Electronic Data Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Washington
Mutual.  So  Graham’s  “blended  multiplier”  still  works  as  an  initial
screen to identify reasonably-priced stocks.

D U E   D I L I G E N C E

No  matter  how  defensive  an  investor  you  are—in  Graham’s  sense  of
wishing to minimize the work you put into picking stocks—there are a
couple of steps you cannot afford to skip:

Do your homework. Through the EDGAR database at www.sec.
gov,  you  get  instant  access  to  a  company’s  annual  and  quarterly
reports, along with the proxy statement that discloses the managers’
compensation, ownership, and potential conflicts of interest. Read at
least five years’ worth.4

Check  out  the  neighborhood. Websites  like  http://quicktake.
morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com and www.quicken.com can
readily tell you what percentage of a company’s shares are owned by
institutions.  Anything  over  60%  suggests  that  a  stock  is  scarcely
undiscovered  and  probably  “overowned.”  (When  big  institutions  sell,
they  tend  to  move  in  lockstep,  with  disastrous  results  for  the  stock.
Imagine all the Radio City Rockettes toppling off the front edge of the
stage at once and you get the idea.) Those websites will also tell you
who  the  largest  owners  of  the  stock  are.  If  they  are  money-
management  firms  that  invest  in  a  style  similar  to  your  own,  that’s  a
good sign.

4 For more on what to look for, see the commentary on Chapters 11, 12, and
19. If you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of reading the proxy and
making  basic  comparisons  of  financial  health  across  five  years’  worth  of
annual reports, then you are too defensive to be buying individual stocks at
all.  Get  yourself  out  of  the  stock-picking  business  and  into  an  index  fund,
where you belong.

CHAPTER 15

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

In the previous chapter we have dealt with common-stock selec-
tion in terms of broad groups of eligible securities, from which the
defensive investor is free to make up any list that he or his adviser
prefers, provided adequate diversification is achieved. Our empha-
sis in selection has been chiefly on exclusions—advising on the one
hand  against  all  issues  of  recognizably  poor  quality,  and  on  the
other against the highest-quality issues if their price is so high as to
involve a considerable speculative risk. In this chapter, addressed
to the enterprising investor, we must consider the possibilities and
the means of making individual selections which are likely to prove
more profitable than an across-the-board average.

What are the prospects of doing this successfully? We would be
less than frank, as the euphemism goes, if we did not at the outset
express  some  grave  reservations  on  this  score.  At  first  blush  the
case  for  successful  selection  appears  self-evident.  To  get  average
results—e.g.,  equivalent  to  the  performance  of  the  DJIA—should
require no special ability of any kind. All that is needed is a portfo-
lio  identical  with,  or  similar  to,  those  thirty  prominent  issues.
Surely,  then,  by  the  exercise  of  even  a  moderate  degree  of  skill—
derived  from  study,  experience,  and  native  ability—it  should  be
possible to obtain substantially better results than the DJIA.

Yet  there  is  considerable  and  impressive  evidence  to  the  effect
that this is very hard to do, even though the qualifications of those
trying  it  are  of  the  highest.  The  evidence  lies  in  the  record  of  the
numerous investment companies, or “funds,” which have been in
operation for many years. Most of these funds are large enough to
command the services of the best financial or security analysts in
the  field,  together  with  all  the  other  constituents  of  an  adequate
research  department.  Their  expenses  of  operation,  when  spread

376

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

377

over  their  ample  capital,  average  about  one-half  of  1%  a  year
thereon,  or  less.  These  costs  are  not  negligible  in  themselves;  but
when they are compared with the approximately 15% annual over-
all  return  on  common  stocks  generally  in  the  decade  1951–1960,
and  even  the  6%  return  in  1961–1970,  they  do  not  bulk  large.  A
small amount of superior selective ability should easily have over-
come  that  expense  handicap  and  brought  in  a  superior  net  result
for the fund shareholders.

Taken  as  a  whole,  however,  the  all-common-stock  funds  failed
over  a  long  span  of  years  to  earn  quite  as  good  a  return  as  was
shown on Standard & Poor’s 500-stock averages or the market as a
whole. This conclusion has been substantiated by several compre-
hensive  studies.  To  quote  the  latest  one  before  us,  covering  the
period 1960–1968:*

It  appears  from  these  results  that  random  portfolios  of  New
York  Stock  Exchange  stocks  with  equal  investment  in  each  stock
performed on the average better over the period than did mutual
funds in the same risk class. The differences were fairly substantial
for  the  low-  and  medium-risk  portfolios  (3.7%  and  2.5%  respec-
tively  per  annum),  but  quite  small  for  the  high-risk  portfolios
(0.2% per annum).1

As we pointed out in Chapter 9, these comparative figures in no
way invalidate the usefulness of the investment funds as a finan-
cial  institution.  For  they  do  make  available  to  all  members  of  the

* The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through June
1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual funds
against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more than 500
of  the  largest  stocks  listed  on  the  NYSE.  The  funds  in  the  Friend-Blume-
Crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had in the first half
of  the  measurement  period,  much  as  Graham  found  in  his  own  research
(see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did not last. And
the thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average, underperform the
market  by  a  margin  roughly  equal  to  their  operating  expenses  and  trading
costs—has been reconfirmed so many times that anyone who doubts them
should found a financial chapter of The Flat Earth Society.

investing public the possibility of obtaining approximately average
results on their common-stock commitments. For a variety of rea-
sons, most members of the public who put their money in common
stocks of their own choice fail to do nearly as well. But to the objec-
tive  observer  the  failure  of  the  funds  to  better  the  performance 
of  a  broad  average  is  a  pretty  conclusive  indication  that  such  an
achievement, instead of being easy, is in fact extremely difficult.

Why should this be so? We can think of two different explana-
tions,  each  of  which  may  be  partially  applicable.  The  first  is  the
possibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current
prices  not  only  all  the  important  facts  about  the  companies’  past
and  current  performance,  but  also  whatever  expectations  can  be
reasonably formed as to their future. If this is so, then the diverse
market movements which subsequently take place—and these are
often extreme—must be the result of new developments and prob-
abilities that could not be reliably foreseen. This would make the
price movements essentially fortuitous and random. To the extent
that the foregoing is true, the work of the security analyst—how-
ever intelligent and thorough—must be largely ineffective, because
in essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable.

The very multiplication of the number of security analysts may
have played an important part in bringing about this result. With
hundreds,  even  thousands,  of  experts  studying  the  value  factors
behind an important common stock, it would be natural to expect
that  its  current  price  would  reflect  pretty  well  the  consensus  of
informed opinion on its value. Those who would prefer it to other
issues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism
that could just as well be wrong as right.

We have often thought of the analogy between the work of the
host  of  security  analysts  on  Wall  Street  and  the  performance  of
master  bridge  players  at  a  duplicate-bridge  tournament.  The  for-
mer try to pick the stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get
top score for each hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish
either aim. To the extent that all the bridge players have about the
same level of expertness, the winners are likely to be determined
by  “breaks”  of  various  sorts  rather  than  superior  skill.  On  Wall
Street the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that
exists  in  the  profession,  under  which  ideas  and  discoveries  are
quite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of various sorts.

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

379

It is almost as if, at the analogous bridge tournament, the various
experts were looking over each other’s shoulders and arguing out
each hand as it was played.

The second possibility is of a quite different sort. Perhaps many
of  the  security  analysts  are  handicapped  by  a  flaw  in  their  basic
approach  to  the  problem  of  stock  selection.  They  seek  the  indus-
tries with the best prospects of growth, and the companies in these
industries  with  the  best  management  and  other  advantages.  The
implication is that they will buy into such industries and such com-
panies at any price, however high, and they will avoid less promis-
ing industries and companies no matter how low the price of their
shares. This would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of
the good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely
in the future, for then in theory their value would be infinite. And
if  the  less  promising  companies  were  headed  for  extinction,  with
no salvage, the analysts would be right to consider them unattrac-
tive at any price.

The  truth  about  our  corporate  ventures  is  quite  otherwise.
Extremely  few  companies  have  been  able  to  show  a  high  rate  of
uninterrupted  growth  for  long  periods  of  time.  Remarkably  few,
also, of the larger companies suffer ultimate extinction. For most,
their history is one of vicissitudes, of ups and downs, of change in
their relative standing. In some the variations “from rags to riches
and  back”  have  been  repeated  on  almost  a  cyclical  basis—the
phrase used to be a standard one applied to the steel industry—for
others spectacular changes have been identified with deterioration
or improvement of management.*

How  does  the  foregoing  inquiry  apply  to  the  enterprising
investor  who  would  like  to  make  individual  selections  that  will
yield superior results? It suggests first of all that he is taking on a

* As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several other
reasons  mutual  funds  have  not  been  able  to  outperform  the  market  aver-
ages,  including  the  low  returns  on  the  funds’  cash  balances  and  the  high
costs of researching and trading stocks. Also, a fund holding 120 compa-
nies (a typical number) can trail the S & P 500-stock index if any of the other
380 companies  in  that  benchmark  turns  out  to  be  a  great  performer.  The
fewer stocks a fund owns, the more likely it is to miss “the next Microsoft.”

difficult  and  perhaps  impracticable  assignment.  Readers  of  this
book,  however  intelligent  and  knowing,  could  scarcely  expect  to
do  a  better  job  of  portfolio  selection  than  the  top  analysts  of  the
country. But if it is true that a fairly large segment of the stock mar-
ket is often discriminated against or entirely neglected in the stan-
dard analytical selections, then the intelligent investor may be in a
position to profit from the resultant undervaluations.

But to do so he must follow specific methods that are not gener-
ally accepted on Wall Street, since those that are so accepted do not
seem  to  produce  the  results  everyone  would  like  to  achieve.  It
would be rather strange if—with all the brains at work profession-
ally in the stock market—there could be approaches which are both
sound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation
have been based on this unlikely fact.*

A Summary of the Graham-Newman Methods

To give  concreteness  to  the  last  statement,  it  should  be  worth-
while to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged
in  during  the  thirty-year  life  of  Graham-Newman  Corporation,
between  1926  and  1956.†  These  were  classified  in  our  records  as
follows:

Arbitrages: The purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale

* In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is summarizing the
Efficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the contrary, the prob-
lem  with  the  stock  market  today  is  not  that  so  many  financial  analysts  are
idiots,  but  rather  that  so  many  of  them  are  so  smart.  As  more  and  more
smart  people  search  the  market  for  bargains,  that  very  act  of  searching
makes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel paradox, makes the analysts look
as if they lack the intelligence to justify the search. The market’s valuation of
a given stock is the result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of col-
lective intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective intelli-
gence  gets  the  valuation  approximately  right.  Only  rarely  does  Graham’s
“Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of whack.
† Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved
it when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the suc-
cessor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account, which
he ran from January 1926, through December 1935.

of one or more other securities into which it was to be exchanged
under a plan of reorganization, merger, or the like.

Liquidations: Purchase  of  shares  which  were  to  receive  one  or

more cash payments in liquidation of the company’s assets.

Operations of these two classes were selected on the twin basis
of (a) a calculated annual return of 20% or more, and (b) our judg-
ment that the chance of a successful outcome was at least four out
of five.

Related Hedges: The purchase of convertible bonds or convertible
preferred  shares,  and  the  simultaneous  sale  of  the  common  stock
into which they were exchangeable. The position was established
at close to a parity basis—i.e., at a small maximum loss if the senior
issue had actually to be converted and the operation closed out in
that way. But a profit would be made if the common stock fell con-
siderably more than the senior issue, and the position closed out in
the market.

Net-Current-Asset  (or  “Bargain”)  Issues: The  idea  here  was  to
acquire  as  many  issues  as  possible  at  a  cost  for  each  of  less  than
their  book  value  in  terms  of  net-current-assets  alone—i.e.,  giving
no value to the plant account and other assets. Our purchases were
made  typically  at  two-thirds  or  less  of  such  stripped-down  asset
value.  In  most  years  we  carried  a  wide  diversification  here—at
least 100 different issues.

We should add that from time to time we had some large-scale
acquisitions  of  the  control  type,  but  these  are  not  relevant  to  the
present discussion.

We kept close track of the results shown by each class of opera-
tion.  In  consequence  of  these  follow-ups  we  discontinued  two
broader  fields,  which  were  found  not  to  have  shown  satisfactory
overall results. The first was the purchase of apparently attractive
issues—based on our general analysis—which were not obtainable
at  less  than  their  working-capital  value  alone.  The  second  were
“unrelated”  hedging  operations,  in  which  the  purchased  security
was  not  exchangeable  for  the  common  shares  sold.  (Such  opera-
tions  correspond  roughly  to  those  recently  embarked  on  by  the
new group of “hedge funds” in the investment-company field.* In

* An “unrelated” hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by one com-
pany and short-selling (or betting on a decline in) a security issued by a dif-

The Intelligent Investor

both cases a study of the results realized by us over a period of ten
years  or  more  led  us  to  conclude  that  the  profits  were  not  suffi-
ciently dependable—and the operations not sufficiently “headache
proof”—to justify our continuing them.

Hence  from  1939  on  our  operations  were  limited  to  “self-
liquidating”  situations,  related  hedges,  working-capital  bargains,
and  a  few  control  operations.  Each  of  these  classes  gave  us  quite
consistently satisfactory results from then on, with the special fea-
ture that the related hedges turned in good profits in the bear mar-
kets when our “undervalued issues” were not doing so well.

We hesitate  to  prescribe  our  own  diet  for  any  large  number  of
intelligent  investors.  Obviously,  the  professional  techniques  we
have followed are not suitable for the defensive investor, who by
definition  is  an  amateur.  As  for  the  aggressive  investor,  perhaps
only a small minority of them would have the type of temperament
needed  to  limit  themselves  so  severely  to  only  a  relatively  small
part  of  the  world  of  securities.  Most  active-minded  practitioners
would prefer to venture into wider channels. Their natural hunting
grounds  would  be  the  entire  field  of  securities  that  they  felt  (a)
were  certainly  not  overvalued  by  conservative  measures,  and  (b)
appeared decidedly more attractive—because of their prospects or
past  record,  or  both—than  the  average  common  stock.  In  such
choices  they  would  do  well  to  apply  various  tests  of  quality  and
price-reasonableness  along  the  lines  we  have  proposed  for  the
defensive investor. But they should be less inflexible, permitting a
considerable  plus  in  one  factor  to  offset  a  small  black  mark  in
another. For example, he might not rule out a company which had
shown a deficit in a year such as 1970, if large average earnings and
other  important  attributes  made  the  stock  look  cheap.  The  enter-
prising  investor  may  confine  his  choice  to  industries  and  compa-
nies  about  which  he  holds  an  optimistic  view,  but  we  counsel
strongly against paying a high price for a stock (in relation to earn-

ferent  company.  A  “related”  hedge  involves  buying  and  selling  different
stocks or bonds issued by the same company. The “new group” of hedge
funds  described  by  Graham  were  widely  available  around  1968,  but  later
regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission restricted ac-
cess to hedge funds for the general public.

ings  and  assets)  because  of  such  enthusiasm.  If  he  followed  our
philosophy  in  this  field  he  would  more  likely  be  the  buyer  of
important  cyclical  enterprises—such  as  steel  shares  perhaps—
when the current situation is unfavorable, the near-term prospects
are poor, and the low price fully reflects the current pessimism.*

Secondary Companies

Next in order for examination and possible selection would come
secondary companies that are making a good showing, have a satis-
factory  past  record,  but  appear  to  hold  no  charm  for  the  public.
These  would  be  enterprises  on  the  order  of  eltra and  Emhart  at
their 1970 closing prices. (See Chapter 13 above.) There are various
ways of going about locating such companies. We should like to try
a novel approach here and give a reasonably detailed exposition of
one such exercise in stock selection. Ours is a double purpose. Many
of our readers may find a substantial practical value in the method
we shall follow, or it may suggest comparable methods to try out.
Beyond that what we shall do may help them to come to grips with
the real world of common stocks, and introduce them to one of the
most fascinating and valuable little volumes in existence. It is Stan-
dard & Poor’s Stock Guide, published monthly, and made available
to the general public under annual subscription. In addition many
brokerage firms distribute the Guide to their clients (on request.)

The great bulk of the Guide is given over to about 230 pages of
condensed statistical information on the stocks of more than 4,500
companies.  These  include  all  the  issues  listed  on  the  various
exchanges, say 3,000, plus some 1,500 unlisted issues. Most of the
items needed for a first and even a second look at a given company
appear  in  this  compendium.  (From  our  viewpoint  the  important
missing  datum  is  the  net-asset-value,  or  book  value,  per  share,
which can be found in the larger Standard & Poor’s volumes and
elsewhere.)

* In 2003, an intelligent investor following Graham’s train of thought would
be searching for opportunities in the technology, telecommunications, and
electric-utility industries. History has shown that yesterday’s losers are often
tomorrow’s winners.

384

The Intelligent Investor

The  investor  who  likes  to  play  around  with  corporate  figures
will find himself in clover with the Stock Guide. He can open to any
page and see before his eyes a condensed panorama of the splen-
dors and miseries of the stock market, with all-time high and low
prices going as far back as 1936, when available. He will find com-
panies that have multiplied their price 2,000 times from the minus-
cule low to the majestic high. (For prestigious IBM the growth was
“only” 333 times in that period.) He will find (not so exceptionally)
a company whose shares advanced from 3⁄8 to 68, and then fell back
to 3.2 In the dividend record column he will find one that goes back
to 1791—paid by Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island (which
recently saw fit to change its ancient corporate name).* If he looks
at  the  Guide for  the  year-end  1969  he  will  read  that  Penn  Central
Co. (as successor to Pennsylvania Railroad) has been paying divi-
dends  steadily  since  1848;  alas!,  it  was  doomed  to  bankruptcy  a
few months later. He will find a company selling at only 2 times its
last  reported  earnings,  and  another  selling  at  99  times  such  earn-
ings.3 In most cases he will find it difficult to tell the line of business
from  the  corporate  name;  for  one  U.S.  Steel  there  will  be  three
called such things as ITI Corp. (bakery stuff) or Santa Fe Industries
(mainly the large railroad). He can feast on an extraordinary vari-
ety  of  price  histories,  dividend  and  earnings  histories,  financial
positions,  capitalization  setups,  and  what  not.  Backward-leaning
conservatism,  run-of-the-mine  featureless  companies,  the  most
peculiar  combinations  of  “principal  business,”  all  kinds  of  Wall
Street  gadgets  and  widgets—they  are  all  there,  waiting  to  be
browsed over, or studied with a serious objective.

The Guides give in separate columns the current dividend yields
and price/earnings ratios, based on latest 12-month figures, wher-
ever applicable. It is this last item that puts us on the track of our
exercise in common-stock selection.

* The successor corporation to Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island is
FleetBoston Financial Corp. One of its corporate ancestors, the Providence
Bank, was founded in 1791.

A Winnowing of the Stock Guide

Suppose we look for a simple prima facie indication that a stock
is  cheap.  The  first  such  clue  that  comes  to  mind  is  a  low  price  in
relation to recent earnings. Let’s make a preliminary list of stocks
that sold at a multiple of nine or less at the end of 1970. That datum
is conveniently provided in the last column of the even-numbered
pages. For an illustrative sample we shall take the first 20 such low-
multiplier stocks; they begin with the sixth issue listed, Aberdeen
Mfg. Co., which closed the year at 101⁄4, or 9 times its reported earn-
ings  of  $1.25  per  share  for  the  12  months  ended  September  1970.
The  twentieth  such  issue  is  American  Maize  Products,  which
closed at 91⁄2, also with a multiplier of 9.

The  group  may  have  seemed  mediocre,  with  10  issues  selling
below  $10  per  share.  (This  fact  is  not  truly  important;  it  would
probably—not necessarily—warn defensive investors against such
a  list,  but  the  inference  for  enterprising  investors  might  be  favor-
able on balance.)* Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate
some numbers. Our list represents about one in ten of the first 200
issues  looked  at.  On  that  basis  the  Guide should  yield,  say,  450
issues  selling  at  multipliers  under  10.  This  would  make  a  goodly
number of candidates for further selectivity.

So let us apply to our list some additional criteria, rather similar
to those we suggested for the defensive investor, but not so severe.
We suggest the following:

1. Financial condition: (a) Current assets at least 11⁄2 times current
liabilities, and (b) debt not more than 110% of net current assets
(for industrial companies).

* For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around $1 per share—the
level below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared ineligible for trad-
ing on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock prices of these companies
can take a considerable amount of effort, making them impractical for defen-
sive  investors.  The  costs  of  trading  low-priced  stocks  can  be  very  high.
Finally, companies with very low stock prices have a distressing tendency to
go out of business. However, a diversified portfolio of dozens of these dis-
tressed companies may still appeal to some enterprising investors today.

2. Earnings  stability:  No  deficit  in  the  last  five  years  covered  in

the Stock Guide.

3. Dividend record: Some current dividend.
4. Earnings growth: Last year’s earnings more than those of 1966.
5. Price: Less than 120% net tangible assets.

The earnings figures in the Guide were generally for those end-
ing September 30, 1970, and thus do not include what may be a bad
quarter at the end of that year. But an intelligent investor can’t ask
for  the  moon—at  least  not  to  start  with.  Note  also  that  we  set  no
lower  limit  on  the  size  of  the  enterprise.  Small  companies  may
afford enough safety if bought carefully and on a group basis.

When we have applied the five additional criteria our list of 20
candidates is reduced to only five. Let us continue our search until
the first 450 issues in the Guide have yielded us a little “portfolio”
of  15  stocks  meeting  our  six  requirements.  (They  are  set  forth  in
Table  15–1,  together  with  some  relevant  data.)  The  group,  of
course, is presented for illustration only, and would not necessarily
have been chosen by our inquiring investor.

The fact is that the user of our method would have had a much
wider choice. If our winnowing approach had been applied to all
4,500  companies  in  the  Stock  Guide, and  if  the  ratio  for  the  first
tenth had held good throughout, we would end up with about 150
companies meeting all six of our criteria of selection. The enterpris-
ing  investor  would  then  be  able  to  follow  his  judgment—or  his
partialities and prejudices—in making a third selection of, say, one
out of five in this ample list.

The Stock  Guide material  includes  “Earnings  and  Dividend
Rankings,”  which  are  based  on  stability  and  growth  of  these  fac-
tors  for  the  past  eight  years.  (Thus  price attractiveness  does  not
enter here.) We include the S & P rankings in our Table 15-1. Ten of
the 15 issues are ranked B+ (= average) and one (American Maize)
is given the “high” rating of A. If our enterprising investor wanted
to add a seventh mechanical criterion to his choice, by considering
only  issues  ranked  by  Standard  &  Poor’s  as  average  or  better  in
quality, he might still have about 100 such issues to choose from.
One  might  say  that  a  group  of  issues,  of  at  least  average  quality,
meeting criteria of financial condition as well, purchasable at a low
multiplier of current earnings and below asset value, should offer
good promise of satisfactory investment results.

Single Criteria for Choosing Common Stocks

An inquiring reader might well ask whether the choice of a bet-
ter than average portfolio could be made a simpler affair than we
have  just  outlined.  Could  a  single  plausible  criterion  be  used  to
good advantage—such as a low price/earnings ratio, or a high div-
idend return, or a large asset value? The two methods of this sort
that  we  have  found  to  give  quite  consistently  good  results  in  the
longer past have been (a) the purchase of low-multiplier stocks of
important companies (such as the DJIA list), and (b) the choice of a
diversified  group  of  stocks  selling  under  their  net-current-asset

388

The Intelligent Investor

value (or working-capital value). We have already pointed out that
the low-multiplier criterion applied to the DJIA at the end of 1968
worked out badly when the results are measured to mid-1971. The
record  of  common-stock  purchases  made  at  a  price  below  their
working-capital value has no such bad mark against it; the draw-
back  here  has  been  the  drying  up  of  such  opportunities  during
most of the past decade.

What about other bases of choice? In writing this book we have
made a series of “experiments,” each based on a single, fairly obvi-
ous  criterion.  The  data  used  would  be  readily  found  in  the  Stan-
dard  &  Poor’s  Stock  Guide. In  all  cases  a  30-stock  portfolio  was
assumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then
revalued  at  June  30,  1971.  The  separate  criteria  applied  were  the
following, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) A low multi-
plier  of  recent  earnings  (not  confined  to  DJIA issues).  (2)  A high
dividend return. (3) A very long dividend record. (4) A very large
enterprise,  as  measured  by  number  of  outstanding  shares.  (5)  A
strong financial position. (6) A low price in dollars per share. (7) A
low price in relation to the previous high price. (8) A high quality-
ranking by Standard & Poor’s.

It will be noted that the Stock Guide has at least one column relat-
ing  to  each  of  the  above  criteria.  This  indicates  the  publisher’s
belief  that  each  is  of  importance  in  analyzing  and  choosing  com-
mon  stocks.  (As  we  pointed  out  above,  we  should  like  to  see
another figure added: the net-asset-value per share.)

The  most  important  fact  that  emerges  from  our  various  tests
relates  to  the  performance  of  stocks  bought  at  random.  We  have
tested this performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up
of  issues  found  on  the  first  line  of  the  December  31,  1968,  Stock
Guide and  also  found  in  the  issue  for  August  31,  1971.  Between
these  two  dates  the  S  &  P composite  was  practically  unchanged,
and  the  DJIA lost  about  5%.  But  our  90  randomly  chosen  issues
declined  an  average  of  22%,  not  counting  19  issues  that  were
dropped from the Guide and probably showed larger losses. These
comparative  results  undoubtedly  reflect  the  tendency  of  smaller
issues  of  inferior  quality  to  be  relatively  overvalued  in  bull  mar-
kets, and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger
issues  in  the  ensuing  price  collapse,  but  also  to  delay  their  full
recovery—in many cases indefinitely. The moral for the intelligent

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

389

investor is, of course, to avoid second-quality issues in making up
a portfolio, unless—for the enterprising investor—they are demon-
strable bargains.

Other  results  gleaned  from  our  portfolio  studies  may  be  sum-

marized as follows:

Only  three  of  the  groups  studied  showed  up  better  than  the 
S & P composite (and hence better than the DJIA), viz: (1) Industri-
als with the highest quality ranking (A+). These advanced 91⁄2% in
the period against a decline of 2.4% for the S & P industrials, and
5.6% for the DJIA. (However, the ten public-utility issues rated A+
declined 18% against a decline of 14% for the 55-stock S & P public-
utility index.) It is worth remarking that the S & P rankings showed
up very well in this single test. In every case a portfolio based on a
higher ranking did better than a lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Com-
panies  with  more  than  50  million  shares  outstanding  showed  no
change on the whole, as against a small decline for the indexes. (3)
Strangely enough, stocks selling at a high price per share (over 100)
showed a slight (1%) composite advance.

Among our various tests we made one based on book value, a
figure not given in the Stock Guide. Here we found—contrary to our
investment philosophy—that companies that combined major size
with  a  large  good-will  component  in  their  market  price  did  very
well as a whole in the 21⁄2-year holding period. (By “good-will com-
ponent”  we  mean  the  part  of  the  price  that  exceeds  the  book
value.)*  Our  list  of  “good-will  giants”  was  made  up  of  30  issues,
each of which had a good-will component of over a billion dollars,
representing  more  than  half  of  its  market  price.  The  total  market
value  of  these  good-will  items  at  the  end  of  1968  was  more  than
$120 billions! Despite these optimistic market valuations the group
as  a  whole  showed  a  price  advance  per  share  of  15%  between
December 1968 and August 1971, and acquitted itself best among
the 20-odd lists studied.

A fact  like  this  must  not  be  ignored  in  a  work  on  investment

* In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two causes:
a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more than the
value of their assets, or its own stock can trade for substantially more than
its book value.

390

The Intelligent Investor

policies.  It  is  clear  that,  at  the  least,  a  considerable  momentum is
attached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size,
an  excellent  past  record  of  earnings,  the  public’s  expectation  of
continued earnings growth in the future, and strong market action
over  many  past  years.  Even  if  the  price  may  appear  excessive  by
our quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may
well  carry  such  issues  along  more  or  less  indefinitely.  (Naturally
this assumption does not apply to every individual issue in the cat-
egory. For example, the indisputable good-will leader, IBM, moved
down  from  315  to  304  in  the  30-month  period.)  It  is  difficult  to
judge  to  what  extent  the  superior  market  action  shown  is  due  to
“true” or objective investment merits and to what extent to long-
established popularity. No doubt both factors are important here.
Clearly,  both  the  long-term  and  the  recent  market  action  of  the
good-will giants would recommend them for a diversified portfo-
lio  of  common  stocks.  Our  own  preference,  however,  remains  for
other types that show a combination of favorable investment fac-
tors, including asset values of at least two-thirds the market price.
The  tests  using  other  criteria  indicate  in  general  that  random
lists based on a single favorable factor did better than random lists
chosen  for  the  opposite  factor—e.g.,  low-multiplier  issues  had  a
smaller  decline  in  this  period  than  high-multiplier  issues,  and
long-term dividend payers lost less than those that were not pay-
ing dividends at the end of 1968. To that extent the results support
our recommendation that the issues selected meet a combination of
quantitative or tangible criteria.

Finally we should comment on the much poorer showing made
by  our  lists  as  a  whole  as  compared  with  the  price  record  of  the 
S & P composite. The latter is weighted by the size of each enter-
prise, whereas our tests are based on taking one share of each com-
pany. Evidently the larger emphasis given to giant enterprises by
the S & P method made a significant difference in the results, and
points up once again their greater price stability as compared with
“run-of-the-mine” companies.

Bargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks

In the tests discussed above we did not include the results of buy-
ing 30 issues at a price less than their net-current-asset value. The rea-
son was that only a handful, at most, of such issues would have been

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

391

found in the Stock Guide at the end of 1968. But the picture changed in
the 1970 decline, and at the low prices of that year a goodly number
of common stocks could have been bought at below their working-
capital value. It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple
to say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at
a price less than the applicable net current assets alone—after deduct-
ing all prior claims, and counting as zero the fixed and other assets—
the  results  should  be  quite  satisfactory.  They  were  so,  in  our
experience, for more than 30 years—say, between 1923 and 1957—
excluding a time of real trial in 1930–1932.

Has this approach any relevance at the beginning of 1971? Our
answer  would  be  a  qualified  “yes.” A quick  runover  of  the  Stock
Guide would have uncovered some 50 or more issues that appeared
to  be  obtainable  at  or  below  net-current-asset  value. As  might  be
expected a good many of these had been doing badly in the diffi-
cult  year  1970.  If  we  eliminated  those  which  had  reported  net
losses  in  the  last  12-month  period  we  would  be  still  left  with
enough issues to make up a diversified list.

We have  included  in  Table  15-2  some  data  on  five  issues  that
sold at less than their working-capital value* at their low prices of

1970.  These  give  some  food  for  reflection  on  the  nature  of  stock-
price  fluctuations.  How  does  it  come  about  that  well-established
companies, whose brands are household names all over the coun-
try,  could  be  valued  at  such  low  figures—at  the  same  time  when
other concerns (with better earnings growth of course) were selling
for  billions  of  dollars  in  excess  of  what  their  balance  sheets
showed? To quote the “old days” once more, the idea of good will
as  an  element  of  intangible  value  was  usually  associated  with  a
“trade name.” Names such as Lady Pepperell in sheets, Jantzen in
swim suits, and Parker in pens would be considered assets of great
value indeed. But now, if the “market doesn’t like a company,” not
only  renowned  trade  names  but  land,  buildings,  machinery,  and
what  you  will,  can  all  count  for  nothing  in  its  scales.  Pascal  said
that  “the  heart  has  its  reasons  that  the  reason  doesn’t  under-
stand.”* For “heart” read “Wall Street.”

There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is
good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no qual-
ity  at  all  make  their  appearance.  They  quickly  find  buyers;  their
prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels
in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and
Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with
no  overt  efforts  by  anyone  to  call  a  halt  before  the  inevitable  col-
lapse in prices. (The SEC can’t do much more than insist on disclo-
sure  of  information,  about  which  the  speculative  public  couldn’t
care  less,  or  announce  investigations  and  usually  mild  punitive
actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly
broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enter-
prises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophi-
cally  enough  as  “part  of  the  game.”  Everybody  swears  off  such
inexcusable extravagances—until next time.

Thanks  for  the  lecture,  says  the  gentle  reader.  But  what  about
your “bargain issues”? Can one really make money in them with-
out  taking  a  serious  risk?  Yes  indeed,  if you  can  find  enough  of
them to make a diversified group, and if you don’t lose patience if

* Le coeur  a  ses  raisons  que  la  raison  ne  connaît  point. This  poetic  pas-
sage is one of the concluding arguments in the great French theologian’s
discussion of what has come to be known as “Pascal’s wager” (see com-
mentary on Chapter 20).

Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

they  fail  to  advance  soon  after  you  buy  them.  Sometimes  the
patience  needed  may  appear  quite  considerable.  In  our  previous
edition we hazarded a single example (p. 188) which was current
as  we  wrote.  It  was  Burton-Dixie  Corp.,  with  stock  selling  at  20,
against net-current-asset value of 30, and book value of about 50. A
profit  on  that  purchase  would  not  have  been  immediate.  But  in
August 1967 all the shareholders were offered 533⁄4 for their shares,
probably  at  just  about  book  value.  A patient  holder,  who  had
bought the shares in March 1964 at 20 would have had a profit of
165% in 31⁄2 years—a noncompounded annual return of 47%. Most
of the bargain issues in our experience have not taken that long to
show good profits–nor have they shown so high a rate. For a some-
what  similar  situation,  current  as  we  write,  see  our  discussion  of
National Presto Industries above, p. 168.

Special Situations or “Workouts”

Let us touch briefly on this area, since it is theoretically includ-
able  in  the  program  of  operations  of  an  enterprising  investor.  It
was commented upon above. Here we shall supply some examples
of the genre, and some further remarks on what it appears to offer
an open-minded and alert investor.

Three such situations, among others, were current early in 1971,

and they may be summarized as follows:

Situation 1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January
1971  Borden  Inc.  announced  a  plan  to  acquire  control  of  Kayser-
Roth (“diversified apparel”) by giving 11⁄3 shares of its own stock in
exchange  for  one  share  of  Kayser-Roth.  On  the  following  day,  in
active  trading.  Borden  closed  at  26  and  Kayser-Roth  at  28.  If  an
“operator” had bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Bor-
den at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the
announced terms, he would have had a profit of some 24% on the
cost of his shares, less commissions and some other items. Assum-
ing the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might
have been at about a 40% per annum rate.

Situation 2.  In  November  1970  National  Biscuit  Co.  offered  to
buy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at $11 in cash. The stock was sell-
ing at about 81⁄2; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at
year-end. Here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25%,
subject to the risks of nonconsummation and to the time element.

394

The Intelligent Investor

Situation 3. Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business
operations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.
The treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of
about $281⁄2 per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form.
The stock closed 1970 at 211⁄2, indicating a possible gross profit here, if
book value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.

If  operations  of  this  kind,  conducted  on  a  diversified  basis  for
spreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,
20%  or  better,  they  would  undoubtedly  be  more  than  merely
worthwhile. Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are
not going into the details of the business—for it really is a business.
Let  us  point  out  two  contradictory  developments  there  in  recent
years.  On  the  one  hand  the  number  of  deals  to  choose  from  has
increased enormously, as compared with, say, ten years ago. This is
a consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to
diversify their activities through various types of acquisitions, etc.
In 1970 the number of “merger announcements” aggregated some
5,000,  down  from  over  6,000  in  1969.  The  total  money  values
involved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhaps
only a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-
sented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-
situations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep him
busy studying, picking, and choosing.

The other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of
the mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of
course,  the  aimed-for  profit  is  not  realized,  and  is  likely  to  be
replaced by a more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are
numerous,  including  antitrust  intervention,  shareholder  opposi-
tion, change in “market conditions,” unfavorable indications from
further  study,  inability  to  agree  on  details,  and  others.  The  trick
here, of course, is to have the judgment, buttressed by experience,
to pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are
likely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail.*

* As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is wholly
inappropriate for most individual investors.

Further Comment on the Examples Above

Kayser-Roth. The  directors  of  this  company  had  already
rejected  (in  January  1971)  the  Borden  proposal  when  this  chapter
was written. If the operation had been “undone” immediately the
overall  loss,  including  commissions,  would  have  been  about  12%
of the cost of the Kayser-Roth shares.

Aurora Plastics. Because of the bad showing of this company
in 1970 the takeover terms were renegotiated and the price reduced
to 101⁄2. The shares were paid for at the end of May. The annual rate
of return realized here was about 25%.

Universal-Marion. This  company  promptly  made  an  initial
distribution in cash and stock worth about $7 per share, reducing
the investment to say 141⁄2. However the market price fell as low as
13 subsequently, casting doubt on the ultimate outcome of the liq-
uidation.

Assuming  that  the  three  examples  given  are  fairly  representa-
tive of “workout or arbitrage” opportunities as a whole in 1971, it
is clear that they are not attractive if entered into upon a random
basis.  This  has  become  more  than  ever  a  field  for  professionals,
with the requisite experience and judgment.

There  is  an  interesting  sidelight  on  our  Kayser-Roth  example.
Late in 1971 the price fell below 20 while Borden was selling at 25,
equivalent to 33 for Kayser-Roth under the terms of the exchange
offer.  It  would  appear  that  either  the  directors  had  made  a  great
mistake in turning down that opportunity or the shares of Kayser-
Roth were now badly undervalued in the market. Something for a
security analyst to look into.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 15

It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy
in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in
the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the inde-
pendence of solitude.

Max  Heine,  founder  of  the  Mutual  Series  Funds,  liked  to  say  that
“there are many roads to Jerusalem.” What this masterly stock picker
meant  was  that  his  own  value-centered  method  of  selecting  stocks
was not the only way to be a successful investor. In this chapter we’ll
look at several techniques that some of today’s leading money man-
agers use for picking stocks.

First, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors, selecting
individual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact that most
professionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most
amateurs  can  do  better.  The  vast  majority  of  people  who  try  to  pick
stocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the lucki-
est ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take years to
learn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own
stocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help, ideally through
an index fund.

Graham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest
athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per-
formance. He suggested starting off by spending a year tracking and
picking stocks (but not with real money).1 In Graham’s day, you would

have  practiced  using  a  ledger  of  hypothetical  buys  and  sells  on  a 
legal pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites like
www.morningstar.com,  http://finance.yahoo.com,  http://money.cnn.
com/services/portfolio/  or  www.marketocracy.com  (at  the  last  site,
ignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).

By test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,
you  can  make  mistakes  without  incurring  any  actual  losses,  develop
the  discipline  to  avoid  frequent  trading,  compare  your  approach
against those of leading money managers, and learn what works for
you. Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-
vent  you  from  forgetting  that  some  of  your  hunches  turn  out  to  be
stinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners and your losers.
After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if
you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’t
enjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selecting
individual  stocks  is  not  for  you.  Get  yourself  an  index  fund  and  stop
wasting your time on stock picking.

If you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,
gradually  assemble  a  basket  of  stocks—but  limit  it  to  a  maximum  of
10%  of  your  overall  portfolio  (keep  the  rest  in  an  index  fund).  And
remember,  you  can  always  stop  if  it  no  longer  interests  you  or  your
returns turn bad.

So  how  should  you  go  about  looking  for  a  potentially  rewarding
stock?  You  can  use  websites  like  http://finance.yahoo.com  and
www.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug-
gested in Chapter 14. Or you can take a more patient, craftsmanlike
approach. Unlike most people, many of the best professional investors
first get interested in a company when its share price goes down, not
up.  Christopher  Browne  of  Tweedy  Browne  Global  Value  Fund,
William Nygren of the Oakmark Fund, Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capi-
tal Fund, and Robert Torray of the Torray Fund all suggest looking at
the  daily  list  of  new  52-week  lows  in  the  Wall  Street  Journal or  the
similar table in the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point
you  toward  stocks  and  industries  that  are  unfashionable  or  unloved
and  that  thus  offer  the  potential  for  high  returns  once  perceptions
change.

Net income or earnings per share (EPS) has been distorted in
recent years by factors like stock-option grants and accounting
gains and charges. To see how much a company is truly earning
on the capital it deploys in its businesses, look beyond EPS to
ROIC,  or  return  on  invested  capital.  Christopher  Davis  of  the
Davis Funds defines it with this formula:

ROIC = Owner Earnings (cid:3) Invested Capital,

where Owner Earnings is equal to:

Operating profit

plus depreciation

plus amortization of goodwill

minus Federal income tax (paid at the company’s average rate)

minus cost of stock options

minus “maintenance” (or essential) capital expenditures

minus any income generated by unsustainable rates of return on
pension funds (as of 2003, anything greater than 6.5%)

and where Invested Capital is equal to:

Total assets

minus cash (as well as short-term investments and non-interest-
bearing current liabilities)

plus past accounting charges that reduced invested capital.

ROIC has the virtue of showing, after all legitimate expenses,
what  the  company  earns  from  its  operating  businesses—and
how efficiently it has used the shareholders’ money to generate
that return. An ROIC of at least 10% is attractive; even 6% or
7%  can  be  tempting  if  the  company  has  good  brand  names,
focused management, or is under a temporary cloud.

Mason  Value  Trust  like  to  see  rising  returns  on  invested  capital,  or
ROIC—a way of measuring how efficiently a company generates what
Warren  Buffett  has  called  “owner  earnings.” 2 (See  the  sidebar  on 
p. 398 for more detail.)

By  checking  “comparables,”  or  the  prices  at  which  similar  busi-
nesses have been acquired over the years, managers like Oakmark’s
Nygren  and  Longleaf  Partners’  O.  Mason  Hawkins  get  a  better 
handle  on  what  a  company’s  parts  are  worth.  For  an  individual
investor,  it’s  painstaking  and  difficult  work:  Start  by  looking  at  the
“Business Segments” footnote in the company’s annual report, which
typically lists the industrial sector, revenues, and earnings of each sub-
sidiary.  (The  “Management  Discussion  and  Analysis”  may  also  be
helpful.)  Then  search  a  news  database  like  Factiva,  ProQuest,  or 
LexisNexis for examples of other firms in the same industries that have
recently been acquired. Using the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov
to locate their past annual reports, you may be able to determine the
ratio of purchase price to the earnings of those acquired companies.
You  can  then  apply  that  ratio  to  estimate  how  much  a  corporate
acquirer might pay for a similar division of the company you are inves-
tigating.

By separately analyzing each of the company’s divisions this way,
you may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current
stock  price.  Longleaf’s  Hawkins  likes  to  find  what  he  calls  “60-cent
dollars,”  or  companies  whose  stock  is  trading  at  60%  or  less  of  the
value  at  which  he  appraises  the  businesses.  That  helps  provide  the
margin of safety that Graham insists on.

Finally,  most  leading  professional  investors  want  to  see  that  a  com-
pany is run by people who, in the words of Oakmark’s William Nygren,
“think  like  owners,  not  just  managers.”  Two  simple  tests:  Are  the
company’s financial statements easily understandable, or are they full
of  obfuscation?  Are  “nonrecurring”  or  “extraordinary”  or  “unusual”
charges just that, or do they have a nasty habit of recurring?

Longleaf’s Mason Hawkins looks for corporate managers who are

“good  partners”—meaning  that  they  communicate  candidly  about
problems, have clear plans for allocating current and future cash flow,
and  own  sizable  stakes  in  the  company’s  stock  (preferably  through
cash  purchases  rather  than  through  grants  of  options).  But  “if  man-
agements  talk  more  about  the  stock  price  than  about  the  business,”
warns  Robert  Torray  of  the  Torray  Fund,  “we’re  not  interested.”
Christopher Davis of the Davis Funds favors firms that limit issuance
of stock options to roughly 3% of shares outstanding.

At Vanguard Primecap Fund, Howard Schow tracks “what the com-
pany said one year and what happened the next. We want to see not
only  whether  managements  are  honest  with  shareholders  but  also
whether  they’re  honest  with  themselves.”  (If  a  company  boss  insists
that all is hunky-dory when business is sputtering, watch out!) Nowa-
days, you can listen in on a company’s regularly scheduled conference
calls even if you own only a few shares; to find out the schedule, call
the  investor  relations  department  at  corporate  headquarters  or  visit
the company’s website.

Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capital Fund turns to the back page of
the  company’s  annual  report,  where  the  heads  of  its  operating  divi-
sions are listed. If there’s a lot of turnover in those names in the first
one or two years of a new CEO’s regime, that’s probably a good sign;
he’s cleaning out the dead wood. But if high turnover continues, the
turnaround has probably devolved into turmoil.

There  are  even  more  roads  to  Jerusalem  than  these.  Some  leading
portfolio managers, like David Dreman of Dreman Value Management
and Martin Whitman of the Third Avenue Funds, focus on companies
selling at very low multiples of assets, earnings, or cash flow. Others,
like Charles Royce of the Royce Funds and Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock Fund, hunt for undervalued small companies. And,
for an all-too-brief look at how today’s most revered investor, Warren
Buffett, selects companies, see the sidebar on p. 401.

One technique that can be helpful: See which leading professional
money managers own the same stocks you do. If one or two names
keep  turning  up,  go  to  the  websites  of  those  fund  companies  and
download  their  most  recent  reports.  By  seeing  which  other  stocks

Graham’s  greatest  student,  Warren  Buffett,  has  become  the
world’s  most  successful  investor  by  putting  new  twists  on
Graham’s ideas. Buffett and his partner, Charles Munger, have
combined  Graham’s  “margin  of  safety”  and  detachment  from
the market with their own innovative emphasis on future growth.
Here is an all-too-brief summary of Buffett’s approach:

He looks for what he calls “franchise” companies with strong
consumer  brands,  easily  understandable  businesses,  robust
financial health, and near-monopolies in their markets, like H & R
Block,  Gillette,  and  the  Washington  Post  Co.  Buffett  likes  to
snap  up  a  stock  when  a  scandal,  big  loss,  or  other  bad  news
passes over it like a storm cloud—as when he bought Coca-Cola
soon after its disastrous rollout of “New Coke” and the market
crash  of  1987.  He  also  wants  to  see  managers  who  set  and
meet  realistic  goals;  build  their  businesses  from  within  rather
than through acquisition; allocate capital wisely; and do not pay
themselves  hundred-million-dollar  jackpots  of  stock  options.
Buffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings, so
the company will be worth more in the future than it is today.

In  his  annual  reports,  archived  at  www.berkshirehathaway.
com, Buffett has set out his thinking like an open book. Probably
no other investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more
about  his  approach  or  written  such  compellingly  readable
essays.  (One  classic  Buffett  proverb:  “When  a  management
with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputa-
tion for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that
remains intact.”) Every intelligent investor can—and should—learn
by reading this master’s own words.

have in common; by reading the managers’ commentary, you may get
ideas on how to improve your own approach.3

No matter which techniques they use in picking stocks, successful
investing professionals have two things in common: First, they are dis-
ciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when
it is unfashionable. Second, they think a great deal about what they do
and how to do it, but they pay very little attention to what the market is
doing.

3 There are also many newsletters dedicated to analyzing professional port-
folios, but most of them are a waste of time and money for even the most
enterprising  investor.  A  shining  exception  for  people  who  can  spare  the
cash is Outstanding Investor Digest (www.oid.com).

Convertible Issues and Warrants

Convertible  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  have  been  taking  on  a
predominant  importance  in  recent  years  in  the  field  of  senior
financing.  As  a  parallel  development,  stock-option  warrants—
which  are  long-term  rights  to  buy  common  shares  at  stipulated
prices—have  become  more  and  more  numerous.  More  than  half
the  preferred  issues  now  quoted  in  the  Standard  &  Poor’s  Stock
Guide have conversion privileges, and this has been true also of a
major part of the corporate bond financing in 1968–1970. There are
at least 60 different series of stock-option warrants dealt in on the
American Stock Exchange. In 1970, for the first time in its history,
the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  listed  an  issue  of  long-term  war-
rants, giving rights to buy 31,400,000 American Tel. & Tel. shares at
$52  each.  With  “Mother  Bell”  now  leading  that  procession,  it  is
bound to be augmented by many new fabricators of warrants. (As
we  shall  point  out  later,  they  are  a  fabrication  in  more  than  one
sense.)*

In the overall picture the convertible issues rank as much more
important than the warrants, and we shall discuss them first. There
are two main aspects to be considered from the standpoint of the
investor. First, how do they rank as investment opportunities and
risks?  Second,  how  does  their  existence  affect  the  value  of  the
related common-stock issues?

Convertible issues are claimed to be especially advantageous to
both the investor and the issuing corporation. The investor receives
the  superior  protection  of  a  bond  or  preferred  stock,  plus  the
opportunity to participate in any substantial rise in the value of the

* Graham detested warrants, as he makes clear on pp. 413–416.

common  stock.  The  issuer  is  able  to  raise  capital  at  a  moderate
interest or preferred dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity
materializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav-
ing it exchanged into common stock. Thus both sides to the bargain
will fare unusually well.

Obviously  the  foregoing  paragraph  must  overstate  the  case
somewhere, for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar-
gain  much  better  for  both  sides.  In  exchange  for  the  conversion
privilege  the  investor  usually  gives  up  something  important  in
quality  or  yield,  or  both.1 Conversely,  if  the  company  gets  its
money at lower cost because of the conversion feature, it is surren-
dering in return part of the common shareholders’ claim to future
enhancement.  On  this  subject  there  are  a  number  of  tricky  argu-
ments to be advanced both pro and con. The safest conclusion that
can be reached is that convertible issues are like any other form of
security,  in  that  their  form  itself  guarantees  neither  attractiveness
nor  unattractiveness.  That  question  will  depend  on  all  the  facts
surrounding the individual issue.*

We do  know,  however,  that  the  group  of  convertible  issues
floated  during  the  latter  part  of  a  bull  market  are  bound  to  yield
unsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,
unfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done
in  the  past.)  The  poor  consequences  must  be  inevitable,  from  the
timing itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invari-
ably  make  the  conversion  privilege  much  less  attractive—and
often,  also,  call  into  question  the  underlying  safety  of  the  issue
itself.† As a group illustration we shall retain the example used in

* Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric that investors
usually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically offer “the best of both
worlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand. What
Wall  Street  gives  with  one  hand,  it  usually  takes  away  with  the  other.  An
investment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the
best of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.
† According  to  Goldman  Sachs  and  Ibbotson  Associates,  from  1998
through  2002,  convertibles  generated  an  average  annual  return  of  4.8%.
That was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks, but
substantially  worse  than  the  returns  of  medium-term  corporate  bonds  (a

straight  (nonconvertible)  preferreds  offered  in  1946,  the  closing
year of the bull market preceding the extraordinary one that began
in 1949.

A comparable  presentation  is  difficult  to  make  for  the  years
1967–1970,  because  there  were  virtually  no  new  offerings  of  non-
convertibles  in  those  years.  But  it  is  easy  to  demonstrate  that  the
average price decline of convertible preferred stocks from Decem-
ber  1967  to  December  1970  was  greater  than  that  for  common
stocks as a whole (which lost only 5%). Also the convertibles seem
to  have  done  quite  a  bit  worse  than  the  older  straight  preferred
shares  during  the  period  December  1968  to  December  1970,  as  is

the  mid-1990s,  according  to  Merrill  Lynch,  roughly  $15  billion  in  convert-
ibles  were  issued  annually;  by  1999,  issuance  had  more  than  doubled  to
$39 billion. In 2000, $58 billion in convertibles were issued, and in 2001,
another  $105  billion  emerged.  As  Graham  warns,  convertible  securities
always  come  out  of  the  woodwork  near  the  end  of  a  bull  market—largely
because even poor-quality companies then have stock returns high enough
to make the conversion feature seem attractive.

(Standard & Poor’s composite index of 500 common stocks declined 11.3%.)

comparisons  would  demonstrate  that  convertible  securities  as  a
whole have relatively poor quality as senior issues and also are tied
to  common  stocks  that  do  worse  than  the  general  market  except
during a speculative upsurge. These observations do not apply to
all convertible issues, of course. In the 1968 and 1969 particularly, a
fair number of strong companies used convertible issues to combat
the inordinately high interest rates for even first-quality bonds. But
it  is  noteworthy  that  in  our  20-stock  sample  of  convertible  pre-
ferreds only one showed an advance and 14 suffered bad declines.*

* Recent structural changes in the convertible market have negated some of
these  criticisms.  Convertible  preferred  stock,  which  made  up  roughly  half
the  total  convertible  market  in  Graham’s  day,  now  accounts  for  only  an
eighth of the market. Maturities are shorter, making convertible bonds less
volatile,  and  many  now  carry  “call  protection,”  or  assurances  against  early
redemption.  And  more  than  half  of  all  convertibles  are  now  investment
grade, a significant improvement in credit quality from Graham’s time. Thus,
in 2002, the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertible Index lost 8.6%—versus the
22.1%  loss  of  the  S  &  P  500-stock  index  and  the  31.3%  decline  in  the
NASDAQ Composite stock index.

Convertible Issues and Warrants

407

The conclusion to be drawn from these figures is not that con-
vertible issues are in themselves less desirable than nonconvertible
or  “straight”  securities.  Other  things  being  equal,  the  opposite  is
true. But we clearly see that other things are not equal in practice
and  that  the  addition  of  the  conversion  privilege  often—perhaps
generally—betrays  an  absence  of  genuine  investment  quality  for
the issue.

It is true, of course, that a convertible preferred is safer than the
common  stock  of  the  same  company—that  is  to  say,  it  carries
smaller risk of eventual loss of principal. Consequently those who
buy new convertibles instead of the corresponding common stock
are logical to that extent. But in most cases the common would not
have been an intelligent purchase to begin with, at the ruling price,
and the substitution of the convertible preferred did not improve
the picture sufficiently. Furthermore, a good deal of the buying of
convertibles was done by investors who had no special interest or
confidence  in  the  common  stock—that  is,  they  would  never  have
thought  of  buying  the  common  at  the  time—but  who  were
tempted  by  what  seemed  an  ideal  combination  of  a  prior  claim
plus a conversion privilege close to the current market. In a num-
ber of instances this combination has worked out well, but the sta-
tistics seem to show that it is more likely to prove a pitfall.

In connection with the ownership of convertibles there is a spe-
cial  problem  which  most  investors  fail  to  realize.  Even  when  a
profit appears it brings a dilemma with it. Should the holder sell on
a small rise; should he hold for a much bigger advance; if the issue
is called—as often happens when the common has gone up consid-
erably—should he sell out then or convert into and retain the com-
mon stock?*

Let us talk in concrete terms. You buy a 6% bond at 100, convert-
ible into stock at 25—that is, at the rate of 40 shares for each $1,000
bond. The stock goes to 30, which makes the bond worth at least
120, and so it sells at 125. You either sell or hold. If you hold, hop-
ing for a higher price, you are pretty much in the position of a com-

* A bond is “called” when the issuing corporation forcibly pays it off ahead
of  the  stated  maturity  date,  or  final  due  date  for  interest  payments.  For  a
brief summary of how convertible bonds work, see Note 1 in the commen-
tary on this chapter (p. 418).

408

The Intelligent Investor

mon shareholder, since if the stock goes down your bond will go
down  too. A conservative  person  is  likely  to  say  that  beyond  125
his position has become too speculative, and therefore he sells and
makes a gratifying 25% profit.

So far, so good. But pursue the matter a bit. In many cases where
the holder sells at 125 the common stock continues to advance, car-
rying  the  convertible  with  it,  and  the  investor  experiences  that
peculiar  pain  that  comes  to  the  man  who  has  sold  out  much  too
soon.  The  next  time,  he  decides  to  hold  for  150  or  200.  The  issue
goes up to 140 and he does not sell. Then the market breaks and his
bond slides down to 80. Again he has done the wrong thing.

Aside  from  the  mental  anguish  involved  in  making  these  bad
guesses—and  they  seem  to  be  almost  inevitable—there  is  a  real
arithmetical  drawback  to  operations  in  convertible  issues.  It  may
be  assumed  that  a  stern  and  uniform  policy  of  selling  at  25%  or
30%  profit  will  work  out  best  as  applied  to  many  holdings.  This
would then mark the upper limit of profit and would be realized
only on the issues that worked out well. But, if—as appears to be
true—these  issues  often  lack  adequate  underlying  security  and
tend to be floated and purchased in the latter stages of a bull mar-
ket, then a goodly proportion of them will fail to rise to 125 but will
not  fail  to  collapse  when  the  market  turns  downward.  Thus  the
spectacular  opportunities  in  convertibles  prove  to  be  illusory  in
practice,  and  the  overall  experience  is  marked  by  fully  as  many
substantial losses—at least of a temporary kind—as there are gains
of similar magnitude.

Because of the extraordinary length of the 1950–1968 bull market,
convertible issues as a whole gave a good account of themselves for
some 18 years. But this meant only that the great majority of common
stocks enjoyed large advances, in which most convertible issues were
able to share. The soundness of investment in convertible issues can
only be tested by their performance in a declining stock market—and
this has always proved disappointing as a whole.*

In our first edition (1949) we gave an illustration of this special

* In  recent  years,  convertibles  have  tended  to  outperform  the  Standard  &
Poor’s 500-stock index during declining stock markets, but they have typi-

negate, the criticism Graham makes here.

problem  of  “what  to  do”  with  a  convertible  when  it  goes  up.  We
believe it still merits inclusion here. Like several of our references it
is based on our own investment operations. We were members of a
“select group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a
private offering of convertible 41⁄2% debentures of Eversharp Co. at
par,  convertible  into  common  stock  at  $40  per  share.  The  stock
advanced rapidly to 651⁄2, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the
equivalent of 88. The latter price made the convertible debentures
worth  no  less  than  220.  During  this  period  the  two  issues  were
called at a small premium; hence they were practically all converted
into common stock, which was retained by a number of the original
investment-fund  buyers  of  the  debentures.  The  price  promptly
began a severe decline, and in March 1948 the stock sold as low as
73⁄8. This represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues, or a
loss of 75% of the original price instead of a profit of over 100%.

The real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers
converted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its
great decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall
Street, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this
advice? Because once you convert you have lost your strategic com-
bination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive
profit. You have probably turned from investor into speculator, and
quite often at an unpropitious time (because the stock has already
had  a  large  advance).  If  “Never  convert  a  convertible”  is  a  good
rule, how came it that these experienced fund managers exchanged
their Eversharp bonds for stock, to their subsequent embarrassing
loss? The answer, no doubt, is that they let themselves be carried
away by enthusiasm for the company’s prospects as well as by the
“favorable market action” of the shares. Wall Street has a few pru-
dent principles; the trouble is that they are always forgotten when
they are most needed.* Hence that other famous dictum of the old-
timers: “Do as I say, not as I do.”

Our  general  attitude  toward  new  convertible  issues  is  thus  a
mistrustful  one.  We  mean  here,  as  in  other  similar  observations,

that the investor should look more than twice before he buys them.
After such hostile scrutiny he may find some exceptional offerings
that are too good to refuse. The ideal combination, of course, is a
strongly  secured  convertible,  exchangeable  for  a  common  stock
which itself is attractive, and at a price only slightly higher than the
current  market.  Every  now  and  then  a  new  offering  appears  that
meets these requirements. By the nature of the securities markets,
however, you are more likely to find such an opportunity in some
older  issue  which  has  developed  into  a  favorable  position  rather
than in a new flotation. (If a new issue is a really strong one, it is
not likely to have a good conversion privilege.)

The fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in
a  standard-type  convertible  issue  is  well  illustrated  by  the  exten-
sive use of this type of security in the financing of American Tele-
phone & Telegraph Company. Between 1913 and 1957 the company
sold  at  least  nine  separate  issues  of  convertible  bonds,  most  of
them through subscription rights to shareholders. The convertible
bonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in
a much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a
stock offering, since the bonds were popular with many financial
institutions which possess huge resources but some of which were
not permitted to buy stocks. The interest return on the bonds has
generally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on
the stock—a factor that was calculated to offset the prior claim of
the  bondholders.  Since  the  company  maintained  its  $9  dividend
rate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split in 1959) the result was
the eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into
common  stock.  Thus  the  buyers  of  these  convertibles  have  fared
well through the years—but not quite so well as if they had bought
the  capital  stock  in  the  first  place.  This  example  establishes  the
soundness of American Telephone & Telegraph, but not the intrin-
sic  attractiveness  of  convertible  bonds.  To  prove  them  sound  in
practice  we  should  need  to  have  a  number  of  instances  in  which
the  convertible  worked  out  well  even  though  the  common  stock
proved disappointing. Such instances are not easy to find.*

* AT&T Corp. no longer is a significant issuer of convertible bonds. Among
the largest issuers of convertibles today are General Motors, Merrill Lynch,
Tyco International, and Roche.

Effect of Convertible Issues on the Status of 
the Common Stock

In a large number of cases convertibles have been issued in con-
nection with mergers or new acquisitions. Perhaps the most strik-
ing  example  of  this  financial  operation  was  the  issuance  by  the
NVF Corp. of nearly $100,000,000 of its 5% convertible bonds (plus
warrants)  in  exchange  for  most  of  the  common  stock  of  Sharon
Steel Co. This extraordinary deal is discussed below pp. 429–433.
Typically  the  transaction  results  in  a  pro  forma  increase  in  the
reported earnings per share of common stock; the shares advance
in response to their larger earnings, so-called, but also because the
management has given evidence of its energy, enterprise, and abil-
ity  to  make  more  money  for  the  shareholders.*  But  there  are  two
offsetting factors, one of which is practically ignored and the other
entirely so in optimistic markets. The first is the actual dilution of
the  current  and  future  earnings  on  the  common  stock  that  flows
arithmetically from the new conversion rights. This dilution can be
quantified by taking the recent earnings, or assuming some other
figures,  and  calculating  the  adjusted  earnings  per  share  if  all  the
convertible shares or bonds were actually converted. In the major-
ity of companies the resulting reduction in per-share figures is not
significant.  But  there  are  numerous  exceptions  to  this  statement,
and there is danger that they will grow at an uncomfortable rate.
The  fast-expanding  “conglomerates”  have  been  the  chief  practi-
tioners of convertible legerdemain. In Table 16-3 we list seven com-
panies  with  large  amounts  of  stock  issuable  on  conversions  or
against warrants.†

true  if  the  preferred  stock  had  a  conversion  privilege  close  to  the
market.  The  reverse  is  generally  true  at  present. As  a  result  there
are  a  considerable  number  of  convertible  preferred  stocks  which
are clearly more attractive than the related common shares. Own-
ers of the common have nothing to lose and important advantages
to gain by switching from their junior shares into the senior issue.

Example:  A typical  example  was  presented  by  Studebaker-
Worthington  Corp.  at  the  close  of  1970.  The  common  sold  at  57,
while the $5 convertible preferred finished at 871⁄2. Each preferred
share  is  exchangeable  for  11⁄2 shares  of  common,  then  worth  851⁄2.
This would indicate a small money difference against the buyer of
the preferred. But dividends are being paid on the common at the
annual  rate  of  $1.20  (or  $1.80  for  the  11⁄2 shares),  against  the  $5
obtainable on one share of preferred. Thus the original adverse dif-
ference  in  price  would  probably  be  made  up  in  less  than  a  year,
after  which  the  preferred  would  probably  return  an  appreciably
higher dividend yield than the common for some time to come. But
most  important,  of  course,  would  be  the  senior  position  that  the
common shareholder would gain from the switch. At the low prices

of 1968 and again in 1970 the preferred sold 15 points higher than
11⁄2 shares  of  common.  Its  conversion  privilege  guarantees  that  it
could never sell lower than the common package.2

Stock-Option Warrants

Let  us  mince  no  words  at  the  outset.  We  consider  the  recent
development of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing
menace, and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate
dollar “values” out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence
except  to  the  extent  that  they  mislead  speculators  and  investors.
They  should  be  prohibited  by  law,  or  at  least  strictly  limited  to  a
minor part of the total capitalization of a company.*

For an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the
reader  to  the  section  of  Faust (part  2),  in  which  Goethe  describes
the  invention  of  paper  money. As  an  ominous  precedent  on  Wall
Street  history,  we  may  mention  the  warrants  of American  &  For-
eign Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a
billion  dollars,  although  they  appeared  only  in  a  footnote  to  the
company’s balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to
$8  million,  and  in  1952  the  warrants  were  wiped  out  in  the
company’s recapitalization—even though it had remained solvent.
Originally,  stock-option  warrants  were  attached  now  and  then
to bond issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion
privilege.  They  were  unimportant  in  amount,  and  hence  did  no
harm. Their use expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other
financial abuses, but they dropped from sight for long years there-
after. They were bound to turn up again, like the bad pennies they
are,  and  since  1967  they  have  become  familiar  “instruments  of

* Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in
the nineteenth century and were fairly common even in Graham’s day. They
have since diminished in importance and popularity—one of the few recent
developments that would give Graham unreserved pleasure. As of year-end
2002,  there  were  only  seven  remaining  warrant  issues  on  the  New  York
Stock Exchange—only the ghostly vestige of a market. Because warrants are
no  longer  commonly  used  by  major  companies,  today’s  investors  should
read the rest of Graham’s chapter only to see how his logic works.

The Intelligent Investor

finance.”  In  fact  a  standard  procedure  has  developed  for  raising
the capital for new real-estate ventures, affiliates of large banks, by
selling units of an equal number of common shares and warrants
to  buy  additional  common  shares  at  the  same  price.  Example: In
1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these combina-
tions of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and war-
rants, for $20 per unit.

Let  us  consider  for  a  moment  what  is  really  involved  in  this
financial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right
to  buy  additional  common  shares  when  the  company’s  directors
find it desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “pre-
emptive  right”  is  one  of  the  elements  of  value  entering  into  the
ownership of common stock—along with the right to receive divi-
dends,  to  participate  in  the  company’s  growth,  and  to  vote  for
directors. When separate warrants are issued for the right to sub-
scribe  additional  capital,  that  action  takes  away  part  of  the  value
inherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate
certificate. An analogous thing could be done by issuing separate
certificates  for  the  right  to  receive  dividends  (for  a  limited  or
unlimited  period),  or  the  right  to  share  in  the  proceeds  of  sale  or
liquidation  of  the  enterprise,  or  the  right  to  vote  the  shares.  Why
then are these subscription warrants created as part of the original
capital  structure?  Simply  because  people  are  inexpert  in  financial
matters.  They  don’t  realize  that  the  common  stock  is  worth  less
with  warrants  outstanding  than  otherwise.  Hence  the  package  of
stock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market
than would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports
the  per-share  earnings  are  (or  have  been)  computed  without
proper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants. The result
is, of course, to overstate the true relationship between the earnings
and the market value of the company’s capitalization.*

* Today,  the  last  remnant  of  activity  in  warrants  is  in  the  cesspool  of  the
NASDAQ  “bulletin  board,”  or  over-the-counter  market  for  tiny  companies,
where common stock is often bundled with warrants into a “unit” (the con-
temporary  equivalent  of  what  Graham  calls  a  “package”).  If  a  stockbroker
ever offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can be 95% certain that
warrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that the broker is either a
thief or an idiot. Legitimate brokers and firms have no business in this area.

Convertible Issues and Warrants

415

The simplest and probably the best method of allowing for the
existence of warrants is to add the equivalent of their market value
to  the  common-share  capitalization,  thus  increasing  the  “true”
market  price  per  share.  Where  large  amounts  of  warrants  have
been  issued  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  senior  securities,  it  is
customary to make the adjustment by assuming that the proceeds
of  the  stock  payment  are  used  to  retire  the  related  bonds  or  pre-
ferred shares. This method does not allow adequately for the usual
“premium  value”  of  a  warrant  above  exercisable  value.  In  Table 
16-4 we compare the effect of the two methods of calculation in the
case of National General Corp. for the year 1970.

Does the company itself derive an advantage from the creation
of these warrants, in the sense that they assure it in some way of
receiving additional capital when it needs some? Not at all. Ordi-
narily there is no way in which the company can require the war-
rant-holders to exercise their rights, and thus provide new capital
to the company, prior to the expiration date of the warrants. In the
meantime, if the company wants to raise additional common-stock
funds it must offer the shares to its shareholders in the usual way—
which  means  somewhat  under  the  ruling  market  price.  The  war-
rants are no help in such an operation; they merely complicate the
situation  by  frequently  requiring  a  downward  revision  in  their
own  subscription  price.  Once  more  we  assert  that  large  issues  of
stock-option warrants serve no purpose, except to fabricate imagi-
nary market values.

The paper money that Goethe was familiar with, when he wrote
his Faust, were  the  notorious  French  assignats  that  had  been
greeted as a marvelous invention, and were destined ultimately to
lose all of their value—as did the billion dollars worth of American
&  Foreign  Power  warrants.*  Some  of  the  poet’s  remarks  apply

* The  “notorious  French  assignats”  were  issued  during  the  Revolution  of
1789. They were originally debts of the Revolutionary government, purport-
edly secured by the value of the real estate that the radicals had seized from
the Catholic church and the nobility. But the Revolutionaries were bad finan-
cial  managers.  In  1790,  the  interest  rate  on  assignats  was  cut;  soon  they
stopped paying interest entirely and were reclassified as paper money. But
the government refused to redeem them for gold or silver and issued massive
amounts of new assignats. They were officially declared worthless in 1797.

Practical Postscript

The crime of the warrants is in “having been born.”* Once born
they function as other security forms, and offer chances of profit as
well  as  of  loss.  Nearly  all  the  newer  warrants  run  for  a  limited
time—generally  between  five  and  ten  years.  The  older  warrants
were often perpetual, and they were likely to have fascinating price
histories over the years.

Example: The record books will show that Tri-Continental Corp.
warrants, which date from 1929, sold at a negligible 1/32 of a dol-
lar each in the depth of the depression. From that lowly estate their
price rose to a magnificent 753⁄4 in 1969, an astronomical advance of
some 242,000%. (The warrants then sold considerably higher than
the shares themselves; this is the kind of thing that occurs on Wall
Street  through  technical  developments,  such  as  stock  splits.)  A
recent example is supplied by Ling-Temco-Vought warrants, which
in  the  first  half  of  1971  advanced  from  21⁄2 to  121⁄2—and  then  fell
back to 4.

No doubt shrewd operations can be carried on in warrants from
time to time, but this is too technical a matter for discussion here.
We might say that warrants tend to sell relatively higher than the
corresponding market components related to the conversion privi-
lege  of  bonds  or  preferred  stocks.  To  that  extent  there  is  a  valid
argument for selling bonds with warrants attached rather than cre-
ating  an  equivalent  dilution  factor  by  a  convertible  issue.  If  the
warrant total is relatively small there is no point in taking its theo-
retical aspect too seriously; if the warrant issue is large relative to
the outstanding stock, that would probably indicate that the com-
pany  has  a  top-heavy  senior  capitalization.  It  should  be  selling
additional common stock instead. Thus the main objective of our
attack  on  warrants  as  a  financial  mechanism  is  not  to  condemn
their  use  in  connection  with  moderate-size  bond  issues,  but  to
argue  against  the  wanton  creation  of  huge  “paper-money”  mon-
strosities of this genre.

* Graham, an enthusiastic reader of Spanish literature, is paraphrasing a line
from the play Life Is a Dream by Pedro Calderon de la Barca (1600–1681):
“The greatest crime of man is having been born.”

Although  convertible  bonds  are  called  “bonds,”  they  behave  like
stocks, work like options, and are cloaked in obscurity.

If  you  own  a  convertible,  you  also  hold  an  option:  You  can  either
keep  the  bond  and  continue  to  earn  interest  on  it,  or  you  can
exchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predeter-
mined ratio. (An option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another
security at a given price within a specific period of time.) Because they
are exchangeable into stock, convertibles pay lower rates of interest
than most comparable bonds. On the other hand, if a company’s stock
price soars, a convertible bond exchangeable into that stock will per-
form  much  better  than  a  conventional  bond.  (Conversely,  the  typical
convertible—with  its  lower  interest  rate—will  fare  worse  in  a  falling
bond market.)1

1 As a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice, consider the
4.75% convertible subordinated notes issued by DoubleClick Inc. in 1999.
They  pay  $47.50  in  interest  per  year  and  are  each  convertible  into  24.24
shares of the company’s common stock, a “conversion ratio” of 24.24. As of
year-end  2002,  DoubleClick’s  stock  was  priced  at  $5.66  a  share,  giving
each bond a “conversion value” of $137.20 ($5.66 (cid:1) 24.24). Yet the bonds
traded  roughly  six  times  higher,  at  $881.30—creating  a  “conversion  pre-
mium,” or excess over their conversion value, of 542%. If you bought at that
price, your “break-even time,” or “payback period,” was very long. (You paid
roughly  $750  more  than  the  conversion  value  of  the  bond,  so  it  will  take
nearly 16 years of $47.50 interest payments for you to “earn back” that con-

From 1957 through 2002, according to Ibbotson Associates, con-
vertible bonds earned an annual average return of 8.3%—only two per-
centage  points  below  the  total  return  on  stocks,  but  with  steadier
prices and shallower losses.2 More income, less risk than stocks: No
wonder  Wall  Street’s  salespeople  often  describe  convertibles  as  a
“best  of  both  worlds”  investment.  But  the  intelligent  investor  will
quickly realize that convertibles offer less income and more risk than
most  other  bonds. So  they  could,  by  the  same  logic  and  with  equal
justice, be called a “worst of both worlds” investment. Which side you
come down on depends on how you use them.

In truth, convertibles act more like stocks than bonds. The return on
convertibles is about 83% correlated to the Standard & Poor’s 500-
stock  index—but  only  about  30%  correlated  to  the  performance  of
Treasury bonds. Thus, “converts” zig when most bonds zag. For con-
servative investors with most or all of their assets in bonds, adding a
diversified  bundle  of  converts  is  a  sensible  way  to  seek  stock-like
returns  without  having  to  take  the  scary  step  of  investing  in  stocks
directly. You could call convertible bonds “stocks for chickens.”

As convertibles expert F. Barry Nelson of Advent Capital Manage-
ment points out, this roughly $200 billion market has blossomed since
Graham’s day. Most converts are now medium-term, in the seven-to-
10-year  range;  roughly  half  are  investment-grade;  and  many  issues
now carry some call protection (an assurance against early redemp-
tion). All these factors make them less risky than they used to be.3

version premium.) Since each DoubleClick bond is convertible to just over
24 common shares, the stock will have to rise from $5.66 to more than $36
if  conversion  is  to  become  a  practical  option  before  the  bonds  mature  in
2006. Such a stock return is not impossible, but it borders on the miracu-
lous. The cash yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate, given
the low probability of conversion.
2 Like many of the track records commonly cited on Wall Street, this one is
hypothetical.  It  indicates  the  return  you  would  have  earned  in  an  imagin-
ary  index  fund  that  owned  all  major  convertibles.  It  does  not  include  any
management  fees  or  trading  costs  (which  are  substantial  for  convertible
securities). In the real world, your returns would have been roughly two per-
centage points lower.

and bank loans—so, in a bankruptcy, convertible holders do not have prior

Commentary on Chapter 16

It’s expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds, and diversifi-
cation is impractical unless you have well over $100,000 to invest in
this sector alone. Fortunately, today’s intelligent investor has the con-
venient recourse of buying a low-cost convertible bond fund. Fidelity
and  Vanguard  offer  mutual  funds  with  annual  expenses  comfortably
under 1%, while several closed-end funds are also available at a rea-
sonable cost (and, occasionally, at discounts to net asset value).4

On  Wall  Street,  cuteness  and  complexity  go  hand-in-hand—and
convertibles are no exception. Among the newer varieties are a jumble
of  securities  with  acronymic  nicknames  like  LYONS,  ELKS,  EYES,
PERCS, MIPS, CHIPS, and YEELDS. These intricate securities put a
“floor” under your potential losses, but also cap your potential profits
and often compel you to convert into common stock on a fixed date.
Like most investments that purport to ensure against loss (see sidebar
on  p.  421),  these  things  are  generally  more  trouble  than  they  are
worth. You can best shield yourself against loss not by buying one of
these  quirky  contraptions,  but  by  intelligently  diversifying  your  entire
portfolio across cash, bonds, and U.S. and foreign stocks.

claim to the company’s assets. And, while they are not nearly as dicey as
high-yield  “junk”  bonds,  many  converts  are  still  issued  by  companies  with
less  than  sterling  credit  ratings.  Finally,  a  large  portion  of  the  convertible
market  is  held  by  hedge  funds,  whose  rapid-fire  trading  can  increase  the
volatility of prices.
4 For  more  detail,  see  www.fidelity.com,  www.vanguard.com,  and  www.

fund with annual operating expenses exceeding 1.0%.

As the bear market clawed its way through 2003, it dug up an
old fad: writing covered call options. (A recent Google search
on “covered call writing” turned up more than 2,600 hits.) What
are covered calls, and how do they work? Imagine that you buy
100  shares  of  Ixnay  Corp.  at  $95  apiece.  You  then  sell  (or
“write”)  a  call  option  on  your  shares.  In  exchange,  you  get  a
cash payment known as a “call premium.” (Let’s say it’s $10 per
share.) The buyer of the option, meanwhile, has the contractual
right to buy your Ixnay shares at a mutually agreed-upon price—
say, $100. You get to keep the stock so long as it stays below
$100, and you earn a fat $1,000 in premium income, which will
cushion the fall if Ixnay’s stock crashes.

Less risk, more income. What’s not to like?
Well, now imagine that Ixnay’s stock price jumps overnight to
$110.  Then  your  option  buyer  will  exercise  his  rights,  yanking
your shares away for $100 apiece. You’ve still got your $1,000
in income, but he’s got your Ixnay—and the more it goes up, the
harder you will kick yourself.1

Since the potential gain on a stock is unlimited, while no loss
can exceed 100%, the only person you will enrich with this strat-
egy  is  your  broker.  You’ve  put  a  floor  under  your  losses,  but
you’ve  also  slapped  a  ceiling  over  your  gains.  For  individual
investors,  covering  your  downside  is  never  worth  surrendering
most of your upside.

1 Alternatively, you could buy back the call option, but you would have to take

a loss on it—and options can have even higher trading costs than stocks.

tories  represent  extremes  of  various  sorts  that  were  manifest  on
Wall Street in recent years. They hold instruction, and grave warn-
ings, for everyone who has a serious connection with the world of
stocks and bonds—not only for ordinary investors and speculators
but  for  professionals,  security  analysts,  fund  managers,  trust-
account administrators, and even for bankers who lend money to
corporations. The four companies to be reviewed, and the different
extremes that they illustrate are:

Penn Central (Railroad) Co. An extreme example of the neglect of
the most elementary warning signals of financial weakness, by all
those who had bonds or shares of this system under their supervi-
sion. A crazily high market price for the stock of a tottering giant.

Ling-Temco-Vought  Inc. An  extreme  example  of  quick  and
unsound  “empire  building,”  with  ultimate  collapse  practically
guaranteed; but helped by indiscriminate bank lending.

NVF Corp. An extreme example of one corporate acquisition, in
which  a  small  company  absorbed  another  seven  times  its  size,
incurring  a  huge  debt  and  employing  some  startling  accounting
devices.

AAA Enterprises. An extreme example of public stock-financing
of a small company; its value based on the magic word “franchis-
ing,”  and  little  else,  sponsored  by  important  stock-exchange
houses.  Bankruptcy  followed  within  two  years  of  the  stock  sale
and the doubling of the initial inflated price in the heedless stock
market.

The Penn Central Case

This  is  the  country’s  largest  railroad  in  assets  and  gross  rev-
enues.  Its  bankruptcy  in  1970  shocked  the  financial  world.  It  has
defaulted  on  most  of  its  bond  issues,  and  has  been  in  danger  of
abandoning  its  operations  entirely.  Its  security  issues  fell  drasti-
cally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 861⁄2
as recently as 1968 to a low of 51⁄2 in 1970. (There seems little doubt
that these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.)*

Our  basic  point  is  that  the  application  of  the  simplest  rules  of
security analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment
would have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen-
tral system long before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the
shares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its
bond  issues  could  have  been  exchanged  at  even  prices  for  well-
secured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates. The
following comments are in order:

1. In the S & P Bond Guide the interest charges of the system are
shown  to  have  been  earned  1.91  times  in  1967  and  1.98  times  in
1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our
textbook Security  Analysis is  5  times  before  income  taxes  and  2.9
times  after  income  taxes  at  regular  rates.  As  far  as  we  know  the
validity  of  these  standards  has  never  been  questioned  by  any
investment authority. On the basis of our requirements for earnings
after taxes, the Penn Central fell short of the requirements for safety.
But our after-tax requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five
times, with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest. In
the case of Penn Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak
of for the past 11 years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges
before  taxes  was  less  than  two  times—a  totally  inadequate  figure
against our conservative requirement of 5 times.

* How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s bankruptcy,
which was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The closing trade
in Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was $11.25 per share—hardly a
going-out-of-business  price.  In  more  recent  times,  stocks  like  Enron  and
WorldCom  have  also  sold  at  relatively  high  prices  shortly  before  filing  for
bankruptcy protection.

2. The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a
period should have raised serious questions about the validity of its
reported earnings.

3.  The  bonds  of  the  Penn  Central  system  could  have  been
exchanged in 1968 and 1969, at no sacrifice of price or income, for
far  better  secured  issues.  For  example,  in  1969,  Pennsylvania  RR
41⁄2s, due 1994 (part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 741⁄2, while
Pennsylvania Electric Co. 43⁄8s, due 1994, had a range of 641⁄4 to 721⁄4.
The public utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in
1968  against  only  1.98  times  for  the  Penn  Central  system;  during
1969  the  latter’s  comparative  showing  grew  steadily  worse.  An
exchange of this sort was clearly called for, and it would have been
a lifesaver for a Penn Central bondholder. (At the end of 1970 the
railroad  41⁄4s  were  in  default,  and  selling  at  only  181⁄2,  while  the
utility’s 43⁄8s closed at 661⁄2.)

4. Penn Central reported earnings of $3.80 per share in 1968; its
high price of 861⁄2 in that year was 24 times such earnings. But any
analyst  worth  his  salt  would  have  wondered  how  “real”  were
earnings of this sort reported without the necessity of paying any
income taxes thereon.

5.  For  1966  the  newly  merged  company*  had  reported  “earn-
ings”  of  $6.80  a  share—in  reflection  of  which  the  common  stock
later rose to its peak of 861⁄2. This was a valuation of over $2 billion
for the equity. How many of these buyers knew at the time that the
so  lovely  earnings  were  before a  special  charge  of  $275  million  or
$12 per share to be taken in 1971 for “costs and losses” incurred on
the merger. O wondrous fairyland of Wall Street where a company
can announce “profits” of $6.80 per share in one place and special
“costs and losses” of $12 in another, and shareholders and specula-
tors rub their hands with glee!†

* Penn Central was the product of the merger, announced in 1966, of the
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad.
† This  kind  of  accounting  legerdemain,  in  which  profits  are  reported  as  if
“unusual” or “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” charges do not matter, antici-
pates the reliance on “pro forma” financial statements that became popular
in the late 1990s (see the commentary on Chapter 12).

6.  A railroad  analyst  would  have  long  since  known  that  the
operating picture of the Penn Central was very bad in comparison
with  the  more  profitable  roads.  For  example,  its  transportation
ratio was 47.5% in 1968 against 35.2% for its neighbor, Norfolk &
Western.*

7.  Along  the  way  there  were  some  strange  transactions  with
peculiar accounting results.1 Details are too complicated to go into
here.

Conclusion: Whether better management could have saved the
Penn  Central  bankruptcy  may  be  arguable.  But  there  is  no  doubt
whatever that no bonds and no shares of the Penn Central system
should  have  remained  after  1968  at  the  latest  in  any  securities
account watched over by competent security analysts, fund man-
agers, trust officers, or investment counsel. Moral: Security analysts
should  do  their  elementary  jobs  before  they  study  stock-market
movements,  gaze  into  crystal  balls,  make  elaborate  mathematical
calculations, or go on all-expense-paid field trips.†

Ling-Temco-Vought Inc.

This  is  a  story  of  head-over-heels  expansion  and  head-over-
heels debt, ending up in terrific losses and a host of financial prob-
lems.  As  usually  happens  in  such  cases,  a  fair-haired  boy,  or
“young genius,” was chiefly responsible for both the creation of the
great empire and its ignominious downfall; but there is plenty of
blame to be accorded others as well.‡

* A railroad’s “transportation ratio” (now more commonly called its operating
ratio) measures the expenses of running its trains divided by the railroad’s
total  revenues.  The  higher  the  ratio,  the  less  efficient  the  railroad.  Today
even a ratio of 70% would be considered excellent.
† Today,  Penn  Central  is  a  faded  memory.  In  1976,  it  was  absorbed  into
Consolidated  Rail  Corp.  (Conrail),  a  federally-funded  holding  company 
that bailed out several failed railroads. Conrail sold shares to the public in
1987 and, in 1997, was taken over jointly by CSX Corp. and Norfolk South-
ern Corp.
‡ Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. was founded in 1955 by James Joseph Ling, an
electrical contractor who sold his first $1 million worth of shares to the pub-

The Intelligent Investor

The rise and fall of Ling-Temco-Vought can be summarized by
setting  forth  condensed  income  accounts  and  balance-sheet  items
for  five  years  between  1958  and  1970.  This  is  done  in  Table  17-1.
The first column shows the company’s modest beginnings in 1958,
when its sales were only $7 million. The next gives figures for 1960;
the enterprise had grown twentyfold in only two years, but it was
still comparatively small. Then came the heyday years to 1967 and
1968, in which sales again grew twentyfold to $2.8 billion with the
debt figure expanding from $44 million to an awesome $1,653 mil-
lion. In 1969 came new acquisitions, a further huge increase in debt
(to a total of $1,865 million!), and the beginning of serious trouble.
A large  loss,  after  extraordinary  items,  was  reported  for  the  year;
the stock price declined from its 1967 high of 1691⁄2 to a low of 24;
the young genius was superseded as the head of the company. The
1970  results  were  even  more  dreadful.  The  enterprise  reported  a
final  net  loss  of  close  to  $70  million;  the  stock  fell  away  to  a  low
price of 71⁄8, and its largest bond issue was quoted at one time at a
pitiable  15  cents  on  the  dollar.  The  company’s  expansion  policy
was  sharply  reversed,  various  of  its  important  interests  were
placed on the market, and some headway was made in reducing its
mountainous obligations.

The figures in our table speak so eloquently that few comments

are called for. But here are some:

lic by becoming his own investment banker, hawking prospectuses from a
booth set up at the Texas State Fair. His success at that led him to acquire
dozens of different companies, almost always using LTV’s stock to pay for
them.  The  more  companies  LTV  acquired,  the  higher  its  stock  went;  the
higher  its  stock  went,  the  more  companies  it  could  afford  to  acquire.  By
1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune 500 list of major U.S.
corporations. And then, as Graham shows, the whole house of cards came
crashing down. (LTV Corp., now exclusively a steelmaker, ended up seeking
bankruptcy protection in late 2000.) Companies that grow primarily through
acquisitions  are  called  “serial  acquirers”—and  the  similarity  to  the  term
“serial killers” is no accident. As the case of LTV demonstrates, serial acquir-
ers  nearly  always  leave  financial  death  and  destruction  in  their  wake.
Investors who understood this lesson of Graham’s would have avoided such
darlings of the 1990s as Conseco, Tyco, and WorldCom.

The Intelligent Investor

1.  The  company’s  expansion  period  was  not  without  an  inter-
ruption. In 1961 it showed a small operating deficit, but—adopting
a practice that was to be seen later in so many reports for 1970—
evidently  decided  to  throw  all  possible  charges  and  reserves  into
the one bad year.* These amounted to a round $13 million, which
was  more  than  the  combined  net  profits  of  the  preceding  three
years. It was now ready to show “record earnings” in 1962, etc.

2. At the end of 1966 the net tangible assets are given as $7.66 per
share  of  common  (adjusted  for  a  3-for-2  split).  Thus  the  market
price  in  1967  reached  22  times  (!)  its  reported  asset  value  at  the
time.  At  the  end  of  1968  the  balance  sheet  showed  $286  million
available  for  3,800,000  shares  of  common  and  Class AA stock,  or
about  $77  per  share.  But  if  we  deduct  the  preferred  stock  at  full
value and exclude the good-will items and the huge bond-discount
“asset,”† there would remain $13 million for the common—a mere
$3 per share. This tangible equity was wiped out by the losses of
the following years.

3.  Toward  the  end  of  1967  two  of  our  best-regarded  banking
firms  offered  600,000  shares  of  Ling-Temco-Vought  stock  at  $111
per share. It had been as high as 1691⁄2. In less than three years the
price fell to 71⁄8.‡

* The sordid tradition of hiding a company’s true earnings picture under the
cloak of restructuring charges is still with us. Piling up every possible charge
in one year is sometimes called “big bath” or “kitchen sink” accounting. This
bookkeeping gimmick enables companies to make an easy show of appar-
ent  growth  in  the  following  year—but  investors  should  not  mistake  that  for
real business health.
† The  “bond-discount  asset”  appears  to  mean  that  LTV  had  purchased
some  bonds  below  their  par  value  and  was  treating  that  discount  as  an
asset, on the grounds that the bonds could eventually be sold at par. Gra-
ham scoffs at this, since there is rarely any way to know what a bond’s mar-
ket price will be on a given date in the future. If the bonds could be sold only
at values below par, this “asset” would in fact be a liability.
‡ We can only imagine what Graham would have thought of the investment
banking  firms  that  brought  InfoSpace,  Inc.  public  in  December  1998.  The
stock  (adjusted  for  later  splits)  opened  for  trading  at  $31.25,  peaked  at

4. At the end of 1967 the bank loans had reached $161 million,
and  a  year  later  they  stood  at  $414  million—which  should  have
been  a  frightening  figure.  In  addition,  the  long-term  debt
amounted to $1,237 million. By 1969 combined debt reached a total
of  $1,869  million.  This  may  have  been  the  largest  combined  debt
figure of any industrial company anywhere and at any time, with
the single exception of the impregnable Standard Oil of N.J.

5. The losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since

the formation of the company.

Moral: The primary question raised in our mind by the Ling-
Temco-Vought  story  is  how  the  commercial  bankers  could  have
been persuaded to lend the company such huge amounts of money
during  its  expansion  period.  In  1966  and  earlier  the  company’s
coverage of interest charges did not meet conservative standards,
and the same was true of the ratio of current assets to current liabil-
ities and of stock equity to total debt. But in the next two years the
banks  advanced  the  enterprise  nearly  $400  million  additional  for
further “diversification.” This was not good business for them, and
it was worse in its implications for the company’s shareholders. If
the Ling-Temco-Vought case will serve to keep commercial banks
from  aiding  and  abetting  unsound  expansions  of  this  type  in  the
future, some good may come of it at last.*

The NVF Takeover of Sharon Steel (A Collector’s Item)

At the end of 1968 NVF Company was a company with $4.6 mil-
lion of long-term debt, $17.4 million of stock capital, $31 million of
sales,  and  $502,000  of  net  income  (before  a  special  credit  of
$374,000). Its business was described as “vulcanized fiber and plas-
tics.” The management decided to take over the Sharon Steel Corp.,

$1305.32 per share in March 2000, and finished 2002 at a princely $8.45
per share.
* Graham  would  have  been  disappointed,  though  surely  not  surprised,  to
see  that  commercial  banks  have  chronically  kept  supporting  “unsound
expansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in corpo-
rate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank loans.

which had $43 million of long-term debt, $101 million of stock cap-
ital, $219 million of sales, and $2,929,000 of net earnings. The com-
pany it wished to acquire was thus seven times the size of NVF. In
early 1969 it made an offer for all the shares of Sharon. The terms
per share were $70 face amount of NVF junior 5% bonds, due 1994,
plus  warrants  to  buy  11⁄2 shares  of  NVF  stock  at  $22  per  share  of
NVF.  The  management  of  Sharon  strenuously  resisted  this
takeover  attempt,  but  in  vain.  NVF  acquired  88%  of  the  Sharon
stock under the offer, issuing therefore $102 million of its 5% bonds
and warrants for 2,197,000 of its shares. Had the offer been 100%
operative  the  consolidated  enterprise  would,  for  the  year  1968,
have had $163 million in debt, only $2.2 million in tangible stock
capital,  $250  million  of  sales.  The  net-earnings  question  would
have been a bit complicated, but the company subsequently stated
them  as  a  net  loss  of  50  cents  per  share  of  NVF  stocks,  before  an
extraordinary  credit,  and  net  earnings  of  3  cents  per  share  after
such credit.*

First  Comment: Among  all  the  takeovers  effected  in  the  year
1969 this was no doubt the most extreme in its financial dispropor-
tions.  The  acquiring  company  had  assumed  responsibility  for  a
new and top-heavy debt obligation, and it had changed its calcu-
lated 1968 earnings from a profit to a loss into the bargain. A mea-
sure of the impairment of the company’s financial position by this

* In  June  1972  (just  after  Graham  finished  this  chapter),  a  Federal  judge
found that NVF’s chairman, Victor Posner, had improperly diverted the pen-
sion assets of Sharon Steel “to assist affiliated companies in their takeovers
of other corporations.” In 1977, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion secured a permanent injunction against Posner, NVF, and Sharon Steel
to  prevent  them  from  future  violations  of  Federal  laws  against  securities
fraud.  The  Commission  alleged  that  Posner  and  his  family  had  improperly
obtained  $1.7  million  in  personal  perks  from  NVF  and  Sharon,  overstated
Sharon’s  pretax  earnings  by  $13.9  million,  misrecorded  inventory,  and
“shifted  income  and  expenses  from  one  year  to  another.”  Sharon  Steel,
which  Graham  had  singled  out  with  his  cold  and  skeptical  eye,  became
known  among Wall  Street  wags  as  “Share  and  Steal.”  Posner  was  later  a
central  force  in  the  wave  of  leveraged  buyouts  and  hostile  takeovers  that
swept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a major customer for
the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert.

step is found in the fact that the new 5% bonds did not sell higher
than 42 cents on the dollar during the year of issuance. This would
have  indicated  grave  doubt  of  the  safety  of  the  bonds  and  of  the
company’s  future;  however,  the  management  actually  exploited
the bond price in a way to save the company annual income taxes
of about $1,000,000 as will be shown.

The 1968 report, published after the Sharon takeover, contained
a condensed picture of its results, carried back to the year-end. This
contained two most unusual items:

1.  There  is  listed  as  an  asset  $58,600,000  of  “deferred  debt
expense.”  This  sum  is  greater  than  the  entire  “stockholders’
equity,” placed at $40,200,000.

2. However, not included in the shareholders’ equity is an item
of $20,700,000 designated as “excess of equity over cost of invest-
ment in Sharon.”

Second Comment: If we eliminate the debt expense as an asset,
which  it  hardly  seems  to  be,  and  include  the  other  item  in  the
shareholders’  equity  (where  it  would  normally  belong),  then  we
have  a  more  realistic  statement  of  tangible  equity  for  NVF  stock,
viz.,  $2,200,000.  Thus  the  first  effect  of  the  deal  was  to  reduce
NVF’s “real equity” from $17,400,000 to $2,200,000 or from $23.71
per share to about $3 per share, on 731,000 shares. In addition the
NVF shareholders had given to others the right to buy 31⁄2 times as
many additional shares at six points below the market price at the
close  of  1968.  The  initial  market  value  of  the  warrants  was  then
about $12 each, or a total of some $30 million for those involved in
the purchase offer. Actually, the market value of the warrants well
exceeded  the  total  market  value  of  the  outstanding  NVF  stock—
another evidence of the tail-wagging-dog nature of the transaction.

The Accounting Gimmicks

When  we  pass  from  this  pro  forma  balance  sheet  to  the  next
year’s report we find several strange-appearing entries. In addition
to the basic interest expense (a hefty $7,500,000), there is deducted
$1,795,000  for  “amortization  of  deferred  debt  expense.”  But  this
last is nearly offset on the next line by a very unusual income item

432

The Intelligent Investor

indeed:  “amortization  of  equity  over  cost  of  investment  in  sub-
sidiary:  Cr.  $1,650,000.”  In  one  of  the  footnotes  we  find  an  entry,
not appearing in any other report that we know of: Part of the stock
capital is there designated as “fair market value of warrants issued
in connection with acquisition, etc., $22,129,000.”

What on earth do all these entries mean? None of them is even
referred  to  in  the  descriptive  text  of  the  1969  report.  The  trained
security  analyst  has  to  figure  out  these  mysteries  by  himself,
almost in detective fashion. He finds that the underlying idea is to
derive a tax advantage from the low initial price of the 5% deben-
tures. For readers who may be interested in this ingenious arrange-
ment we set forth our solution in Appendix 6.

Other Unusual Items

1.  Right  after  the  close  of  1969  the  company  bought  in  no  less
than 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. This was extraordi-
nary  when  we  consider  that  (a)  NVF  itself  had  only  $700,000  in
cash at the year-end, and had $4,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evi-
dently the $6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed); (b)
it was buying in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5%
bonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar—ordinarily a
warning that financial difficulties lay ahead.

2. As a partial offset to this, the company had retired $5,100,000
of  its  bonds  along  with  253,000  warrants  in  exchange  for  a  like
amount  of  common  stock.  This  was  possible  because,  by  the
vagaries  of  the  securities  markets,  people  were  selling  the  5%
bonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of
131⁄2, paying no dividend.

3. The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock
to its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of war-
rants to buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were
to be paid for 5% down and the rest over many years in the future.
This is the only such employee-purchase plan for warrants that we
know of. Will someone soon invent and sell on installments a right
to buy a right to buy a share, and so on?

4.  In  the  year  1969  the  newly  controlled  Sharon  Steel  Co.
changed  its  method  of  arriving  at  its  pension  costs,  and  also

Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories

433

adopted lower depreciation rates. These accounting changes added
about $1 per share to the reported earnings of NVF before dilution.

5. At the end of 1970 Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide reported that
NVF shares were selling at a price/earning ratio of only 2, the lowest
figure for all the 4,500-odd issues in the booklet. As the old Wall Street
saying went, this was “important if true.” The ratio was based on the
year’s closing price of 83⁄4 and the computed “earnings” of $5.38 per
share for the 12 months ended September 1970. (Using these figures
the shares were selling at only 1.6 times earnings.) But this ratio did
not  allow  for  the  large  dilution  factor,*  nor  for  the  adverse  results
actually realized in the last quarter of 1970. When the full year’s fig-
ures finally appeared, they showed only $2.03 per share earned for
the  stock,  before  allowing  for  dilution,  and  $1.80  per  share  on  a
diluted basis. Note also that the aggregate market price of the stock
and warrants on that date was about $14 million against a bonded
debt of $135 million—a skimpy equity position indeed.

AAA Enterprises

History

About  15  years  ago  a  college  student  named  Williams  began
selling mobile homes (then called “trailers”).† In 1965 he incorpo-

* The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees exer-
cised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then have to
issue  more  shares,  and  its  net  earnings  would  be  divided  across  a  much
greater number of shares outstanding.
† Jackie G. Williams founded AAA Enterprises in 1958. On its first day of trad-
ing, the stock soared 56% to close at $20.25. Williams later announced that
AAA would come up with a new franchising concept every month (if people
would step into a mobile home to get their income taxes done by “Mr. Tax of
America,” just imagine what else they might do inside a trailer!). But AAA ran
out of time and money before Williams ran out of ideas. The history of AAA
Enterprises is reminiscent of the saga of a later company with charismatic man-
agement  and  scanty  assets:  ZZZZ  Best  achieved  a  stock-market  value  of
roughly $200 million in the late 1980s, even though its purported industrial
vacuum-cleaning business was little more than a telephone and a rented office
run by a teenager named Barry Minkow. ZZZZ Best went bust and Minkow

434

The Intelligent Investor

rated his business. In that year he sold $5,800,000 of mobile homes
and earned $61,000 before corporate tax. By 1968 he had joined the
“franchising”  movement  and  was  selling  others  the  right  to  sell
mobile  homes  under  his  business  name.  He  also  conceived  the
bright  idea  of  going  into  the  business  of  preparing  income-tax
returns, using his mobile homes as offices. He formed a subsidiary
company  called  Mr.  Tax  of America,  and  of  course  started  to  sell
franchises  to  others  to  use  the  idea  and  the  name.  He  multiplied
the  number  of  corporate  shares  to  2,710,000  and  was  ready  for  a
stock  offering.  He  found  that  one  of  our  largest  stock-exchange
houses, along with others, was willing to handle the deal. In March
1969 they offered the public 500,000 shares of AAA Enterprises at
$13 per share. Of these, 300,000 were sold for Mr. Williams’s per-
sonal  account  and  200,000  were  sold  for  the  company  account,
adding $2,400,000 to its resources. The price of the stock promptly
doubled  to  28,  or  a  value  of  $84  million  for  the  equity,  against  a
book value of, say, $4,200,000 and maximum reported earnings of
$690,000. The stock was thus selling at a tidy 115 times its current
(and  largest)  earnings  per  share.  No  doubt  Mr.  Williams  had
selected  the  name AAA Enterprise  so  that  it  might  be  among  the
first  in  the  phone  books  and  the  yellow  pages. A collateral  result
was that his company was destined to appear as the first name in
Standard  &  Poor’s  Stock  Guide. Like Abu-Ben-Adhem’s,  it  led  all
the  rest.*  This  gives  a  special  reason  to  select  it  as  a  harrowing
example of 1969 new financing and “hot issues.”

Comment:  This  was  not  a  bad  deal  for  Mr.  Williams.  The
300,000  shares  he  sold  had  a  book  value  in  December  of  1968  of
$180,000  and  he  netted  therefor  20  times  as  much,  or  a  cool
$3,600,000.  The  underwriters  and  distributors  split  $500,000
between them, less expenses.

went to jail. Even as you read this, another similar company is being formed,
and a new generation of “investors” will be taken for a ride. No one who has
read Graham, however, should climb on board.
* In  “Abou  Ben  Adhem,”  by  the  British  Romantic  poet  Leigh  Hunt
(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book
“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that his
name is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as one that
loves  his  fellow  men.”  The  angel  returns  the  next  night  to  show  Abou  the
book, in which now “Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest.”

1. This did not seem so brilliant a deal for the clients of the sell-
ing houses. They were asked to pay about ten times the book value
of the stock, after the bootstrap operation of increasing their equity
per share from 59 cents to $1.35 with their own money.* Before the
best  year  1968,  the  company’s  maximum  earnings  had  been  a
ridiculous  7  cents  per  share.  There  were  ambitious  plans  for  the
future, of course—but the public was being asked to pay heavily in
advance for the hoped-for realization of these plans.

2. Nonetheless, the price of the stock doubled soon after original
issuance,  and  any  one  of  the  brokerage-house  clients  could  have
gotten out at a handsome profit. Did this fact alter the flotation, or
did  the  advance  possibility  that  it  might  happen  exonerate  the
original distributors of the issue from responsibility for this public
offering and its later sequel? Not an easy question to answer, but it
deserves careful consideration by Wall Street and the government
regulatory agencies.†

Subsequent History

With  its  enlarged  capital  AAA Enterprises  went  into  two  addi-
tional businesses. In 1969 it opened a chain of retail carpet stores, and
it  acquired  a  plant  that  manufactured  mobile  homes.  The  results
reported for the first nine months were not exactly brilliant, but they
were a little better than the year before—22 cents a share against 14

* By  purchasing  more  common  stock  at  a  premium  to  its  book  value,  the
investing public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But investors
were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since most of the
rise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own willingness to over-
pay for the stock.
† Graham’s point is that investment banks are not entitled to take credit for
the gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial public offering unless
they  are  also  willing  to  take  the  blame  for  the  stock’s  performance  in  the
longer  term.  Many  Internet  IPOs  rose  1,000%  or  more  in  1999  and  early
2000;  most  of  them  lost  more  than  95%  in  the  subsequent  three  years.
How could these early gains earned by a few investors justify the massive
destruction of wealth suffered by the millions who came later? Many IPOs
were,  in  fact,  deliberately  underpriced  to  “manufacture”  immediate  gains
that would attract more attention for the next offering.

436

The Intelligent Investor

cents.  What  happened  in  the  next  months  was  literally  incredible.
The company lost $4,365,000, or $1.49 per share. This consumed all its
capital before the financing, plus the entire $2,400,000 received on the
sale of stock plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the
first nine months of 1969. There was left a pathetic $242,000, or 8 cents
per share, of capital for the public shareholders who had paid $13 for
the new offering only seven months before. Nonetheless the shares
closed the year 1969 at 81⁄8 bid, or a “valuation” of more than $25 mil-
lion for the company.

Further Comment: 1. It is too much to believe that the company
had actually earned $686,000 from January to September 1969 and
then lost $4,365,000 in the next three months. There was something
sadly, badly, and accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.

2. The year’s closing price of 81⁄8 bid was even more of a demon-
stration  of  the  complete  heedlessness  of  stock-market  prices  than
were the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent “hot-issue”
advance  to  a  high  bid  of  28.  These  latter  quotations  at  least  were
based on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and
common sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation
of $25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus-
cule remnant of its capital, for which a completely insolvent condi-
tion was imminent, and for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope”
would be only bitter sarcasms. (It is true the year-end figures had not
been published by December 31, but it is the business of Wall Street
houses associated with a company to have monthly operating state-
ments and a fairly exact idea of how things are going.)

Final Chapter

For the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of
$1 million. It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out
of  bankruptcy  by  loans  made  by  Mr.  Williams,  up  to  a  total  of
$2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until
in  January  1971 AAA Enterprises  finally  filed  a  petition  in  bank-
ruptcy. The quotation for the stock at month-end was still 50 cents
a share bid, or $1,500,000 for the entire issue, which evidently had
no more than wallpaper value. End of our story.

Moral and Questions: The speculative public is incorrigible. In

Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories

financial terms it cannot count beyond 3. It will buy anything, at any
price, if there seems to be some “action” in progress. It will fall for
any company identified with “franchising,” computers, electronics,
science, technology, or what have you, when the particular fashion is
raging. Our readers, sensible investors all, are of course above such
foolishness.  But  questions  remain:  Should  not  responsible  invest-
ment houses be honor-bound to refrain from identifying themselves
with such enterprises, nine out of ten of which may be foredoomed to
ultimate  failure?  (This  was  actually  the  situation  when  the  author
entered Wall Street in 1914. By comparison it would seem that the
ethical standards of the “Street” have fallen rather than advanced in
the  ensuing  57  years,  despite  all  the  reforms  and  all  the  controls.)
Could and should the SEC be given other powers to protect the pub-
lic, beyond the present ones which are limited to requiring the print-
ing of all important relevant facts in the offering prospectus? Should
some kind of box score for public offerings of various types be com-
piled and published in conspicuous fashion? Should every prospec-
tus,  and  perhaps  every  confirmation  of  sale  under  an  original
offering, carry some kind of formal warranty that the offering price
for the issue is not substantially out of line with the ruling prices for
issues of the same general type already established in the market? As
we  write  this  edition  a  movement  toward  reform  of  Wall  Street
abuses  is  under  way.  It  will  be  difficult  to  impose  worthwhile
changes  in  the  field  of  new  offerings,  because  the  abuses  are  so
largely the result of the public’s own heedlessness and greed. But the
matter deserves long and careful consideration.*

* The first four sentences of Graham’s paragraph could read as the official
epitaph  of  the  Internet  and  telecommunications  bubble  that  burst  in  early
2000.  Just  as  the  Surgeon  General’s  warning  on  the  side  of  a  cigarette
pack does not stop everyone from lighting up, no regulatory reform will ever
prevent investors from overdosing on their own greed. (Not even Commu-
nism can outlaw market bubbles; the Chinese stock market shot up 101.7%
in the first half of 1999, then crashed.) Nor can investment banks ever be
entirely cleansed of their own compulsion to sell any stock at any price the
market will bear. The circle can only be broken one investor, and one finan-
cial adviser, at a time. Mastering Graham’s principles (see especially Chap-
ters 1, 8, and 20) is the best way to start.

A closer reading of Lucent’s report sets alarm bells jangling like an

unanswered telephone switchboard:

•

•

•

Lucent had just bought an optical equipment supplier, Chromatis
Networks, for $4.8 billion—of which $4.2 billion was “goodwill” (or
cost above book value). Chromatis had 150 employees, no cus-
tomers, and zero revenues, so the term “goodwill” seems inade-
quate;  perhaps  “hope  chest”  is  more  accurate.  If  Chromatis’s
embryonic  products  did  not  work  out,  Lucent  would  have  to
reverse the goodwill and charge it off against future earnings.
A footnote  discloses  that  Lucent  had  lent  $1.5  billion  to  pur-
chasers  of  its  products.  Lucent  was  also  on  the  hook  for  $350
million in guarantees for money its customers had borrowed else-
where. The total of these “customer financings” had doubled in a
year—suggesting that purchasers were running out of cash to buy
Lucent’s  products.  What  if  they  ran  out  of  cash  to  pay  their
debts?
Finally, Lucent treated the cost of developing new software as a
“capital  asset.”  Rather  than  an  asset,  wasn’t  that  a  routine  busi-
ness expense that should come out of earnings?

Commentary on Chapter 17

CONCLUSION: In August 2001, Lucent shut down the Chromatis
division after its products reportedly attracted only two customers.2 In
fiscal year 2001, Lucent lost $16.2 billion; in fiscal year 2002, it lost
another  $11.9  billion.  Included  in  those  losses  were  $3.5  billion  in
“provisions  for  bad  debts  and  customer  financings,”  $4.1  billion  in
“impairment charges related to goodwill,” and $362 million in charges
“related to capitalized software.”

Lucent’s  stock,  at  $51.062  on  June  30,  2000,  finished  2002  at
$1.26—a loss of nearly $190 billion in market value in two-and-a-half
years.

T H E   A C Q U I S I T I O N   M A G I C I A N

To describe  Tyco  International  Ltd.,  we  can  only  paraphrase  Winston
Churchill and say that never has so much been sold by so many to so
few. From 1997 through 2001, this Bermuda-based conglomerate spent
a total of more than $37 billion—most of it in shares of Tyco stock—buying
companies  the  way  Imelda  Marcos  bought  shoes.  In  fiscal  year  2000
alone, according to its annual report, Tyco acquired “approximately 200
companies”—an average of more than one every other day.

The  result?  Tyco  grew  phenomenally  fast;  in  five  years,  revenues
went from $7.6 billion to $34 billion, and operating income shot from a
$476 million loss to a $6.2 billion gain. No wonder the company had a
total stock-market value of $114 billion at the end of 2001.

But Tyco’s financial statements were at least as mind-boggling as
its growth. Nearly every year, they featured hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in acquisition-related charges. These expenses fell into three main
categories:

1) “merger” or “restructuring” or “other nonrecurring” costs,
2) “charges for the impairment of long-lived assets,” and

For  the  sake  of  brevity,  let’s  refer  to  the  first  kind  of  charge  as
MORON, the second as CHILLA, and the third as WOOPIPRAD. How
did they show up over time?

As you can see, the MORON charges—which are supposed to be
nonrecurring—showed up in four out of five years and totaled a whopping
$2.5  billion.  CHILLA  cropped  up  just  as  chronically  and  amounted  to
more than $700 million. WOOPIPRAD came to another half-billion dol-
lars.3

The intelligent investor would ask:

•

•

•

If Tyco’s strategy of growth-through-acquisition was such a neat
idea, how come it had to spend an average of $750 million a year
cleaning up after itself?
If, as seems clear, Tyco was not in the business of making things—
but  rather  in  the  business  of  buying  other  companies  that  make
things—then  why  were  its  MORON  charges  “nonrecurring”?
Weren’t they just part of Tyco’s normal costs of doing business?
And with accounting charges for past acquisitions junking up every
year’s earnings, who could tell what next year’s would be?

3 When accounting for acquisitions, loading up on WOOPIPRAD enabled
Tyco to reduce the portion of the purchase price that it allocated to goodwill.
Since WOOPIPRAD can be expensed up front, while goodwill (under the
accounting rules then in force) had to be written off over multi-year periods,
this maneuver enabled Tyco to minimize the impact of goodwill charges on
its future earnings.

Commentary on Chapter 17

In  fact,  an  investor  couldn’t  even  tell  what  Tyco’s  past earnings
were. In 1999, after an accounting review by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange  Commission,  Tyco  retroactively  added  $257  million  in
MORON charges to its 1998 expenses—meaning that those “nonre-
curring” costs had actually recurred in that year, too. At the same time,
the  company  rejiggered 
its  originally  reported  1999  charges:
MORON dropped to $929 million while CHILLA rose to $507 million.
Tyco  was  clearly  growing  in  size,  but  was  it  growing  more  prof-

itable? No outsider could safely tell.

CONCLUSION:  In  fiscal  year  2002,  Tyco  lost  $9.4  billion.  The
stock, which had closed at $58.90 at year-end 2001, finished 2002 at
$17.08—a loss of 71% in twelve months.4

A   M I N N O W   S W A L L O W S   A   W H A L E

On  January  10,  2000,  America  Online,  Inc.  and  Time  Warner  Inc.
announced  that  they  would  merge  in  a  deal  initially  valued  at  $156 
billion.

As of December 31, 1999, AOL had $10.3 billion in assets, and its
revenues over the previous 12 months had amounted to $5.7 billion.
Time Warner, on the other hand, had $51.2 billion in assets and rev-
enues of $27.3 billion. Time Warner was a vastly bigger company by
any measure except one: the valuation of its stock. Because America
Online bedazzled investors simply by being in the Internet industry, its
stock  sold  for  a  stupendous  164  times  its  earnings.  Stock  in  Time
Warner, a grab bag of cable television, movies, music, and magazines,
sold for around 50 times earnings.

In  announcing  the  deal,  the  two  companies  called  it  a  “strategic
merger of equals.” Time Warner’s chairman, Gerald M. Levin, declared
that  “the  opportunities  are  limitless  for  everyone  connected  to  AOL
Time Warner”—above all, he added, for its shareholders.

Ecstatic that their stock might finally get the cachet of an Internet

4 In 2002, Tyco’s former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, was charged
by state and Federal legal authorities with income tax fraud and improperly
diverting Tyco’s corporate assets for his own use, including the appropria-
tion  of  $15,000  for  an  umbrella  stand  and  $6,000  for  a  shower  curtain.
Kozlowski denied all charges.

darling, Time Warner shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal.
But they overlooked a few things:

•

•

•

This  “merger  of  equals”  was  designed  to  give  America  Online’s
shareholders 55% of the combined company—even though Time
Warner was five times bigger.
For  the  second  time  in  three  years,  the  U.S.  Securities  and
Exchange Commission was investigating whether America Online
had improperly accounted for marketing costs.
Nearly  half  of  America  Online’s  total  assets—$4.9  billion  worth—
was made up of “available-for-sale equity securities.” If the prices
of  publicly-traded  technology  stocks  fell,  that  could  wipe  out
much of the company’s asset base.

CONCLUSION: On January 11, 2001, the two firms finalized their
merger.  AOL  Time  Warner  Inc.  lost  $4.9  billion  in  2001  and—in  the
most gargantuan loss ever recorded by a corporation—another $98.7
billion in 2002. Most of the losses came from writing down the value
of  America  Online.  By  year-end  2002,  the  shareholders  for  whom
Levin  predicted  “unlimited”  opportunities  had  nothing  to  show  but  a
roughly 80% loss in the value of their shares since the deal was first
announced.5

On May 20, 1999, eToys Inc. sold 8% of its stock to the public. Four
of Wall Street’s most prestigious investment banks—Goldman, Sachs
&  Co.;  BancBoston  Robertson  Stephens;  Donaldson,  Lufkin  &  Jen-
rette; and Merrill Lynch & Co.—underwrote 8,320,000 shares at $20
apiece,  raising  $166.4  million.  The  stock  roared  up,  closing  at
$76.5625,  a  282.8%  gain  in  its  first  day  of  trading.  At  that  price,
eToys (with its 102 million shares) had a market value of $7.8 billion.6

Commentary on Chapter 17

What kind of business did buyers get for that price? eToys’ sales
had risen 4,261% in the previous year, and it had added 75,000 cus-
tomers  in  the  last  quarter  alone.  But,  in  its  20  months  in  business,
eToys had produced total sales of $30.6 million, on which it had run a
net loss of $30.8 million—meaning that eToys was spending $2 to sell
every dollar’s worth of toys.

The  IPO  prospectus  also  disclosed  that  eToys  would  use  some
proceeds  of  the  offering  to  acquire  another  online  operation,  Baby-
Center, Inc., which had lost $4.5 million on $4.8 million in sales over
the previous year. (To land this prize, eToys would pay a mere $205
million.)  And  eToys  would  “reserve”  40.6  million  shares  of  common
stock for future issuance to its management. So, if eToys ever made
money, its net income would have to be divided not among 102 million
shares, but among 143 million—diluting any future earnings per share
by nearly one-third.

A  comparison  of  eToys  with  Toys  “R”  Us,  Inc.—its  biggest  rival—is
shocking. In the preceding three months, Toys “R” Us had earned $27
million  in  net  income  and  had  sold  over  70  times  more  goods  than
eToys had sold in an entire year. And yet as Figure 17-3 shows, the
stock market valued eToys at nearly $2 billion more than Toys “R” Us.
CONCLUSION: On March 7, 2001, eToys filed for bankruptcy pro-
tection  after  racking  up  net  losses  of  more  than  $398  million  in  its
brief  life  as  a  public  company.  The  stock,  which  peaked  at  $86  per
share in October 1999, last traded for a penny.

Gail Bronson of IPO Monitor told the Associated Press on the day of eToys’
stock  offering,  “eToys  has  very,  very  smartly  managed  the  development  of
the company last year and positioned themselves to be the children’s center
of the Internet.” Added Bronson: “The key to a successful IPO, especially a
dot-com  IPO,  is  good  marketing  and  branding.”  Bronson  was  partly  right:
That’s the key to a successful IPO for the issuing company and its bankers.
Unfortunately, for investors the key to a successful IPO is earnings, which
eToys didn’t have.

CHAPTER 18

A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

In  this  chapter  we  shall  attempt  a  novel  form  of  exposition.  By
selecting eight pairs of companies which appear next to each other,
or nearly so, on the stock-exchange list we hope to bring home in a
concrete and vivid manner some of the many varieties of character,
financial  structure,  policies,  performance,  and  vicissitudes  of  cor-
porate enterprises, and of the investment and speculative attitudes
found on the financial scene in recent years. In each comparison we
shall comment only on those aspects that have a special meaning
and import.

Pair I: Real Estate Investment Trust (stores, offices, factories,
etc.) and Realty Equities Corp. of New York (real estate
investment; general construction)

In  this  first  comparison  we  depart  from  the  alphabetical  order
used for the other pairs. It has a special significance for us, since it
seems  to  encapsulate,  on  the  one  hand,  all  that  has  been  reason-
able,  stable,  and  generally  good  in  the  traditional  methods  of 
handling  other  people’s  money,  in  contrast—in  the  other  com-
pany—with the reckless expansion, the financial legerdemain, and
the roller-coaster changes so often found in present-day corporate
operations. The two enterprises have similar names, and for many
years they appeared side by side on the American Stock Exchange
list. Their stock-ticker symbols—REI and REC—could easily have
been  confused.  But  one  of  them  is  a  staid  New  England  trust,
administered by three trustees, with operations dating back nearly
a century, and with dividends paid continuously since 1889. It has
kept throughout to the same type of prudent investments, limiting

its expansion to a moderate rate and its debt to an easily manage-
able figure.*

The other is a typical New York-based sudden-growth venture,
which  in  eight  years  blew  up  its  assets  from  $6.2  million  to  $154
million,  and  its  debts  in  the  same  proportion;  which  moved  out
from  ordinary  real-estate  operations  to  a  miscellany  of  ventures,
including two racetracks, 74 movie theaters, three literary agencies,
a public-relations firm, hotels, supermarkets, and a 26% interest in
a  large  cosmetics  firm  (which  went  bankrupt  in  1970).†  This  con-
glomeration of business ventures was matched by a corresponding
variety of corporate devices, including the following:

1. A preferred  stock  entitled  to  $7  annual  dividends,  but  with  a
par value of only $1, and carried as a liability at $1 per share.
2. A stated  common-stock  value  of  $2,500,000  ($1  per  share),
more  than  offset  by  a  deduction  of  $5,500,000  as  the  cost  of
209,000 shares of reacquired stock.

3. Three  series  of  stock-option  warrants,  giving  rights  to  buy  a

total of 1,578,000 shares.

4. At least six different kinds of debt obligations, in the form of
mortgages,  debentures,  publicly  held  notes,  notes  payable  to
banks,  “notes,  loans,  and  contracts  payable,”  and  loans
payable  to  the  Small  Business  Administration,  adding  up  to
over $100 million in March 1969. In addition it had the usual
taxes and accounts payable.

Let us present first a few figures of the two enterprises as they
appeared in 1960 (Table 18-1A). Here we find the Trust shares sell-
ing  in  the  market  for  nine  times  the  aggregate  value  of  Equities
stock. The Trust enterprise had a smaller relative debt and a better

ratio  of  net  to  gross,  but  the  price  of  the  common  was  higher  in
relation to per-share earnings.

In Table 18-1B we present the situation about eight years later.
The Trust had “kept the noiseless tenor of its way,” increasing both
its  revenues  and  its  per-share  earnings  by  about  three-quarters.*
But Realty Equities had been metamorphosed into something mon-
strous and vulnerable.

How  did  Wall  Street  react  to  these  diverse  developments?  By
paying as little attention as possible to the Trust and a lot to Realty
Equities.  In  1968  the  latter  shot  up  from  10  to  373⁄4 and  the  listed
warrants  from  6  to  361⁄2,  on  combined  sales  of  2,420,000  shares.
While this was happening the Trust shares advanced sedately from
20  to  301⁄4 on  modest  volume.  The  March  1969  balance  sheet  of
Equities  was  to  show  an  asset  value  of  only  $3.41  per  share,  less
than a tenth of its high price that year. The book value of the Trust
shares was $20.85.

in a Country Churchyard.”

The Intelligent Investor

The next year it became clear that all was not well in the Equities
picture,  and  the  price  fell  to  91⁄2.  When  the  report  for  March  1970
appeared  the  shareholders  must  have  felt  shell-shocked  as  they
read that the enterprise had sustained a net loss of $13,200,000, or
$5.17  per  share—virtually  wiping  out  their  former  slim  equity.
(This  disastrous  figure  included  a  reserve  of  $8,800,000  for  future
losses  on  investments.)  Nonetheless  the  directors  had  bravely  (?)
declared an extra dividend of 5 cents right after the close of the fis-
cal  year.  But  more  trouble  was  in  sight.  The  company’s  auditors
refused  to  certify  the  financial  statements  for  1969–70,  and  the
shares  were  suspended  from  trading  on  the  American  Stock
Exchange.  In  the  over-the-counter  market  the  bid  price  dropped
below $2 per share.*

Real Estate Investment Trust shares had typical price fluctuations
after 1969. The low in 1970 was 161⁄2, with a recovery to 265⁄6 in early
1971. The latest reported earnings were $1.50 per share, and the stock
was selling moderately above its 1970 book value of $21.60. The issue
may have been somewhat overpriced at its record high in 1968, but the
shareholders  have  been  honestly  and  well  served  by  their  trustees.
The Real Estate Equities story is a different and a sorry one.

Pair 2: Air Products and Chemicals (industrial and medical
gases, etc.) and Air Reduction Co. (industrial gases and
equipment; chemicals)

Even more than our first pair, these two resemble each other in
both name and line of business. The comparison they invite is thus
of  the  conventional  type  in  security  analysis,  while  most  of  our
other pairs are more heteroclite in nature.† “Products” is a newer

* Realty Equities was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in Sep-
tember 1973. In 1974, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued
Realty Equities’ accountants for fraud. Realty Equities’ founder, Morris Karp,
later  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of  grand  larceny.  In  1974–1975,  the
overindebtedness that Graham criticizes led to a financial crisis among large
banks, including Chase Manhattan, that had lent heavily to the most aggres-
sive realty trusts.
† “Heteroclite” is a technical term from classical Greek that Graham uses to
mean abnormal or unusual.

451

company  than  “Reduction,”  and  in  1969  had  less  than  half  the
other’s volume.* Nonetheless its equity issues sold for 25% more in
the aggregate than Air Reduction’s stock. As Table 18-2 shows, the
reason  can  be  found  both  in Air  Reduction’s  greater  profitability
and in its stronger growth record. We find here the typical conse-
quences of a better showing of “quality.” Air Products sold at 161⁄2
times  its  latest  earnings  against  only  9.1  times  for Air  Reduction.
Also  Air  Products  sold  well  above  its  asset  backing,  while  Air
Reduction  could  be  bought  at  only  75%  of  its  book  value.†  Air
Reduction paid a more liberal dividend; but this may be deemed to
reflect  the  greater  desirability  for  Air  Products  to  retain  its  earn-
ings. Also, Air Reduction had a more comfortable working-capital
position. (On this point we may remark that a profitable company
can always put its current position in shape by some form of per-
manent  financing.  But  by  our  standards Air  Products  was  some-
what overbonded.)

If the analyst were called on to choose between the two compa-
nies he would have no difficulty in concluding that the prospects
of Air  Products  looked  more  promising  than  those  of Air  Reduc-
tion. But did this make Air Products more attractive at its consider-
ably higher relative price? We doubt whether this question can be
answered in a definitive fashion. In general Wall Street sets “qual-
ity” above “quantity” in its thinking, and probably the majority of
security  analysts  would  opt  for  the  “better”  but  dearer Air  Prod-
ucts  as  against  the  “poorer”  but  cheaper Air  Reduction.  Whether
this preference is to prove right or wrong is more likely to depend
on the unpredictable future than on any demonstrable investment
principle. In this instance, Air Reduction appears to belong to the
group of important companies in the low-multiplier class. If, as the
studies referred to above†† would seem to indicate, that group as a

* By  “volume,”  Graham  is  referring  to  sales  or  revenues—the  total  dollar
amount of each company’s business.
† “Asset backing” and book value are synonyms. In Table 18-2, the relation-
ship  of  price  to  asset  or  book  value  can  be  seen  by  dividing  the  first  line
(“Price, December 31, 1969”) by “Book value per share.”
†† Graham is citing his research on value stocks, which he discusses in Chap-
ter 15 (see p. 389). Since Graham completed his studies, a vast body of
scholarly work has confirmed that value stocks outperform (cont’d on p. 453)

whole is  likely  to  give  a  better  account  of  itself  than  the  high-
multiplier stocks, then Air Reduction should logically be given the
preference—but  only  as  part  of  a  diversified  operation.  (Also,  a
thorough-going study of the individual companies could lead the
analyst  to  the  opposite  conclusion;  but  that  would  have  to  be  for
reasons beyond those already reflected in the past showing.)

These were two “billion-dollar good-will” companies at the end
of  1969,  representing  different  segments  of  the  rapidly  growing
and immensely profitable “health industry.” We shall refer to them
as Home and Hospital, respectively. Selected data on both are pre-
sented  in  Table  18-3.  They  had  the  following  favorable  points  in
common: excellent growth, with no setbacks since 1958 (i.e., 100%
earnings stability); and strong financial condition. The growth rate
of  Hospital  up  to  the  end  of  1969  was  considerably  higher  than
Home’s.  On  the  other  hand,  Home  enjoyed  substantially  better
profitability on both sales and capital.† (In fact, the relatively low
rate of Hospital’s earnings on its capital in 1969—only 9.7%—raises
the  intriguing  question  whether  the  business  then  was  in  fact  a
highly  profitable  one,  despite  its  remarkable  past  growth  rate  in
sales and earnings.)

When  comparative  price  is  taken  into  account,  Home  offered

(cont’d  from  p.  451) growth  stocks  over  long  periods.  (Much  of  the  best
research  in  modern  finance  simply  provides  independent  confirmation  of
what  Graham  demonstrated  decades  ago.)  See,  for  instance,  James  L.
Davis,  Eugene  F.  Fama,  and  Kenneth  R.  French,  “Characteristics,  Covari-
ances, and Average Returns: 1929–1997,” at http://papers.ssrn.com.
* Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., still exists as a publicly-traded stock and
is  included  in  the  Standard  &  Poor’s  500-stock  index.  Air  Reduction  Co.
became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  The  BOC  Group  (then  known  as
British Oxygen) in 1978.
† You can determine profitability, as measured by return on sales and return
on capital, by referring to the “Ratios” section of Table 18-3. “Net/sales” mea-
sures return on sales; “Earnings/book value” measures return on capital.

much  more  for  the  money  in  terms  of  current  (or  past)  earnings
and dividends. The very low book value of Home illustrates a basic
ambiguity or contradiction in common-stock analysis. On the one
hand,  it  means  that  the  company  is  earning  a  high  return  on  its
capital—which in general is a sign of strength and prosperity. On
the other, it means that the investor at the current price would be
especially  vulnerable  to  any  important  adverse  change  in  the
company’s  earnings  situation.  Since  Hospital  was  selling  at  over
four times its book value in 1969, this cautionary remark must be
applied to both companies.

A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

455

CONCLUSIONS: Our clear-cut view would be that both companies
were  too  “rich”  at  their  current  prices  to  be  considered  by  the
investor who decides to follow our ideas of conservative selection.
This  does  not  mean  that  the  companies  were  lacking  in  promise.
The trouble is, rather, that their price contained too much “prom-
ise”  and  not  enough  actual  performance.  For  the  two  enterprises
combined,  the  1969  price  reflected  almost  $5  billion  of  good-will
valuation.  How  many  years  of  excellent  future  earnings  would  it
take to “realize” that good-will factor in the form of dividends or
tangible assets?

SHORT-TERM SEQUEL:  At  the  end  of  1969  the  market  evidently
thought more highly of the earnings prospects of Hospital than of
Home, since it gave the former almost twice the multiplier of the
latter.  As  it  happened  the  favored  issue  showed  a  microscopic
decline in earnings in 1970, while Home turned in a respectable 8%
gain. The market price of Hospital reacted significantly to this one-
year  disappointment.  It  sold  at  32  in  February  1971—a  loss  of
about  30%  from  its  1969  close—while  Home  was  quoted  slightly
above its corresponding level.*

Pair 4: H & R Block, Inc. (income-tax service) and Blue Bell,
Inc., (manufacturers of work clothes, uniforms, etc.)

These  companies  rub  shoulders  as  relative  newcomers  to  the
New York Stock Exchange, where they represent two very different
genres  of  success  stories.  Blue  Bell  came  up  the  hard  way  in  a
highly  competitive  industry,  in  which  eventually  it  became  the
largest factor. Its earnings have fluctuated somewhat with industry
conditions,  but  their  growth  since  1965  has  been  impressive.  The
company’s operations go back to 1916 and its continuous dividend
record  to  1923.  At  the  end  of  1969  the  stock  market  showed  no
enthusiasm for the issue, giving it a price/earnings ratio of only 11,
against about 17 for the S & P composite index.

By contrast, the rise of H & R Block has been meteoric. Its first

included in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. American Hospital Sup-

published figures date only to 1961, in which year it earned $83,000
on revenues of $610,000. But eight years later, on our comparison
date,  its  revenues  had  soared  to  $53.6  million  and  its  net  to  $6.3
million. At  that  time  the  stock  market’s  attitude  toward  this  fine
performer  appeared  nothing  less  than  ecstatic.  The  price  of  55  at
the  close  of  1969  was  more  than  100  times  the  last  reported  12-
months’  earnings—which  of  course  were  the  largest  to  date.  The
aggregate  market  value  of  $300  million  for  the  stock  issue  was
nearly  30  times  the  tangible  assets  behind  the  shares.*  This  was
almost unheard of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations.
(At  that  time  IBM  was  selling  at  about  9  times  and  Xerox  at  11
times book value.)

Our  Table  18-4  sets  forth  in  dollar  figures  and  in  ratios  the
extraordinary discrepancy in the comparative valuations of Block
and  Blue  Bell.  True,  Block  showed  twice  the  profitability  of  Blue
Bell  per  dollar  of  capital,  and  its  percentage  growth  in  earnings
over  the  past  five  years  (from  practically  nothing)  was  much
higher. But as a stock enterprise Blue Bell was selling for less than
one-third  the  total  value  of  Block,  although  Blue  Bell  was  doing
four  times  as  much  business,  earning  21⁄2 times  as  much  for  its
stock, had 51⁄2 times as much in tangible investment, and gave nine
times the dividend yield on the price.

INDICATED CONCLUSIONS:  An  experienced  analyst  would  have
conceded great momentum to Block, implying excellent prospects
for future growth. He might have had some qualms about the dan-
gers of serious competition in the income-tax-service field, lured by
the handsome return on capital realized by Block.1 But mindful of
the  continued  success  of  such  outstanding  companies  as  Avon
Products  in  highly  competitive  areas,  he  would  have  hesitated  to
predict a speedy flattening out of the Block growth curve. His chief

* “Nearly  30  times”  is  reflected  in  the  entry  of  2920%  under  “Price/book
value” in the Ratios section of Table 18-4. Graham would have shaken his
head  in  astonishment  during  late  1999  and  early  2000,  when  many  high-
tech companies sold for hundreds of times their asset value (see the com-
mentary  on  this  chapter).  Talk  about  “almost  unheard  of  in  the  annals  of
serious  stock-market  valuations”!  H  &  R  Block  remains  a  publicly-traded
company, while Blue Bell was taken private in 1984 at $47.50 per share.

concern  would  be  simply  whether  the  $300  million  valuation  for
the company had not already fully valued and perhaps overvalued
all  that  one  could  reasonably  expect  from  this  excellent  business.
By contrast the analyst should have had little difficulty in recom-
mending Blue Bell as a fine company, quite conservatively priced.

SEQUEL TO MARCH 1971. The 1970 near-panic lopped one-quarter
off  the  price  of  Blue  Bell  and  about  one-third  from  that  of  Block.
Both then joined in the extraordinary recovery of the general mar-

ket.  The  price  of  Block  rose  to  75  in  February  1971,  but  Blue  Bell
advanced  considerably  more—to  the  equivalent  of  109  (after  a
three-for-two  split).  Clearly  Blue  Bell  proved  a  better  buy  than
Block  as  of  the  end  of  1969.  But  the  fact  that  Block  was  able  to
advance  some  35%  from  that  apparently  inflated  value  indicates
how wary analysts and investors must be to sell good companies
short—either by word or deed—no matter how high the quotation
may seem.*

Pair 5: International Flavors & Fragrances (flavors, etc., for
other businesses) and International Harvester Co. (truck
manufacturer, farm machinery, construction machinery)

This comparison should carry more than one surprise. Everyone
knows of International Harvester, one of the 30 giants in the Dow
Jones  Industrial  Average.†  How  many  of  our  readers  have  even
heard of International Flavors & Fragrances, next-door neighbor to
Harvester on the New York Stock Exchange list? Yet, mirabile dictu,
IFF was actually selling at the end of 1969 for a higher aggregate
market  value  than  Harvester—$747  million  versus  $710  million.
This is the more amazing when one reflects that Harvester had 17
times the stock capital of Flavors and 27 times the annual sales. In

* Graham  is  alerting  readers  to  a  form  of  the  “gambler’s  fallacy,”  in  which
investors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price purely because
it is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more likely to turn up heads
after landing on tails for nine times in a row, so an overvalued stock (or stock
market!) can stay overvalued for a surprisingly long time. That makes short-
selling, or betting that stocks will drop, too risky for mere mortals.
† International  Harvester  was  the  heir  to  McCormick  Harvesting  Machine
Co., the manufacturer of the McCormick reaper that helped make the mid-
western  states  the  “breadbasket  of  the  world.”  But  International  Harvester
fell on hard times in the 1970s and, in 1985, sold its farm-equipment busi-
ness to Tenneco. After changing its name to Navistar, the remaining com-
pany was booted from the Dow in 1991 (although it remains a member of
the S & P 500 index). International Flavors & Fragrances, also a constituent
of the S & P 500, had a total stock-market value of $3 billion in early 2003,
versus $1.6 billion for Navistar.

fact, only three years before, the net earnings of Harvester had been
larger than the 1969 sales of Flavors! How did these extraordinary
disparities develop? The answer lies in the two magic words: prof-
itability and growth. Flavors made a remarkable showing in both
categories, while Harvester left everything to be desired.

The story is told in Table 18-5. Here we find Flavors with a sen-
sational profit of 14.3% of sales (before income tax the figure was
23%), compared with a mere 2.6% for Harvester. Similarly, Flavors

460

The Intelligent Investor

had  earned  19.7%  on  its  stock  capital  against  an  inadequate  5.5%
earned by Harvester. In five years the net earnings of Flavors had
nearly  doubled,  while  those  of  Harvester  practically  stood  still.
Between  1969  and  1959  the  comparison  makes  similar  reading.
These differences in performance produced a typical stock-market
divergence  in  valuation.  Flavors  sold  in  1969  at  55  times  its  last
reported earnings, and Harvester at only 10.7 times. Correspond-
ingly, Flavors was valued at 10.4 times its book value, while Har-
vester was selling at a 41% discount from its net worth.

COMMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: The first thing to remark is that the
market success of Flavors was based entirely on the development
of its central business, and involved none of the corporate wheel-
ing  and  dealing,  acquisition  programs,  top-heavy  capitalization
structures, and other familiar Wall Street practices of recent years.
The  company  has  stuck  to  its  extremely  profitable  knitting,  and
that is virtually its whole story. The record of Harvester raises an
entirely different set of questions, but these too have nothing to do
with “high finance.” Why have so many great companies become
relatively unprofitable even during many years of general prosper-
ity? What is the advantage of doing more than $21⁄2 billion of busi-
ness 
justify  the
shareholders’ investment? It is not for us to prescribe the solution
of  this  problem.  But  we  insist  that  not  only  management  but  the
rank and file of shareholders should be conscious that the problem
exists and that it calls for the best brains and the best efforts possi-
ble  to  deal  with  it.*  From  the  standpoint  of  common-stock  selec-
tion,  neither  issue  would  have  met  our  standards  of  sound,
reasonably  attractive,  and  moderately  priced  investment.  Flavors
was  a  typical  brilliantly  successful  but  lavishly  valued  company;

if  the  enterprise  cannot  earn  enough  to 

* For more of Graham’s thoughts on shareholder activism, see the commen-
tary on Chapter 19. In criticizing Harvester for its refusal to maximize share-
holder value, Graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of the company’s
future  management.  In  2001,  a  majority  of  shareholders  voted  to  remove
Navistar’s restrictions against outside takeover bids—but the board of direc-
tors simply refused to implement the shareholders’ wishes. It’s remarkable
that  an  antidemocratic  tendency  in  the  culture  of  some  companies  can
endure for decades.

A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

461

Harvester’s showing was too mediocre to make it really attractive
even  at  its  discount  price.  (Undoubtedly  there  were  better  values
available in the reasonably priced class.)

SEQUEL TO 1971:  The  low  price  of  Harvester  at  the  end  of  1969
protected it from a large further decline in the bad break of 1970. It
lost only 10% more. Flavors proved more vulnerable and declined
to  45,  a  loss  of  30%.  In  the  subsequent  recovery  both  advanced,
well above their 1969 close, but Harvester soon fell back to the 25
level.

Pair 6: McGraw Edison (public utility and equipment;
housewares) McGraw-Hill, Inc. (books, films, instruction
systems; magazine and newspaper publishers; information
services)

This  pair  with  so  similar  names—which  at  times  we  shall  call
Edison and Hill—are two large and successful enterprises in vastly
different fields. We have chosen December 31, 1968, as the date of
our comparison, developed in Table 18-6. The issues were selling at
about the same price, but because of Hill’s larger capitalization it
was valued at about twice the total figure of the other. This differ-
ence should appear somewhat surprising, since Edison had about
50% higher sales and one-quarter larger net earnings. As a result,
we find that the key ratio—the multiplier of earnings—was more
than twice as great for Hill as for Edison. This phenomenon seems
explicable  chiefly  by  the  persistence  of  a  strong  enthusiasm  and
partiality  exhibited  by  the  market  toward  shares  of  book-
publishing  companies,  several  of  which  had  been  introduced  to
public trading in the later 1960s.*

Actually, by the end of 1968 it was evident that this enthusiasm
had  been  overdone.  The  Hill  shares  had  sold  at  56  in  1967,  more
than 40 times the just-reported record earnings for 1966. But a small
decline had appeared in 1967 and a further decline in 1968. Thus the
current high multiplier of 35 was being applied to a company that

* McGraw-Hill remains a publicly-traded company that owns, among other
operations, BusinessWeek magazine  and  Standard  &  Poor’s  Corp.
McGraw–Edison is now a division of Cooper Industries.

had already shown two years of receding profits. Nonetheless the
stock  was  still  valued  at  more  than  eight  times  its  tangible  asset
backing, indicating a good-will component of not far from a billion
dollars!  Thus  the  price  seemed  to  illustrate—in  Dr.  Johnson’s
famous phrase—“The triumph of hope over experience.”

By  contrast,  McGraw  Edison  seemed  quoted  at  a  reasonable
price  in  relation  to  the  (high)  general  market  level  and  to  the
company’s overall performance and financial position.

A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

463

SEQUEL TO EARLY 1971:  The  decline  of  McGraw-Hill’s  earnings
continued  through  1969  and  1970,  dropping  to  $1.02  and  then  to
$.82 per share. In the May 1970 debacle its price suffered a devas-
tating break to 10—less than a fifth of the figure two years before. It
had a good recovery thereafter, but the high of 24 in May 1971 was
still only 60% of the 1968 closing price. McGraw Edison gave a bet-
ter account of itself—declining to 22 in 1970 and recovering fully to
411⁄2 in May 1971.*

McGraw-Hill continues to be a strong and prosperous company.
But its price history exemplifies—as do so many other cases—the
speculative hazards in such stocks created by Wall Street through
its undisciplined waves of optimism and pessimism.

Pair 7: National General Corp. (a large conglomerate) and
National Presto Industries (diverse electric appliances,
ordnance)

These  two  companies  invite  comparison  chiefly  because  they
are so different. Let us call them “General” and “Presto.” We have
selected the end of 1968 for our study, because the write-offs taken
by General in 1969 made the figures for that year too ambiguous.
The full flavor of General’s far-flung activities could not be savored
the  year  before,  but  it  was  already  conglomerate  enough  for
anyone’s taste. The condensed description in the Stock Guide read
“Nation-wide  theatre  chain;  motion  picture  and  TV  production,
savings  and  loan  assn.,  book  publishing.”  To  which  could  be
added,  then  or  later,  “insurance,  investment  banking,  records,
music publishing, computerized services, real estate—and 35% of
Performance  Systems  Inc.  (name  recently  changed  from  Minnie
Pearl’s Chicken System Inc.).” Presto had also followed a diversifi-
cation  program,  but  in  comparison  with  General  it  was  modest
indeed.  Starting  as  the  leading  maker  of  pressure  cookers,  it  had
branched out into various other household and electric appliances.
Quite  differently,  also,  it  took  on  a  number  of  ordnance  contracts
for the U.S. government.

The Intelligent Investor

Our Table 18-7 summarizes the showing of the companies at the
end  of  1968.  The  capital  structure  of  Presto  was  as  simple  as  it
could be—nothing but 1,478,000 shares of common stock, selling in
the market for $58 million. Contrastingly, General had more than
twice as many shares of common, plus an issue of convertible pre-
ferred,  plus  three  issues  of  stock  warrants  calling  for  a  huge
amount  of  common,  plus  a  towering  convertible  bond  issue  (just
given  in  exchange  for  stock  of  an  insurance  company),  plus  a
goodly sum of nonconvertible bonds. All this added up to a market
capitalization of $534 million, not counting an impending issue of
convertible bonds, and $750 million, including such issue. Despite
National General’s enormously greater capitalization, it had actu-
ally done considerably less gross business than Presto in their fiscal
years, and it had shown only 75% of Presto’s net income.

The determination of the true market value of General’s common-
stock  capitalization  presents  an  interesting  problem  for  security
analysts  and  has  important  implications  for  anyone  interested  in
the  stock  on  any  basis  more  serious  than  outright  gambling.  The
relatively small $41⁄2 convertible preferred can be readily taken care
of by assuming its conversion into common, when the latter sells at
a  suitable  market  level.  This  we  have  done  in  Table  18-7.  But  the
warrants  require  different  treatment.  In  calculating  the  “full  dilu-
tion” basis the company assumes exercise of all the warrants, and
the application of the proceeds to the retirement of debt, plus use of
the  balance  to  buy  in  common  at  the  market.  These  assumptions
actually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in
calendar 1968—which were reported as $1.51 both before and after
allowance  for  dilution.  We  consider  this  treatment  illogical  and
unrealistic. As we see it, the warrants represent a part of the “com-
mon-stock package” and their market value is part of the “effective
market  value”  of  the  common-stock  part  of  the  capital.  (See  our
discussion of this point on p. 415 above.) This simple technique of
adding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has
a  radical  effect  on  the  showing  of  National  General  at  the  end  of
1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7. In fact the “true
market price” of the common stock turns out to be more than twice
the quoted figure. Hence the true multiplier of the 1968 earnings is
more  than  doubled—to  the  inherently  absurd  figure  of  69  times.

becomes $413 million, which is over three times the tangible assets
shown therefor.

These figures appear the more anomalous when comparison is
made with those of Presto. One is moved to ask how could Presto
possibly be valued at only 6.9 times its current earnings when the
multiplier for General was nearly 10 times as great. All the ratios of
Presto are quite satisfactory—the growth figure suspiciously so, in
fact. By that we mean that the company was undoubtedly benefit-
ing considerably from its war work, and the shareholders should
be prepared for some falling off in profits under peacetime condi-
tions. But, on balance, Presto met all the requirements of a sound
and  reasonably  priced  investment,  while  General  had  all  the  ear-
marks of a typical “conglomerate” of the late 1960s vintage, full of
corporate gadgets and grandiose gestures, but lacking in substan-
tial values behind the market quotations.

SEQUEL: General continued its diversification policy in 1969, with
some increase in its debt. But it took a whopping write-off of mil-
lions,  chiefly  in  the  value  of  its  investment  in  the  Minnie  Pearl
Chicken deal. The final figures showed a loss of $72 million before
tax credit and $46.4 million after tax credit. The price of the shares
fell to 161⁄2 in 1969 and as low as 9 in 1970 (only 15% of its 1968 high
of 60). Earnings for 1970 were reported as $2.33 per share diluted,
and the price recovered to 281⁄2 in 1971. National Presto increased its
per-share  earnings  somewhat  in  both  1969  and  1970,  marking  10
years  of  uninterrupted  growth  of  profits.  Nonetheless  its  price
declined to 211⁄2 in the 1970 debacle. This was an interesting figure,
since it was less than four times the last reported earnings, and less
than the net current assets available for the stock at the time. Late in
1971 we find the price of National Presto 60% higher, at 34, but the
ratios are still startling. The enlarged working capital is still about
equal  to  the  current  price,  which  in  turn  is  only  51⁄2 times  the  last
reported earnings. If the investor could now find ten such issues, for
diversification, he could be confident of satisfactory results.*

* National  Presto  remains  a  publicly-traded  company.  National  General  was
acquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate, American Financial
Group, which at various times has had interests in cable television, banking,
real estate, mutual funds, insurance, and bananas. AFG is also the final resting
place of some of the assets of Penn Central Corp. (see Chapter 17).

assets for the common, sold at about four times the aggregate value
of  the  other.  The  higher-valued  company  was  about  to  report  a
large loss after special charges; it had not paid a dividend in thir-
teen  years.  The  other  had  a  long  record  of  satisfactory  earnings,
had  paid  continuous  dividends  since  1936,  and  was  currently
returning one of the highest dividend yields in the entire common-
stock list. To indicate more vividly the disparity in the performance
of the two companies we append, in Table 18-8B, the earnings and
price record for 1961–1970.

The history of the two companies throws an interesting light on
the  development  of  medium-sized  businesses  in  this  country,  in
contrast  with  much  larger-sized  companies  that  have  mainly
appeared  in  these  pages.  Whiting  was  incorporated  in  1896,  and
thus goes back at least 75 years. It seems to have kept pretty faith-
fully  to  its  materials-handling  business  and  has  done  quite  well
with it over the decades. Willcox & Gibbs goes back even farther—
to 1866—and was long known in its industry as a prominent maker

A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

of industrial sewing machines. During the past decade it adopted a
policy  of  diversification  in  what  seems  a  rather  outlandish  form.
For on the one hand it has an extraordinarily large number of sub-
sidiary  companies  (at  least  24),  making  an  astonishing  variety  of
products, but on the other hand the entire conglomeration adds up
to mighty small potatoes by usual Wall Street standards.

The earnings developments in Whiting are rather characteristic
of our business concerns. The figures show steady and rather spec-
tacular growth from 41 cents a share in 1960 to $3.63 in 1968. But
they carried no assurance that such growth must continue indefi-
nitely.  The  subsequent  decline  to  only  $1.77  for  the  12  months
ended  January  1971  may  have  reflected  nothing  more  than  the
slowing down of the general economy. But the stock price reacted
in severe fashion, falling about 60% from its 1968 high (431⁄2) to the
close  of  1969.  Our  analysis  would  indicate  that  the  shares  repre-
sented  a  sound  and  attractive  secondary-issue  investment—suit-
able  for  the  enterprising  investor  as  part  of  a  group  of  such
commitments.

SEQUEL: Willcox & Gibbs showed a small operating loss for 1970.
Its  price  declined  drastically  to  a  low  of  41⁄2,  recovering  in  typical
fashion to 91⁄2 in February 1971. It would be hard to justify that price
statistically. Whiting had a relatively small decline, to 163⁄4 in 1970.
(At  that  price  it  was  selling  at  just  about  the  current  assets  alone
available for the shares). Its earnings held at $1.85 per share to July
1971. In early 1971 the price advanced to 241⁄2, which seemed rea-
sonable enough but no longer a “bargain” by our standards.*

General Observations

The issues used in these comparisons were selected with some
malice aforethought, and thus they cannot be said to present a ran-
dom cross-section of the common-stock list. Also they are limited
to the industrial section, and the important areas of public utilities,

* Whiting Corp. ended up a subsidiary of Wheelabrator-Frye, but was taken
private in 1983. Willcox & Gibbs is now owned by Group Rexel, an electri-
cal-equipment manufacturer that is a division of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute
Group of France. Rexel’s shares trade on the Paris Stock Exchange.

But they vary sufficiently in size, lines of business, and qualitative
and  quantitative  aspects  to  convey  a  fair  idea  of  the  choices  con-
fronting an investor in common stocks.

The relationship between price and indicated value has also dif-
fered greatly from one case to another. For the most part the compa-
nies with better growth records and higher profitability have sold at
higher multipliers of current earnings—which is logical enough in

general. Whether the specific differentials in price/earnings ratios
are “justified” by the facts—or will be vindicated by future devel-
opments—cannot be answered with confidence. On the other hand
we do have quite a few instances here in which a worthwhile judg-
ment  can  be  reached.  These  include  virtually  all  the  cases  where
there has been great market activity in companies of questionable
underlying  soundness.  Such  stocks  not  only  were  speculative—
which  means  inherently  risky—but  a  good  deal  of  the  time  they
were  and  are  obviously  overvalued.  Other  issues  appeared  to  be
worth more than their price, being affected by the opposite sort of
market attitude—which we might call “underspeculation”—or by
undue pessimism because of a shrinkage in earnings.

In Table 18-9 we provide some data on the price fluctuations of
the issues covered in this chapter. Most of them had large declines
between  1961  and  1962,  as  well  as  from  1969  to  1970.  Clearly  the
investor  must  be  prepared  for  this  type  of  adverse  market  move-
ment in future stock markets. In Table 18-10 we show year-to-year

fluctuations  of  McGraw-Hill  common  stock  for  the  period
1958–1970. It will be noted that in each of the last 13 years the price
either  advanced  or  declined  over  a  range  of  at  least  three  to  two
from one year to the next. (In the case of National General fluctua-
tions of at least this amplitude both upward and downward were
shown in each two-year period.)

In  studying  the  stock  list  for  the  material  in  this  chapter,  we
were  impressed  once  again  by  the  wide  difference  between  the
usual  objectives  of  security  analysis  and  those  we  deem  depend-
able and rewarding. Most security analysts try to select the issues
that will give the best account of themselves in the future, in terms
chiefly  of  market  action  but  considering  also  the  development  of
earnings. We are frankly skeptical as to whether this can be done
with  satisfactory  results.  Our  preference  for  the  analyst’s  work
would  be  rather  that  he  should  seek  the  exceptional  or  minority
cases in which he can form a reasonably confident judgment that
the  price  is  well  below  value.  He  should  be  able  to  do  this  work
with  sufficient  expertness  to  produce  satisfactory  average  results
over the years.

using the same compare-and-contrast technique that he pioneered in
his lectures at Columbia Business School and the New York Institute
of Finance. Bear in mind that these summaries describe these stocks
only at the times specified. The cheap stocks may later become over-
priced; the expensive stocks may turn cheap. At some point in its life,
almost every stock is a bargain; at another time, it will be expensive.
Although there are good and bad companies, there is no such thing as
a good stock; there are only good stock prices, which come and go.

On  March  27,  2000,  Cisco  Systems,  Inc.,  became  the  world’s  most
valuable corporation as its stock hit $548 billion in total value. Cisco,
which makes equipment that directs data over the Internet, first sold
its shares to the public only 10 years earlier. Had you bought Cisco’s
stock in the initial offering and kept it, you would have earned a gain
resembling a typographical error made by a madman: 103,697%, or a
217%  average  annual  return.  Over  its  previous  four  fiscal  quarters,
Cisco  had  generated  $14.9  billion  in  revenues  and  $2.5  billion  in
earnings. The stock was trading at 219 times Cisco’s net income, one
of the highest price/earnings ratios ever accorded to a large company.
Then  there  was  Sysco  Corp.,  which  supplies  food  to  institutional

kitchens and had been publicly traded for 30 years. Over its last four
quarters,  Sysco  served  up  $17.7  billion  in  revenues—almost  20%
more than Cisco—but “only” $457 million in net income. With a market
value  of  $11.7  billion,  Sysco’s  shares  traded  at  26  times  earnings,
well below the market’s average P/E ratio of 31.

A word-association game with a typical investor might have gone

like this.

Cisco Systems?

A: The Internet . . . the industry of the future . . . great stock . . . hot

It’s  well  established  that  people  often  assign  a  mental  value  to
stocks based largely on the emotional imagery that companies evoke.1
But the intelligent investor always digs deeper. Here’s what a skeptical
look at Cisco and Sysco’s financial statements would have turned up:

• Much  of  Cisco’s  growth  in  revenues  and  earnings  came  from
acquisitions. Since September alone, Cisco had ponied up $10.2
billion to buy 11 other firms. How could so many companies be
mashed  together  so  quickly? 2 Also,  roughly  a  third  of  Cisco’s

discovered a cure for a rare cancer, or one that discovered a new way to
dispose of a common kind of garbage. The cancer cure sounds more excit-
ing to most investors, but a new way to get rid of trash would probably make
more money. See Paul Slovic, Melissa Finucane, Ellen Peters, and Donald
G. MacGregor, “The Affect Heuristic,” in Thomas Gilovich, Dale Griffin, and
Daniel Kahneman, eds., Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive
Judgment (Cambridge  University  Press,  New  York,  2002),  pp.  397–420,

of Psychology and Financial Markets, vol. 3, no. 1, 2002, pp. 15–22.

earnings  over  the  previous  six  months  came  not  from  its  busi-
nesses,  but  from  tax  breaks  on  stock  options  exercised  by  its
executives  and  employees.  And  Cisco  had  gained  $5.8  billion
selling “investments,” then bought $6 billion more. Was it an Inter-
net  company  or  a  mutual  fund?  What  if  those  “investments”
stopped going up?
Sysco  had  also  acquired  several  companies  over  the  same
period—but  paid  only  about  $130  million.  Stock  options  for
Sysco’s insiders totaled only 1.5% of shares outstanding, versus
6.9% at Cisco. If insiders cashed their options, Sysco’s earnings
per  share  would  be  diluted  much  less  than  Cisco’s.  And  Sysco
had  raised  its  quarterly  dividend  from  nine  cents  a  share  to  10;
Cisco paid no dividend.

Finally, as Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel pointed out, no
company as big as Cisco had ever been able to grow fast enough to
justify a price/earnings ratio above 60—let alone a P/E ratio over 200.3
Once a company becomes a giant, its growth must slow down—or it
will  end  up  eating  the  entire  world.  The  great  American  satirist
Ambrose  Bierce  coined  the  word  “incompossible”  to  describe  two
things  that  are  conceivable  separately  but  cannot  exist  together.  A
company can be a giant, or it can deserve a giant P/E ratio, but both
together are incompossible.

The  wheels  soon  came  off  the  Cisco  juggernaut.  First,  in  2001,
came  a  $1.2  billion  charge  to  “restructure”  some  of  those  acquisi-
tions. Over the next two years, $1.3 billion in losses on those “invest-
ments”  leaked  out.  From  2000  through  2002,  Cisco’s  stock  lost
three-quarters of its value. Sysco, meanwhile, kept dishing out profits,
and the stock gained 56% over the same period (see Figure 18-1).

a  63.6%  gain  in  five  trading  days.  Yahoo!  kept  whooping  along
through year-end, closing at $432.687 on December 31. In a single
month, the stock had more than doubled, gaining roughly $58 billion
to reach a total market value of $114 billion.4

In the previous four quarters, Yahoo! had racked up $433 million in
revenues and $34.9 million in net income. So Yahoo!’s stock was now
priced at 263 times revenues and 3,264 times earnings. (Remember
that a P/E ratio much above 25 made Graham grimace!)5

Why  was  Yahoo!  screaming  upward?  After  the  market  closed  on
November 30, Standard & Poor’s announced that it would add Yahoo!
to its S & P 500 index as of December 7. That would make Yahoo! a
compulsory holding for index funds and other big investors—and that
sudden  rise  in  demand  was  sure  to  drive  the  stock  even  higher,  at
least temporarily. With some 90% of Yahoo!’s stock locked up in the
hands of employees, venture-capital firms, and other restricted hold-
ers, just a fraction of its shares could trade. So thousands of people
bought the stock only because they knew other people would have to
buy it—and price was no object.

4 Yahoo!’s stock split two-for-one in February 2000; the share prices given
here are not adjusted for that split in order to show the levels the stock actu-
ally  traded  at.  But  Yahoo!’s  percentage  return  and  market  value,  as  cited
here, do reflect the split.
5 Counting  the  effect  of  acquisitions,  Yahoo!’s  revenues  were  $464  million.

Meanwhile, Yum! went begging. A former division of PepsiCo that
runs thousands of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell
eateries, Yum! had produced $8 billion in revenues over the previous
four quarters, on which it earned $633 million—making it more than 17
times Yahoo!’s size. Yet Yum!’s stock-market value at year-end 1999
was only $5.9 billion, or 1/19 of Yahoo!’s capitalization. At that price,
Yum!’s stock was selling at just over nine times its earnings and only
73% of its revenues.6

As  Graham  liked  to  say,  in  the  short  run  the  market  is  a  voting
machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine. Yahoo! won the
short-term popularity contest. But in the end, it’s earnings that matter—
and  Yahoo!  barely  had  any.  Once  the  market  stopped  voting  and
started weighing, the scales tipped toward Yum! Its stock rose 25.4%
from 2000 through 2002, while Yahoo!’s lost 92.4% cumulatively:

designs Internet “exchanges” for corporate purchasing departments)
showed assets of just $385 million and reported a net loss of $63 mil-
lion on only $34 million in total revenues. The stock of this minuscule
company had risen nearly 900% since its IPO, hitting a total market
capitalization  of  $15  billion. Was  it  overpriced?  “Yes,  we  have  a  big
market  cap,”  Commerce  One’s  chief  executive,  Mark  Hoffman,
shrugged in an interview. “But we have a big market to play in. We’re
seeing incredible demand. . . . Analysts expect us to make $140 mil-
lion in revenue this year. And in the past we have exceeded expecta-
tions.”

Two things jump out from Hoffman’s answer:

•

•

Since  Commerce  One  was  already  losing  $2  on  every  dollar  in
sales, if it quadrupled its revenues (as “analysts expect”), wouldn’t
it lose money even more massively?
How could Commerce One have exceeded expectations “in the
past”? What past?

Asked whether his company would ever turn a profit, Hoffman was
ready:  “There  is  no  question  we  can  turn  this  into  a  profitable  busi-
ness. We plan on becoming profitable in the fourth quarter of 2001, a
year analysts see us making over $250 million in revenues.”

There come those analysts again! “I like Commerce One at these
levels  because  it’s  growing  faster  than  Ariba  [a  close  competitor
whose  stock  was  also  trading  at  around  400  times  revenues],”  said
Jeanette Sing, an analyst at the Wasserstein Perella investment bank.
“If these growth rates continue, Commerce One will be trading at 60
to 70 times sales in 2001.” (In other words, I can name a stock that’s
more overpriced than Commerce One, so Commerce One is cheap.)7
At the other extreme was Capital One Financial Corp., an issuer of
MasterCard and Visa credit cards. From July 1999, to May 2000, its
stock lost 21.5%. Yet Capital One had $12 billion in total assets and
earned  $363  million  in  1999,  up  32%  from  the  year  before.  With  a
market value of about $7.3 billion, the stock sold at 20 times Capital
One’s net earnings. All might not be well at Capital One—the company
had barely raised its reserves for loans that might go bad, even though

default rates tend to jump in a recession—but its stock price reflected
at least some risk of potential trouble.

What happened next? In 2001, Commerce One generated $409
million  in  revenues.  Unfortunately,  it  ran  a  net  loss  of  $2.6  billion—or
$10.30 of red ink per share—on those revenues. Capital One, on the
other  hand,  earned  nearly  $2  billion  in  net  income  in  2000  through
2002. Its stock lost 38% in those three years—no worse than the stock
market as a whole. Commerce One, however, lost 99.7% of its value.8
Instead  of  listening  to  Hoffman  and  his  lapdog  analysts,  traders
should have heeded the honest warning in Commerce One’s annual
report for 1999: “We have never been profitable. We expect to incur
net losses for the foreseeable future and we may never be profitable.”

On March 2, 2000, the data-networking company 3Com Corp. sold
5%  of  its  Palm,  Inc.  subsidiary  to  the  public.  The  remaining  95%  of
Palm’s  stock  would  be  spun  off  to  3Com’s  shareholders  in  the  next
few  months;  for  each  share  of  3Com  they  held,  investors  would
receive 1.525 shares of Palm.

So there were two ways you could get 100 shares of Palm: By try-
ing to elbow your way into the IPO, or by buying 66 shares of 3Com
and waiting until the parent company distributed the rest of the Palm
stock.  Getting  one-and-a-half  shares  of  Palm  for  each  3Com  share,
you’d  end  up  with  100  shares  of  the  new  company—and  you’d  still
have 66 shares of 3Com.

But who wanted to wait a few months? While 3Com was struggling
against giant rivals like Cisco, Palm was a leader in the hot “space” of
handheld digital organizers. So Palm’s stock shot up from its offering price
of $38 to close at $95.06, a 150% first-day return. That valued Palm at
more than 1,350 times its earnings over the previous 12 months.

That  same  day,  3Com’s  share  price  dropped from  $104.13  to
$81.81. Where should 3Com have closed that day, given the price of
Palm? The arithmetic is easy:

8 In early 2003, Capital One’s chief financial officer resigned after securities
regulators  revealed  that  they  might  charge  him  with  violations  of  laws
against insider trading.

each 3Com share was entitled to receive 1.525 shares of Palm
each share of Palm closed at $95.06
1.525 (cid:1) $95.06 = $144.97

That’s  what  each  3Com  share  was  worth  based  on  its  stake  in
Palm alone. Thus, at $81.81, traders were saying that all of 3Com’s
other businesses combined were worth a negative $63.16 per share,
or a total of minus $22 billion! Rarely in history has any stock been
priced more stupidly.9

But  there  was  a  catch:  Just  as  3Com  wasn’t  really  worth  minus
$22  billion,  Palm  wasn’t  really  worth  over  1,350  times  earnings.  By
the end of 2002, both stocks were hurting in the high-tech recession,
but it was Palm’s shareholders who really got smacked—because they
abandoned all common sense when they bought in the first place:

P A I R   5 :   C M G I   A N D   C G I

The year 2000 started off with a bang for CMGI, Inc., as the stock hit
$163.22 on January 3—a gain of 1,126% over its price just one year
before.  The  company,  an  “Internet  incubator,”  financed  and  acquired
start-up firms in a variety of online businesses—among them such early
stars as theglobe.com and Lycos.10

In  fiscal  year  1998,  as  its  stock  rose  from  98  cents  to  $8.52,
CMGI spent $53.8 million acquiring whole or partial stakes in Internet
companies.  In  fiscal  year  1999,  as  its  stock  shot  from  $8.52  to
$46.09, CMGI shelled out $104.7 million. And in the last five months
of 1999, as its shares zoomed up to $138.44, CMGI spent $4.1 bil-
lion  on  acquisitions.  Virtually  all  the  “money”  was  CMGI’s  own  pri-
vately-minted  currency:  its  common  stock,  now  valued  at  a  total  of
more than $40 billion.

It was a kind of magical money merry-go-round. The higher CMGI’s
own  stock  went,  the  more  it  could  afford  to  buy.  The  more  CMGI
could afford to buy, the higher its stock went. First stocks would go up
on the rumor that CMGI might buy them; then, once CMGI acquired
them,  its  own  stock  would  go  up  because  it  owned  them.  No  one
cared that CMGI had lost $127 million on its operations in the latest
fiscal year.

Down in Webster, Massachusetts, less than 70 miles southwest of
CMGI’s  headquarters  in  Andover,  sits  the  main  office  of  Commerce
Group, Inc. CGI was everything CMGI was not: Offering automobile
insurance, mainly to drivers in Massachusetts, it was a cold stock in an
old industry. Its shares lost 23% in 1999—although its net income, at
$89 million, ended up falling only 7% below 1998’s level. CGI even
paid a dividend of more than 4% (CMGI paid none). With a total mar-
ket value of $870 million, CGI stock was trading at less than 10 times
what the company would earn for 1999.

And  then,  quite  suddenly,  everything  went  into  reverse.  CMGI’s
magical  money  merry-go-round  screeched  to  a  halt:  Its  dot-com

10 CMGI began corporate life as College Marketing Group, which sold infor-
mation  about  college  professors  and  courses  to  academic  publishers—a
business that bore a faint but disturbing similarity to National Student Mar-
keting, discussed by Graham on p. 235.

482

Commentary on Chapter 18

stocks  stopped  rising  in  price,  then  went  straight  down.  No  longer
able to sell them for a profit, CMGI had to take their loss in value as a
hit to its earnings. The company lost $1.4 billion in 2000, $5.5 billion
in 2001, and nearly $500 million more in 2002. Its stock went from
$163.22 at the beginning of 2000 to 98 cents by year-end 2002—a
loss  of  99.4%.  Boring  old  CGI,  however,  kept  cranking  out  steady
earnings, and its stock rose 8.5% in 2000, 43.6% in 2001, and 2.7%
in 2002—a 60% cumulative gain.

Between  July  9  and  July  23,  2002,  Ball  Corp.’s  stock  dropped  from
$43.69 to $33.48—a loss of 24% that left the company with a stock-
market value of $1.9 billion. Over the same two weeks, Stryker Corp.’s
shares fell from $49.55 to $45.60, an 8% drop that left Strkyer valued
at a total of $9 billion.

What  had  made  these  two  companies  worth  so  much  less  in  so
short  a  time?  Stryker,  which  manufactures  orthopedic  implants  and
surgical  equipment,  issued  only  one  press  release  during  those  two
weeks.  On  July  16,  Stryker  announced  that  its  sales  grew  15%  to
$734  million  in  the  second  quarter,  while  earnings  jumped  31%  to
$86  million.  The  stock  rose  7%  the  next  day,  then  rolled  right  back
downhill.

Ball, the original maker of the famous “Ball Jars” used for canning
fruits  and  vegetables,  now  makes  metal  and  plastic  packaging  for
industrial customers. Ball issued no press releases at all during those
two weeks. On July 25, however, Ball reported that it had earned $50
million on sales of $1 billion in the second quarter—a 61% rise in net
income over the same period one year earlier. That brought its earn-
ings over the trailing four quarters to $152 million, so the stock was
trading  at  just  12.5  times  Ball’s  earnings.  And,  with  a  book  value  of
$1.1 billion, you could buy the stock for 1.7 times what the company’s
tangible  assets  were  worth.  (Ball  did,  however,  have  just  over  $900
million in debt.)

Stryker  was  in  a  different  league.  Over  the  last  four  quarters,  the
company  had  generated  $301  million  in  net  income.  Stryker’s  book
value was $570 million. So the company was trading at fat multiples of
30 times its earnings over the past 12 months and nearly 16 times its
book value. On the other hand, from 1992 through the end of 2001,
Stryker’s earnings had risen 18.6% annually; its dividend had grown

Commentary on Chapter 18

483

by nearly 21% per year. And in 2001, Stryker had spent $142 million
on research and development to lay the groundwork for future growth.
What, then, had pounded these two stocks down? Between July 9
and July 23, 2002, as WorldCom keeled over into bankruptcy, the Dow
Jones  Industrial  Average  fell  from  9096.09  to  7702.34,  a  15.3%
plunge. The good news at Ball and Stryker got lost in the bad headlines
and falling markets, which took these two stocks down with them.

Although Ball ended up priced far more cheaply than Stryker, the
lesson here is not that Ball was a steal and Stryker was a wild pitch.
Instead,  the  intelligent  investor  should  recognize  that  market  panics
can  create  great  prices  for  good  companies  (like  Ball)  and  good
prices for great companies (like Stryker). Ball finished 2002 at $51.19
a share, up 53% from its July low; Stryker ended the year at $67.12,
up 47%. Every once in a while, value and growth stocks alike go on
sale. Which choice you prefer depends largely on your own personal-
ity, but bargains can be had on either side of the plate.

P A I R   7 :   N O R T E L   A N D   N O R T E K

The 1999 annual report for Nortel Networks, the fiber-optic equipment
company, boasted that it was “a golden year financially.” As of Febru-
ary 2000, at a market value of more than $150 billion, Nortel’s stock
traded at 87 times the earnings that Wall Street’s analysts estimated
the company would produce in 2000.

How  credible  was  that  estimate?  Nortel’s  accounts  receivable—
sales to customers that had not yet paid the bill—had shot up by $1
billion in a year. The company said the rise “was driven by increased
sales in the fourth quarter of 1999.” However, inventories had also bal-
looned by $1.2 billion—meaning that Nortel was producing equipment
even faster than those “increased sales” could unload it.

Meanwhile,  Nortel’s  “long-term  receivables”—bills  not  yet  paid  for
multi-year contracts—jumped from $519 million to $1.4 billion. And Nor-
tel  was  having  a  hard  time  controlling  costs;  its  selling,  general,  and
administrative expense (or overhead) had risen from 17.6% of revenues
in 1997 to 18.7% in 1999. All told, Nortel had lost $351 million in 1999.
Then there was Nortek, Inc., which produces stuff at the dim end of
the glamour spectrum: vinyl siding, door chimes, exhaust fans, range
hoods, trash compactors. In 1999, Nortek earned $49 million on $2
billion in net sales, up from $21 million in net income on $1.1 billion in
sales in 1997. Nortek’s profit margin (net earnings as a percentage of

484

Commentary on Chapter 18

net sales) had risen by almost a third from 1.9% to 2.5%. And Nortek
had cut overhead from 19.3% of revenues to 18.1%.

To be  fair,  much  of  Nortek’s  expansion  came  from  buying  other
companies, not from internal growth. What’s more, Nortek had $1 bil-
lion in debt, a big load for a small firm. But, in February 2000, Nortek’s
stock price—roughly five times its earnings in 1999—included a healthy
dose of pessimism.

On the other hand, Nortel’s price—87 times the guesstimate of what it
might earn in the year to come—was a massive overdose of optimism.
When all was said and done, instead of earning the $1.30 per share that
analysts had predicted, Nortel lost $1.17 per share in 2000. By the end
of 2002, Nortel had bled more than $36 billion in red ink.

Nortek, on the other hand, earned $41.6 million in 2000, $8 million
in  2001,  and  $55  million  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2002.  Its  stock
went from $28 a share to $45.75 by year-end 2002—a 63% gain. In
January 2003, Nortek’s managers took the company private, buying all
the stock from public investors at $46 per share. Nortel’s stock, mean-
while,  sank  from  $56.81  in  February  2000,  to  $1.61  at  year-end
2002—a 97% loss.

On  August  11,  1999,  Red  Hat,  Inc.,  a  developer  of  Linux  software,
sold stock to the public for the first time. Red Hat was red-hot; initially
offered  at  $7,  the  shares  opened  for  trading  at  $23  and  closed  at
$26.031—a 272% gain.11 In a single day, Red Hat’s stock had gone up
more than Brown Shoe’s had in the previous 18 years. By December
9, Red Hat’s shares hit $143.13—up 1,944% in four months.

Brown  Shoe,  meanwhile,  had  its  laces  tied  together.  Founded  in
1878,  the  company  wholesales  Buster  Brown  shoes  and  runs  nearly
1,300 footwear stores in the United States and Canada. Brown Shoe’s
stock, at $17.50 a share on August 11, stumbled down to $14.31 by
December 9. For all of 1999, Brown Shoe’s shares lost 17.6%.12

11 All stock prices for Red Hat are adjusted for its two-for-one stock split in
January 2000.
12 Ironically, 65 years earlier Graham had singled out Brown Shoe as one of
the most stable companies on the New York Stock Exchange. See the 1934
edition of Security Analysis, p. 159.

Commentary on Chapter 18

Besides a cool name and a hot stock, what did Red Hat’s investors
get? Over the nine months ending November 30, the company pro-
duced $13 million in revenues, on which it ran a net loss of $9 mil-
lion.13 Red  Hat’s  business  was  barely  bigger  than  a  street-corner
delicatessen—and  a  lot  less  lucrative.  But  traders,  inflamed  by  the
words  “software”  and  “Internet,”  drove  the  total  value  of  Red  Hat’s
shares to $21.3 billion by December 9.

And Brown Shoe? Over the previous three quarters, the company
had  produced  $1.2  billion  in  net  sales  and  $32  million  in  earnings.
Brown Shoe had nearly $5 a share in cash and real estate; kids were
still buying Buster Brown shoes. Yet, that December 9, Brown Shoe’s
stock  had  a  total  value  of  $261  million—barely  1/80  the  size  of  Red
Hat even though Brown Shoe had 100 times Red Hat’s revenues. At
that  price,  Brown  Shoe  was  valued  at  7.6  times  its  annual  earnings
and  less  than  one-quarter  of  its  annual  sales.  Red  Hat,  on  the  other
hand,  had  no  profits  at  all,  while  its  stock  was  selling  at  more  than
1,000 times its annual sales.

Red Hat the company kept right on gushing red ink. Soon enough,
the  stock  did  too.  Brown  Shoe,  however,  trudged  out  more  profits—
and so did its shareholders:

Commentary on Chapter 18

What have we learned? The market scoffs at Graham’s principles
in the short run, but they are always revalidated in the end. If you buy a
stock purely because its price has been going up—instead of asking
whether the underlying company’s value is increasing—then sooner or
later you will be extremely sorry. That’s not a likelihood. It is a certainty.

Shareholders and Managements: 

Dividend Policy

Ever since 1934 we have argued in our writings for a more intelli-
gent and energetic attitude by shareholders toward their manage-
ments.  We  have  asked  them  to  take  a  generous  attitude  toward
those  who  are  demonstrably  doing  a  good  job.  We  have  asked
them  also  to  demand  clear  and  satisfying  explanations  when  the
results  appear  to  be  worse  than  they  should  be,  and  to  support
movements  to  improve  or  remove  clearly  unproductive  manage-
ments. Shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the com-
petence of the management when the results (1) are unsatisfactory
in themselves, (2) are poorer than those obtained by other compa-
nies  that  appear  similarly  situated,  and  (3)  have  resulted  in  an
unsatisfactory market price of long duration.

In the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been accom-
plished through intelligent action by the great body of sharehold-
ers. A sensible crusader—if there are any such—would take this as
a  sign  that  he  has  been  wasting  his  time,  and  that  he  had  better
give up the fight. As it happens our cause has not been lost; it has
been  rescued  by  an  extraneous  development—known  as  take-
overs, or take-over bids.* We said in Chapter 8 that poor manage-

* Ironically,  takeovers  began  drying  up  shortly  after  Graham’s  last  revised
edition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the absolute low
point  of  modern  American  industrial  efficiency.  Cars  were  “lemons,”  televi-
sions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the managers of many
publicly-traded  companies  ignored  both  the  present  interests  of  their  out-
side shareholders and the future prospects of their own businesses. All of

487

ments produce poor market prices. The low market prices, in turn,
attract  the  attention  of  companies  interested  in  diversifying  their
operations—and these are now legion. Innumerable such acquisi-
tions have been accomplished by agreement with the existing man-
agements, or else by accumulation of shares in the market and by
offers  made  over  the  head  of  those  in  control.  The  price  bid  has
usually been within the range of the value of the enterprise under
reasonably  competent  management.  Hence,  in  many  cases,  the
inert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions of “out-
siders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups
acting on their own.

It  can  be  stated  as  a  rule  with  very  few  exceptions  that  poor
managements are not changed by action of the “public stockhold-
ers,” but only by the assertion of control by an individual or com-
pact group. This is happening often enough these days to put the
management, including the board of directors, of a typical publicly
controlled company on notice that if its operating results and the
resulting market price are highly unsatisfactory, it may become the
target of a successful take-over move. As a consequence, boards of
directors have probably become more alive than previously to their
fundamental duty to see that their company has a satisfactory top
management. Many more changes of presidents have been seen in
recent years than formerly.

Not  all  companies  in  the  unsatisfactory  class  have  benefited
from such developments. Also, the change has often occurred after
a  long  period  of  bad  results  without  remedial  action,  and  has
depended on enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low
prices  to  permit  the  energetic  outsiders  to  acquire  a  controlling
position in the shares. But the idea that public shareholders could
really  help  themselves  by  supporting  moves  for  improving  man-
agement and management policies has proved too quixotic to war-

this began to change in 1984, when independent oilman T. Boone Pickens
launched  a  hostile  takeover  bid  for  Gulf  Oil.  Soon,  fueled  by  junk-bond
financing provided by Drexel Burnham Lambert, “corporate raiders” stalked
the landscape of corporate America, scaring long-sclerotic companies into
a new regimen of efficiency. While many of the companies involved in buy-
outs and takeovers were ravaged, the rest of American business emerged
both leaner (which was good) and meaner (which sometimes was not).

rant further space in this book. Those individual shareholders who
have enough gumption to make their presence felt at annual meet-
ings—generally  a  completely  futile  performance—will  not  need
our  counsel  on  what  points  to  raise  with  the  managements.  For
others the advice would probably be wasted. Nevertheless, let us
close this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an
open mind and with careful attention any proxy material sent them
by fellow-shareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatis-
factory management situation in the company.

Shareholders and Dividend Policy

In the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of
argument  between  public,  or  “minority,”  shareholders  and  man-
agements. In general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi-
dends,  while  the  managements  preferred  to  keep  the  earnings  in
the  business  “to  strengthen  the  company.”  They  asked  the  share-
holders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter-
prise and for their own future long-term benefit. But in recent years
the attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a
gradual but significant change. The basic argument now for paying
small  rather  than  liberal  dividends  is  not  that  the  company
“needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to the shareholders’
direct  and  immediate  advantage  by  retaining  the  funds  for  prof-
itable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company that
was more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of paying
out  the  usual  60%  to  75%  of  them  in  dividends.  The  effect  was
almost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays
it is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber-
ately  keeps  down  its  dividend  payments,  with  the  approval  of
investors and speculators alike.*

There was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof-

* The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s,
when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less likely it
was  to  pay  a  dividend—or  for  its  shareholders  to  want  one.  The  “payout
ratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies paid out as div-
idends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35% to 40% by
the end of the 1990s.

The Intelligent Investor

its  in  the  business  where  such  retention  could  be  counted  on  to
produce  a  goodly  increase  in  earnings.  But  there  were  several
strong  counter-arguments,  such  as:  The  profits  “belong”  to  the
shareholders,  and  they  are  entitled  to  have  them  paid  out  within
the limits of prudent management; many of the shareholders need
their dividend income to live on; the earnings they receive in divi-
dends are “real money,” while those retained in the company may
or may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders.
These counter-arguments were so compelling, in fact, that the stock
market  showed  a  persistent  bias  in  favor  of  the  liberal  dividend
payers  as  against  the  companies  that  paid  no  dividends  or  rela-
tively small ones.1

In  the  last  20  years  the  “profitable  reinvestment”  theory  has
been  gaining  ground.  The  better  the  past  record  of  growth,  the
readier  investors  and  speculators  have  become  to  accept  a  low-
pay-out policy. So much is this true that in many cases of growth
favorites the dividend rate—or even the absence of any dividend—
has seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price.*

A striking example of this development is found in the history
of Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock
rose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing
from 43 cents to $3.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind
was paid. (In 1962 cash dividends were initiated, but by that year
the earnings had fallen to $2.14 and the price had shown a spectac-
ular drop to a low of 49.)

Another  extreme  illustration  is  provided  by  Superior  Oil.  In
1948 the company reported earnings of $35.26 per share, paid $3 in
dividends,  and  sold  as  high  as  235.  In  1953  the  dividend  was
reduced to $1, but the high price was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend

* In  the  late  1990s,  technology  companies  were  particularly  strong  advo-
cates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back into the
business,”  where  they  could  earn  higher  returns  than  any  outside  share-
holder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him
or  her  in  dividends.  Incredibly,  investors  never  questioned  the  truth  of  this
patronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or even realized that a company’s
cash  belongs  to  the  shareholders,  not  its  managers.  See  the  commentary
on this chapter.

at all, and sold at 2,000! This unusual issue later declined to 795 in
1962, when it earned $49.50 and paid $7.50.*

Investment  sentiment  is  far  from  crystallized  in  this  matter  of
dividend  policy  of  growth  companies.  The  conflicting  views  are
well  illustrated  by  the  cases  of  two  of  our  very  largest  corpora-
tions—American  Telephone  &  Telegraph  and  International  Busi-
ness  Machines.  American  Tel.  &  Tel.  came  to  be  regarded  as  an
issue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in
1961  it  sold  at  25  times  that  year’s  earnings.  Nevertheless,  the
company’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and
speculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making
an active response to even rumors of an impending increase in the
dividend  rate.  On  the  other  hand,  comparatively  little  attention
appears to have been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in
1960 yielded only 0.5% at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the
close  of  1970.  (But  in  both  cases  stock  splits  have  operated  as  a
potent stock-market influence.)

The  market’s  appraisal  of  cash-dividend  policy  appears  to  be
developing  in  the  following  direction:  Where  prime  emphasis  is
not placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and
the  dividend  rate  retains  its  long-held  importance  as  the  prime
determinant  of  market  price. At  the  other  extreme,  stocks  clearly
recognized to be in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily
in terms of the expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and
the cash-dividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.

While  the  above  statement  may  properly  describe  present  ten-
dencies,  it  is  by  no  means  a  clear-cut  guide  to  the  situation  in  all
common stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one
thing, many companies occupy an intermediate position between
growth  and  nongrowth  enterprises.  It  is  hard  to  say  how  much
importance should be ascribed to the growth factor in such cases,
and the market’s view thereof may change radically from year to
year.  Secondly,  there  seems  to  be  something  paradoxical  about

* Superior  Oil’s  stock  price  peaked  at  $2165  per  share  in  1959,  when  it
paid a $4 dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced stock
listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  Superior,  controlled  by  the  Keck
family of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.

requiring the companies showing slower growth to be more liberal
with their cash dividends. For these are generally the less prosper-
ous concerns, and in the past the more prosperous the company the
greater  was  the  expectation  of  both  liberal  and  increasing  pay-
ments.

It  is  our  belief  that  shareholders  should  demand  of  their  man-
agements either a normal payout of earnings—on the order, say, of
two-thirds—or  else  a  clear-cut  demonstration  that  the  reinvested
profits have produced a satisfactory increase in per-share earnings.
Such a demonstration could ordinarily be made in the case of a rec-
ognized growth company. But in many other cases a low payout is
clearly  the  cause  of  an  average  market  price  that  is  below  fair
value,  and  here  the  shareholders  have  every  right  to  inquire  and
probably to complain.

A niggardly  policy  has  often  been  imposed  on  a  company
because its financial position is relatively weak, and it has needed
all or most of its earnings (plus depreciation charges) to pay debts
and bolster its working-capital position. When this is so there is not
much the shareholders can say about it—except perhaps to criticize
the  management  for  permitting  the  company  to  fall  into  such  an
unsatisfactory  financial  position.  However,  dividends  are  some-
times  held  down  by  relatively  unprosperous  companies  for  the
declared  purpose  of  expanding  the  business.  We  feel  that  such  a
policy  is  illogical  on  its  face,  and  should  require  both  a  complete
explanation  and  a  convincing  defense  before  the  shareholders
should accept it. In terms of the past record there is no reason a pri-
ori  to  believe  that  the  owners  will  benefit  from  expansion  moves
undertaken  with  their  money  by  a  business  showing  mediocre
results and continuing its old management.

Stock Dividends and Stock Splits

It is important that investors understand the essential difference
between  a  stock  dividend  (properly  so-called)  and  a  stock  split.
The  latter  represents  a  restatement  of  the  common-stock  struc-
ture—in a typical case by issuing two or three shares for one. The
new shares are not related to specific earnings reinvested in a spe-
cific past period. Its purpose is to establish a lower market price for
the  single  shares,  presumably  because  such  lower  price  range

Shareholders and Managements

493

would  be  more  acceptable  to  old  and  new  shareholders.  A stock
split may be carried out by what technically may be called a stock
dividend, which involves a transfer of sums from earned surplus
to capital account; or else by a change in par value, which does not
affect the surplus account.*

What we should call a proper stock dividend is one that is paid to
shareholders to give them a tangible evidence or representation of
specific earnings  which  have  been  reinvested  in  the  business  for
their account over some relatively short period in the recent past—
say,  not  more  than  the  two  preceding  years.  It  is  now  approved
practice to value such a stock dividend at the approximate value at
the  time  of  declaration,  and  to  transfer  an  amount  equal  to  such
value from earned surplus to capital accounts. Thus the amount of
a typical stock dividend is relatively small—in most cases not more
than 5%. In essence a stock dividend of this sort has the same over-
all  effect  as  the  payment  of  an  equivalent  amount  of  cash  out  of
earnings when accompanied by the sale of additional shares of like
total value to the shareholders. However, a straight stock dividend
has  an  important  tax  advantage  over  the  otherwise  equivalent
combination  of  cash  dividends  with  stock  subscription  rights,
which is the almost standard practice for public-utility companies.
The  New  York  Stock  Exchange  has  set  the  figure  of  25%  as  a
practical  dividing  line  between  stock  splits  and  stock  dividends.
Those of 25% or more need not be accompanied by the transfer of
their  market  value  from  earned  surplus  to  capital,  and  so  forth.†
Some  companies,  especially  banks,  still  follow  the  old  practice  of

* Today,  virtually  all  stock  splits  are  carried  out  by  a  change  in  value.  In  a
two-for-one  split,  one  share  becomes  two,  each  trading  at  half  the  former
price of the original single share; in a three-for-one split, one share becomes
three, each trading at a third of the former price; and so on. Only in very rare
cases is a sum transferred “from earned surplus to capital account,” as in
Graham’s day.
† Rule 703 of the New York Stock Exchange governs stock splits and stock
dividends. The NYSE now designates stock dividends of greater than 25%
and less than 100% as “partial stock splits.” Unlike in Graham’s day, these
stock  dividends  may  now  trigger  the  NYSE’s  accounting  requirement  that
the amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained earnings.

494

The Intelligent Investor

declaring any kind of stock dividend they please—e.g., one of 10%,
not  related  to  recent  earnings—and  these  instances  maintain  an
undesirable confusion in the financial world.

We have long been a strong advocate of a systematic and clearly
enunciated  policy  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  cash  and  stock
dividends. Under such a policy, stock dividends are paid periodi-
cally to capitalize all or a stated portion of the earnings reinvested
in  the  business.  Such  a  policy—covering  100%  of  the  reinvested
earnings—has  been  followed  by  Purex,  Government  Employees
Insurance, and perhaps a few others.*

Stock dividends of all types seem to be disapproved of by most
academic writers on the subject. They insist that they are nothing
but  pieces  of  paper,  that  they  give  the  shareholders  nothing  they
did  not  have  before,  and  that  they  entail  needless  expense  and
inconvenience.† On our side we consider this a completely doctri-
naire  view,  which  fails  to  take  into  account  the  practical  and 
psychological  realities  of  investment.  True,  a  periodic  stock  divi-
dend—say of 5%—changes only the “form” of the owners’ invest-
ment.  He  has  105  shares  in  place  of  100;  but  without  the  stock
dividend the original 100 shares would have represented the same

* This  policy,  already  unusual  in  Graham’s  day,  is  extremely  rare  today.  In
1936  and  again  in  1950,  roughly  half  of  all  stocks  on  the  NYSE  paid  a
so-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had declined
to less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See Harry DeAn-
gelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special Dividends and the
Evolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57, no.
3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most plausible explanation for this
decline  is  that  corporate  managers  became  uncomfortable  with  the  idea
that  shareholders  might  interpret  special  dividends  as  a  signal  that  future
profits might be low.
† The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and Franco
Modigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valua-
tion of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in Economics. Miller
and Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were irrelevant, since an
investor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and a
rising stock price, or through a rising stock price alone, so long as the total
return is the same in either case.

ownership interest now embodied in his 105 shares. Nonetheless,
the change of form is actually one of real importance and value to
him.  If  he  wishes  to  cash  in  his  share  of  the  reinvested  profits  he
can do so by selling the new certificate sent him, instead of having
to break up his original certificate. He can count on receiving the
same  cash-dividend  rate  on  105  shares  as  formerly  on  his  100
shares; a 5% rise in the cash-dividend rate without the stock divi-
dend would not be nearly as probable.*

The  advantages  of  a  periodic  stock-dividend  policy  are  most
evident when it is compared with the usual practice of the public-
utility companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking
back  a  good  part  of  this  money  from  the  shareholders  by  selling
them additional stock (through subscription rights).† As we men-
tioned  above,  the  shareholders  would  find  themselves  in  exactly
the  same  position  if  they  received  stock  dividends  in  lieu  of  the
popular  combination  of  cash  dividends  followed  by  stock  sub-
scriptions—except that they would save the income tax otherwise
paid on the cash dividends. Those who need or wish the maximum
annual cash income, with no additional stock, can get this result by
selling their stock dividends, in the same way as they sell their sub-
scription rights under present practice.

The aggregate amount of income tax that could be saved by sub-
stituting  stock  dividends  for  the  present  stock-dividends-plus-
subscription-rights  combination  is  enormous.  We  urge  that  this

* Graham’s  argument  is  no  longer  valid,  and  today’s  investors  can  safely
skip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry about “having
to break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all shares now exist in elec-
tronic rather than paper form. And when Graham says that a 5% increase in
a cash dividend on 100 shares is less “probable” than a constant dividend
on 105 shares, it’s unclear how he could even calculate that probability.
† Subscription  rights,  often  simply  known  as  “rights,”  are  used  less  fre-
quently than in Graham’s day. They confer upon an existing shareholder the
right to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to market price. A share-
holder who does not participate will end up owning proportionately less of
the company. Thus, as is the case with so many other things that go by the
name of “rights,” some coercion is often involved. Rights are most common
today among closed-end funds and insurance or other holding companies.

change be made by the public utilities, despite its adverse effect on
the  U.S.  Treasury,  because  we  are  convinced  that  it  is  completely
inequitable to impose a second (personal) income tax on earnings
which are not really received by the shareholders, since the compa-
nies take the same money back through sales of stock.*

Efficient  corporations  continuously  modernize  their  facilities,
their products, their bookkeeping, their management-training pro-
grams, their employee relations. It is high time they thought about
modernizing their major financial practices, not the least important
of which is their dividend policy.

* The administration of President George W. Bush made progress in early
2003  toward  reducing  the  problem  of  double-taxation  of  corporate  divi-
dends, although it is too soon to know how helpful any final laws in this area
will turn out to be. A cleaner approach would be to make dividend payments
tax-deductible to the corporation, but that is not part of the proposed legis-
lation.

Perhaps no other part of The Intelligent Investor was more drastically
changed by Graham than this. In the first edition, this chapter was one
of a pair that together ran nearly 34 pages. That original section (“The
Investor  as  Business  Owner”)  dealt  with  shareholders’  voting  rights,
ways of judging the quality of corporate management, and techniques
for  detecting  conflicts  of  interest  between  insiders  and  outside
investors. By his last revised edition, however, Graham had pared the
whole discussion back to less than eight terse pages about dividends.
Why did Graham cut away more than three-quarters of his original
argument?  After  decades  of  exhortation,  he  evidently  had  given  up
hope  that  investors  would  ever  take  any  interest  in  monitoring  the
behavior of corporate managers.

But the latest epidemic of scandal—allegations of managerial mis-
behavior, shady accounting, or tax maneuvers at major firms like AOL,
Enron,  Global  Crossing,  Sprint,  Tyco,  and  WorldCom—is  a  stark
reminder  that  Graham’s  earlier  warnings  about  the  need  for  eternal
vigilance are more vital than ever. Let’s bring them back and discuss
them in light of today’s events.

T H E O R Y   V E R S U S   P R A C T I C E

Graham begins his original (1949) discussion of “The Investor as Busi-
ness Owner” by pointing out that, in theory, “the stockholders as a class
are king. Acting as a majority they can hire and fire managements and
bend them completely to their will.” But, in practice, says Graham,

497

the shareholders are a complete washout. As a class they show nei-
ther  intelligence  nor  alertness.  They  vote  in  sheeplike  fashion  for
whatever the management recommends and no matter how poor the
management’s record of accomplishment may be. . . . The only way to
inspire the average American shareholder to take any independently
intelligent action would be by exploding a firecracker under him. . . .
We cannot resist pointing out the paradoxical fact that Jesus seems
to have been a more practical businessman than are American share-
holders.1

Graham  wants  you  to  realize  something  basic  but  incredibly  pro-
found: When you buy a stock, you become an owner of the company.
Its  managers,  all  the  way  up  to  the  CEO,  work  for  you.  Its  board  of
directors must answer to you. Its cash belongs to you. Its businesses
are  your  property.  If  you  don’t  like  how  your  company  is  being  man-
aged,  you  have  the  right  to  demand  that  the  managers  be  fired,  the
directors  be  changed,  or  the  property  be  sold.  “Stockholders,”
declares Graham, “should wake up.” 2

1 Benjamin  Graham,  The  Intelligent  Investor (Harper  &  Row,  New  York,
1949), pp. 217, 219, 240. Graham explains his reference to Jesus this way:
“In at least four parables in the Gospels there is reference to a highly critical
relationship  between  a  man  of  wealth  and  those  he  puts  in  charge  of  his
property. Most to the point are the words that “a certain rich man” speaks to
his  steward  or  manager,  who  is  accused  of  wasting  his  goods:  ‘Give  an
account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward.’ (Luke,
16:2).” Among the other parables Graham seems to have in mind is Matt.,
25:15–28.
2 Benjamin  Graham,  “A  Questionnaire  on  Stockholder-Management  Rela-
tionship,” The Analysts Journal, Fourth Quarter, 1947, p. 62. Graham points
out that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional security ana-
lysts and found that more than 95% of them believed that shareholders have
the  right  to  call  for  a  formal  investigation  of  managers  whose  leadership
does  not  enhance  the  value  of  the  stock.  Graham  adds  dryly  that  “such
action is almost unheard of in practice.” This, he says, “highlights the wide
gulf  between  what  should  happen  and  what  does  happen  in  shareholder-
management relationships.”

Today’s investors have forgotten Graham’s message. They put most of
their effort into buying a stock, a little into selling it—but none into own-
ing it. “Certainly,” Graham reminds us, “there is just as much reason to
exercise care and judgment in being as in becoming a stockholder.” 3

So  how  should  you,  as  an  intelligent  investor,  go  about  being  an
intelligent owner? Graham starts by telling us that “there are just two
basic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention:

1. Is the management reasonably efficient?

proper recognition?” 4

You should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each
company’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firms
in its industry. What if you conclude that the managers are no good?
Then, urges Graham,

A few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced
that  a  change  is  needed  and  should  be  willing  to  work  toward  that
end.  Second,  the  rank  and  file  of  the  stockholders  should  be  open-
minded  enough  to  read  the  proxy  material  and  to  weigh  the  argu-
ments on both sides. They must at least be able to know when their
company has been unsuccessful and be ready to demand more than
artful platitudes as a vindication of the incumbent management. Third,
it  would  be  most  helpful,  when  the  figures  clearly  show  that  the
results are well below average, if it became the custom to call in out-
side business engineers to pass upon the policies and competence
of the management.5

to  the  board  of  directors.  However,  the  company  would  bear  the  costs  of

Back in 1999, Enron Corp. ranked seventh on the Fortune 500
list  of  America’s  top  companies.  The  energy  giant’s  revenues,
assets, and earnings were all rising like rockets.

But what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering
numbers—and  had  simply  put  Enron’s  1999  proxy  statement
under  the  microscope  of  common  sense?  Under  the  heading
“Certain  Transactions,”  the  proxy  disclosed  that  Enron’s  chief
financial  officer,  Andrew  Fastow,  was  the  “managing  member”
of two partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, that bought “energy and
communications  related  investments.”  And  where  was  LJM1
and LJM2 buying from? Why, where else but from Enron! The
proxy  reported  that  the  partnerships  had  already  bought  $170
million of assets from Enron—sometimes using money borrowed
from Enron.

The intelligent investor would immediately have asked:

• Did  Enron’s  directors  approve  this  arrangement?  (Yes,  said

the proxy.)

• Would  Fastow  get  a  piece  of  LJM’s  profits?  (Yes,  said  the

proxy.)

• As Enron’s chief financial officer, was Fastow obligated to act
exclusively  in  the  interests  of  Enron’s  shareholders?  (Of
course.)

• Was  Fastow  therefore  duty-bound  to  maximize  the  price

Enron obtained for any assets it sold? (Absolutely.)

• But  if  LJM  paid  a  high  price  for  Enron’s  assets,  would  that
lower  LJM’s  potential  profits—and  Fastow’s  personal
income? (Clearly.)

• On the other hand, if LJM paid a low price, would that raise
profits  for  Fastow  and  his  partnerships,  but  hurt  Enron’s
income? (Clearly.)

• Should Enron lend Fastow’s partnerships any money to buy
assets  from  Enron  that  might  generate  a  personal  profit  for
Fastow? (Say what?!)

• Doesn’t  all  this  constitute  profoundly  disturbing  conflicts  of

interest? (No other answer is even possible.)

• What does this arrangement say about the judgment of the
directors  who  approved  it?  (It  says  you  should  take  your
investment dollars elsewhere.)

Two  clear  lessons  emerge  from  this  disaster:  Never  dig  so
deep  into  the  numbers  that  you  check  your  common  sense  at
the door, and always read the proxy statement before (and after)
you buy a stock.

What is “proxy material” and why does Graham insist that you read
it? In its proxy statement, which it sends to every shareholder, a com-
pany  announces  the  agenda  for  its  annual  meeting  and  discloses
details  about  the  compensation  and  stock  ownership  of  managers
and directors, along with transactions between insiders and the com-
pany. Shareholders are asked to vote on which accounting firm should
audit the books and who should serve on the board of directors. If you
use your common sense while reading the proxy, this document can
be like a canary in a coal mine—an early warning system signaling that
something is wrong. (See the Enron sidebar above.)

Yet, on average, between a third and a half of all individual investors

cannot be bothered to vote their proxies.6 Do they even read them?

Understanding and voting your proxy is as every bit as fundamental

(cont’d from p. 499) Graham had in mind were money managers, rating agen-
cies  and  organizations  of  security  analysts.  Today,  investors  could  choose
from among hundreds of consulting firms, restructuring advisers, and mem-
bers of entities like the Risk Management Association.
6 Tabulations  of  voting  results  for  2002  by  Georgeson  Shareholder  and
ADP’s Investor Communication Services, two leading firms that mail proxy
solicitations to investors, suggest response rates that average around 80%
to 88% (including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their clients,
which  are  automatically  voted  in  favor  of  management  unless  the  clients
specify otherwise). Thus the owners of between 12% and 20% of all shares
are not voting their proxies. Since individuals own only 40% of U.S. shares
by  market  value,  and  most  institutional  investors  like  pension  funds  and
insurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy issues, that means
that roughly a third of all individual investors are neglecting to vote.

to being an intelligent investor as following the news and voting your
conscience is to being a good citizen. It doesn’t matter whether you
own  10%  of  a  company  or,  with  your  piddling  100  shares,  just
1/10.000  of  1%.  If  you’ve  never  read  the  proxy  of  a  stock  you  own,
and  the  company  goes  bust,  the  only  person  you  should  blame  is
yourself. If you do read the proxy and see things that disturb you, then:

attend the annual meeting and speak up for your rights

cause.

Graham had another idea that could benefit today’s investors:

. . . there are advantages to be gained through the selection of one or
more professional and independent directors. These should be men
of wide business experience who can turn a fresh and expert eye on
the  problems  of  the  enterprise. . . . They  should  submit  a  separate
annual report, addressed directly to the stockholders and containing
their views on the major question which concerns the owners of the
enterprise: “Is the business showing the results for the outside stock-
holder  which  could  be  expected  of  it  under  proper  management?  If
not, why—and what should be done about it?7

One  can  only  imagine  the  consternation  that  Graham’s  proposal
would cause among the corporate cronies and golfing buddies who
constitute so many of today’s “independent” directors. (Let’s not sug-
gest that it might send a shudder of fear down their spines, since most
independent directors do not appear to have a backbone.)

W H O S E   M O N E Y   I S   I T ,   A N Y W A Y ?

Now  let’s  look  at  Graham’s  second  criterion—whether  management
acts in the best interests of outside investors. Managers have always
told shareholders that they—the managers—know best what to do with

7 1949 edition, p. 224.

the  company’s  cash.  Graham  saw  right  through  this  managerial
malarkey:

A company’s management may run the business well and yet not give
the  outside  stockholders  the  right  results  for  them,  because  its  effi-
ciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use
of the capital. The objective of efficient operation is to produce at low
cost and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance
requires that the stockholders’ money be working in forms most suit-
able to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such,
has little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital from
the owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own financial
problems. Thus the typical management will operate with more capital
than necessary, if the stockholders permit it—which they often do.8

In  the  late  1990s  and  into  the  early  2000s,  the  managements  of
leading technology companies took this “Daddy-Knows-Best” attitude
to  new  extremes.  The  argument  went  like  this:  Why  should  you
demand a dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn it
into  a  rising  share  price?  Just  look  at  the  way  our  stock  has  been
going up—doesn’t that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollars
better than you can?

Incredibly, investors fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Daddy Knows
Best became such gospel that, by 1999, only 3.7% of the companies
that first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividend—down
from an average of 72.1% of all IPOs in the 1960s.9 Just look at how

has shrunk by nearly two-thirds. See Harry DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and

But Daddy Knows Best was nothing but bunk. While some compa-
nies put their cash to good use, many more fell into two other cate-
gories: those that simply wasted it, and those that piled it up far faster
than they could possibly spend it.

In  the  first  group,  Priceline.com  wrote  off  $67  million  in  losses  in

 
 
 
 
Commentary on Chapter 19

2000 after launching goofy ventures into groceries and gasoline, while
Amazon.com  destroyed  at  least  $233  million  of  its  shareholders’
wealth  by  “investing”  in  dot-bombs  like  Webvan  and  Ashford.com.10
And the two biggest losses so far on record—JDS Uniphase’s $56 bil-
lion  in  2001  and  AOL  Time  Warner’s  $99  billion  in  2002—occurred
after companies chose not to pay dividends but to merge with other
firms at a time when their shares were obscenely overvalued.11

In the second group, consider that by late 2001, Oracle Corp. had
piled up $5 billion in cash. Cisco Systems had hoarded at least $7.5
billion. Microsoft had amassed a mountain of cash $38.2 billion high—
and rising by an average of more than $2 million per hour.12 Just how
rainy a day was Bill Gates expecting, anyway?

So  the  anecdotal  evidence  clearly  shows  that  many  companies

10 Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, who is said to have carried his coins around in
an asbestos purse so that money wouldn’t burn a hole in his pocket, could
have avoided this problem if he had been a CEO.
11 A study by BusinessWeek found that from 1995 through 2001, 61% out
of more than 300 large mergers ended up destroying wealth for the share-
holders  of  the  acquiring  company—a  condition  known  as  “the  winner’s
curse” or “buyer’s remorse.” And acquirers using stock rather than cash to
pay  for  the  deal  underperformed  rival  companies  by  8%.  (David  Henry,
“Mergers: Why Most Big Deals Don’t Pay Off,” BusinessWeek, October 14,
2002, pp. 60–70.) A similar academic study found that acquisitions of pri-
vate companies and subsidiaries of public companies lead to positive stock
returns, but that acquisitions of entire public companies generate losses for
the winning bidder’s shareholders. (Kathleen Fuller, Jeffry Netter, and Mike
Stegemoller, “What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell Us?” The Journal of
Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1763–1793.)
12 With interest rates near record lows, such a mountain of cash produces
lousy returns if it just sits around. As Graham asserts, “So long as this sur-
plus cash remains with the company, the outside stockholder gets little ben-
efit from it” (1949 edition, p. 232). Indeed, by year-end 2002, Microsoft’s
cash  balance  had  swollen  to  $43.4  billion—clear  proof  that  the  company
could  find  no  good  use  for  the  cash  its  businesses  were  generating.  As
Graham would say, Microsoft’s operations were efficient, but its finance no
longer was. In a step toward redressing this problem, Microsoft declared in
early 2003 that it would begin paying a regular quarterly dividend.

don’t know how to turn excess cash into extra returns. What does the
statistical evidence tell us?

•

•

Research by money managers Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness
found that when current dividends are low, future corporate earn-
ings also turn out to be low. And when current dividends are high,
so are future earnings. Over 10-year periods, the average rate of
earnings  growth  was  3.9  points  greater  when  dividends  were
high than when they were low.13
Columbia  accounting  professors  Doron  Nissim  and  Amir  Ziv
found that companies that raise their dividend not only have better
stock  returns  but  that  “dividend  increases  are  associated  with
[higher] future profitability for at least four years after the dividend
change.” 14

In short, most managers are wrong when they say that they can put
your cash to better use than you can. Paying out a dividend does not
guarantee great results, but it does improve the return of the typical
stock  by  yanking  at  least  some  cash  out  of  the  managers’  hands
before they can either squander it or squirrel it away.

What about the argument that companies can put spare cash to bet-
ter  use  by  buying  back  their  own  shares?  When  a  company  repur-
chases  some  of  its  stock,  that  reduces  the  number  of  its  shares
outstanding. Even if its net income stays flat, the company’s earnings

Even researchers who disagree with the Arnott-Asness and Nissim-Ziv find-
ings on future earnings agree that dividend increases lead to higher future
stock returns; see Shlomo Benartzi, Roni Michaely, and Richard Thaler, “Do
Changes  in  Dividends  Signal  the  Future  or  the  Past?”  The  Journal  of
Finance, vol. 52, no. 3, July, 1997, pp. 1007–1034.

per share will rise, since its total earnings will be spread across fewer
shares. That, in turn, should lift the stock price. Better yet, unlike a div-
idend, a buyback is tax-free to investors who don’t sell their shares.15
Thus it increases the value of their stock without raising their tax bill.
And if the shares are cheap, then spending spare cash to repurchase
them is an excellent use of the company’s capital.16

All this is true in theory. Unfortunately, in the real world, stock buy-
backs have come to serve a purpose that can only be described as
sinister. Now that grants of stock options have become such a large
part of executive compensation, many companies—especially in high-
tech  industries—must  issue  hundreds  of  millions  of  shares  to  give  to
the managers who exercise those stock options.17 But that would jack

15 The  tax  reforms  proposed  by  President  George  W.  Bush  in  early  2003
would change the taxability of dividends, but the fate of this legislation was
not yet clear by press time.
16 Historically,  companies  took  a  common-sense  approach  toward  share
repurchases,  reducing  them  when  stock  prices  were  high  and  stepping
them up when prices were low. After the stock market crash of October 19,
1987, for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next
12 days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in
the earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher. See
Murali Jagannathan, Clifford P. Stephens, and Michael S. Weisbach, “Finan-
cial Flexibility and the Choice Between Dividends and Stock Repurchases,”
Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September, 2000, p. 362.
17 The stock options granted by a company to its executives and employees
give them the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in the future at a
discounted price. That conversion of options to shares is called “exercising”
the options. The employees can then sell the shares at the current market
price and pocket the difference as profit. Because hundreds of millions of
options  may  be  exercised  in  a  given  year,  the  company  must  increase  its
supply  of  shares  outstanding.  Then,  however,  the  company’s  total  net
income would be spread across a much greater number of shares, reducing
its earnings per share. Therefore, the company typically feels compelled to
buy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders.
In  1998,  63.5%  of  chief  financial  officers  admitted  that  counteracting  the
dilution from options was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFO
Forum, “The Buyback Track,” Institutional Investor, July, 1998).

508

Commentary on Chapter 19

up the number of shares outstanding and shrink earnings per share.
To counteract that dilution, the companies must turn right back around
and repurchase millions of shares in the open market. By 2000, com-
panies were spending an astounding 41.8% of their total net income
to repurchase their own shares—up from 4.8% in 1980.18

Let’s  look  at  Oracle  Corp.,  the  software  giant.  Between  June  1,
1999, and May 31, 2000, Oracle issued 101 million shares of com-
mon stock to its senior executives and another 26 million to employ-
ees  at  a  cost  of  $484  million.  Meanwhile,  to  keep  the  exercise  of
earlier stock options from diluting its earnings per share, Oracle spent
$5.3 billion—or 52% of its total revenues that year—to buy back 290.7
million shares of stock. Oracle issued the stock to insiders at an aver-
age price of $3.53 per share and repurchased it at an average price of
$18.26. Sell low, buy high: Is this any way to “enhance” shareholder
value?19

By  2002,  Oracle’s  stock  had  fallen  to  less  than  half  its  peak  in
2000.  Now  that  its  shares  were  cheaper,  did  Oracle  hasten  to  buy
back more stock? Between June 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, Oracle
cut its repurchases to $2.8 billion, apparently because its executives
and employees exercised fewer options that year. The same sell-low,
buy-high pattern is evident at dozens of other technology companies.

What’s going on here? Two surprising factors are at work:

18 One of the main factors driving this change was the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s decision, in 1982, to relax its previous restrictions
on share repurchases. See Gustavo Grullon and Roni Michaely, “Dividends,
Share  Repurchases,  and  the  Substitution  Hypothesis,”  The  Journal  of
Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1649–1684.
19 Throughout  his  writings,  Graham  insists  that  corporate  managements
have a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued, but also to
make sure it never gets overvalued. As he put it in Security Analysis (1934
ed., p. 515), “the responsibility of managements to act in the interest of their
shareholders includes the obligation to prevent—in so far as they are able—
the establishment of either absurdly high or unduly low prices for their secu-
rities.”  Thus,  enhancing  shareholder  value  doesn’t  just  mean  making  sure
that  the  stock  price  does  not  go  too  low;  it  also  means  ensuring  that  the
stock price does not go up to unjustifiable levels. If only the executives of
Internet companies had heeded Graham’s wisdom back in 1999!

Companies get a tax break when executives and employees exer-
cise  stock  options  (which  the  IRS  considers  a  “compensation
expense” to the company).20 In its fiscal years from 2000 through
2002, for example, Oracle reaped $1.69 billion in tax benefits as
insiders cashed in on options. Sprint Corp. pocketed $678 million
in tax benefits as its executives and employees locked in $1.9 bil-
lion in options profits in 1999 and 2000.
A senior executive heavily compensated with stock options has a
vested interest in favoring stock buybacks over dividends. Why?
For technical reasons, options increase in value as the price fluc-
tuations of a stock grow more extreme. But dividends dampen the
volatility of a stock’s price. So, if the managers increased the divi-
dend, they would lower the value of their own stock options.21

No wonder CEOs would much rather buy back stock than pay divi-
dends—regardless of how overvalued the shares may be or how dras-
tically that may waste the resources of the outside shareholders.

20 Incredibly, although options are considered a compensation expense on a
company’s tax returns, they are not counted as an expense on the income
statement in financial reports to shareholders. Investors can only hope that
accounting reforms will change this ludicrous practice.
21 See  George  W.  Fenn  and  Nellie  Liang,  “Corporate  Payout  Policy  and
Managerial Stock Incentives,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60, no. 1,
April, 2001, pp. 45–72. Dividends make stocks less volatile by providing a
stream of current income that cushions shareholders against fluctuations in
market value. Several researchers have found that the average profitability of
companies with stock-buyback programs (but no cash dividends) is at least
twice as volatile as that of companies that pay dividends. Those more vari-
able earnings will, in general, lead to bouncier share prices, making the man-
agers’  stock  options  more  valuable—by  creating  more  opportunities  when
share  prices  will  be  temporarily  high.  Today,  about  two-thirds  of  executive
compensation  comes  in  the  form  of  options  and  other  noncash  awards;
thirty years ago, at least two-thirds of compensation came as cash.

Finally, drowsy investors have given their companies free rein to over-
pay executives in ways that are simply unconscionable. In 1997, Steve
Jobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the company
as  its  “interim”  chief  executive  officer.  Already  a  wealthy  man,  Jobs
insisted on taking a cash salary of $1 per year. At year-end 1999, to
thank Jobs for serving as CEO “for the previous 2 1/2 years without
compensation,” the board presented him with his very own Gulfstream
jet, at a cost to the company of a mere $90 million. The next month
Jobs  agreed  to  drop  “interim”  from  his  job  title,  and  the  board
rewarded him with options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs had
held a grand total of two shares of Apple stock.)

The principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of
managers  with  outside  investors.  If  you  are  an  outside  Apple  share-
holder,  you  want  its  managers  to  be  rewarded  only  if  Apple’s  stock
earns superior returns. Nothing else could possibly be fair to you and
the other owners of the company. But, as John Bogle, former chairman
of the Vanguard funds, points out, nearly all managers sell the stock
they  receive  immediately  after  exercising  their  options.  How  could
dumping  millions  of  shares  for  an  instant  profit  possibly  align  their
interests with those of the company’s loyal long-term shareholders?

In Jobs’ case, if Apple stock rises by just 5% annually through the
beginning of 2010, he will be able to cash in his options for $548.3
million. In other words, even if Apple’s stock earns no better than half
the long-term average return of the overall stock market, Jobs will land
a half-a-billion dollar windfall.22 Does that align his interests with those
of Apple’s shareholders—or malign the trust that Apple’s shareholders
have placed in the board of directors?

Reading proxy statements vigilantly, the intelligent owner will vote
against  any  executive  compensation  plan  that  uses  option  grants  to
turn more than 3% of the company’s shares outstanding over to the
managers. And you should veto any plan that does not make option
grants contingent on a fair and enduring measure of superior results—

Let’s go back to Graham’s suggestion that every company’s indepen-
dent board members should have to report to the shareholders in writ-
ing on whether the business is properly managed on behalf of its true
owners.  What  if  the  independent  directors  also  had  to  justify  the
company’s policies on dividends and share repurchases? What if they
had to describe exactly how they determined that the company’s sen-
ior management was not overpaid? And what if every investor became

“Margin of Safety” as the 

Central Concept of Investment

In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of
mortal  affairs  into  the  single  phrase,  “This  too  will  pass.”*  Con-
fronted  with  a  like  challenge  to  distill  the  secret  of  sound  invest-
ment  into  three  words,  we  venture  the  motto,  MARGIN  OF
SAFETY. This is the thread that runs through all the preceding dis-
cussion of investment policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less
direct  fashion.  Let  us  try  now,  briefly,  to  trace  that  idea  in  a  con-
nected argument.

All  experienced  investors  recognize  that  the  margin-of-safety
concept  is  essential  to  the  choice  of  sound  bonds  and  preferred
stocks.  For  example,  a  railroad  should  have  earned  its  total  fixed
charges better than five times (before income tax), taking a period
of years, for its bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This
past ability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the
margin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against
loss  or  discomfiture  in  the  event  of  some  future decline  in  net
income. (The margin above charges may be stated in other ways—

* “It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a
sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all
times  and  situations.  They  presented  him  the  words:  ‘And  this,  too,  shall
pass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—
how consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And this, too, shall pass away.’ And
yet let us hope it is not quite true.”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wis-
consin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abra-
ham  Lincoln:  Speeches  and  Writings,  1859–1865 (Library  of  America,
1985), vol. II, p. 101.

for  example,  in  the  percentage  by  which  revenues  or  profits  may
decline before the balance after interest disappears—but the under-
lying idea remains the same.)

The  bond  investor  does  not  expect  future  average  earnings  to
work out the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin
demanded  might  be  small.  Nor  does  he  rely  to  any  controlling
extent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate-
rially better or poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have
to  measure  his  margin  in  terms  of  a  carefully  projected income
account,  instead  of  emphasizing  the  margin  shown  in  the  past
record. Here the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that
of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the
margin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earn-
ings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor
to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.

The margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively,
by comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of
debt.  (A similar  calculation  may  be  made  for  a  preferred-stock
issue.) If the business owes $10 million and is fairly worth $30 mil-
lion, there is room for a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least
theoretically—before the bondholders will suffer loss. The amount
of this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-
mated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues
over  a  period  of  years.  Since  average  stock  prices  are  generally
related to average earning power, the margin of “enterprise value”
over  debt  and  the  margin  of  earnings  over  charges  will  in  most
cases yield similar results.

So much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-
value investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common
stocks? Yes, but with some necessary modifications.

There are instances where a common stock may be considered
sound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good
bond. This will occur, for example, when a company has outstand-
ing only common stock that under depression conditions is selling
for  less  than  the  amount  of  bonds  that  could  safely  be  issued
against its property and earning power.* That was the position of a

* “Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential profits or, as
he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to earn year after year

host of strongly financed industrial companies at the low price lev-
els of 1932–33. In such instances the investor can obtain the margin
of  safety  associated  with  a  bond,  plus all  the  chances  of  larger
income  and  principal  appreciation  inherent  in  a  common  stock.
(The  only  thing  he  lacks  is  the  legal  power  to  insist  on  dividend
payments  “or  else”—but  this  is  a  small  drawback  as  compared
with his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such circum-
stances  will  supply  an  ideal,  though  infrequent,  combination  of
safety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this con-
dition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,
which sold for a total enterprise value of $43 million in 1972. With
its $16 millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could
easily have supported this amount of bonds.

In  the  ordinary  common  stock,  bought  for  investment  under
normal conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning
power considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former edi-
tions we elucidated this point with the following figures:

Assume  in  a  typical  case  that  the  earning  power  is  9%  on  the
price and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have
an average annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the
excess is paid to him in the dividend rate; even though spent by
him, it enters into his overall investment result. The undistributed
balance is reinvested in the business for his account. In many cases
such reinvested earnings fail to add commensurately to the earn-
ing  power  and  value  of  his  stock.  (That  is  why  the  market  has  a
stubborn  habit  of  valuing  earnings  disbursed  in  dividends  more
generously than the portion retained in the business.)* But, if the
picture is viewed as a whole, there is a reasonably close connection

if  the  business  conditions  prevailing  during  the  period  were  to  continue
unchanged”  (Security  Analysis, 1934  ed.,  p.  354).  Some  of  his  lectures
make it clear that Graham intended the term to cover periods of five years or
more.  You  can  crudely  but  conveniently  approximate  a  company’s  earning
power per share by taking the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with
a P/E ratio of 11 can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by
11). Today “earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”
* This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on Chapter 19.

between  the  growth  of  corporate  surpluses  through  reinvested
earnings and the growth of corporate values.

Over  a  ten-year  period  the  typical  excess  of  stock  earning
power  over  bond  interest  may  aggregate  50%  of  the  price  paid.
This figure is sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—
which,  under  favorable  conditions,  will  prevent  or  minimize  a
loss.  If  such  a  margin  is  present  in  each  of  a  diversified  list  of
twenty or more stocks, the probability of a favorable result under
“fairly  normal  conditions”  becomes  very  large.  That  is  why  the
policy  of  investing  in  representative  common  stocks  does  not
require high qualities of insight and foresight to work out success-
fully. If the purchases are made at the average level of the market
over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assur-
ance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies
in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,
or  in  buying  nonrepresentative  common  stocks  that  carry  more
than average risk of diminished earning power.

As  we  see  it,  the  whole  problem  of  common-stock  investment
under  1972  conditions  lies  in  the  fact  that  “in  a  typical  case”  the
earning power is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let us
assume  that  by  concentrating  somewhat  on  the  low-multiplier
issues  among  the  large  companies  a  defensive  investor  may  now

* Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a lecture he
gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between the percent-
age rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate
of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is the difference which would
absorb  unsatisfactory  developments.  At  the  time  the  1965  edition  of  The
Intelligent  Investor was  written  the  typical  stock  was  selling  at  11  times
earnings, giving about 9% return as against 4% on bonds. In that case you
had a margin of safety of over 100 per cent. Now [in 1972] there is no dif-
ference between the earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks,
and  I  say  there  is  no  margin  of  safety . . . you  have  a  negative  margin  of
safety on stocks . . .” See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analy-
sis”  [transcript  of  lecture  at  the  Northeast  Missouri  State  University  busi-
ness school, March, 1972], Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.

acquire equities at 12 times recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings
return of 8.33% on cost. He may obtain a dividend yield of about
4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost reinvested in the business for
his account. On this basis, the excess of stock earning power over
bond interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to con-
stitute  an  adequate  margin  of  safety.  For  that  reason  we  feel  that
there are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound common
stocks.  The  risks  may  be  fully  offset  by  the  profit  possibilities  of 
the list; and indeed the investor may have no choice but to incur
them—for  otherwise  he  may  run  an  even  greater  risk  of  holding
only  fixed  claims  payable  in  steadily  depreciating  dollars.  None-
theless  the  investor  would  do  well  to  recognize,  and  to  accept 
as  philosophically  as  he  can,  that  the  old  package  of  good  profit 
possibilities  combined  with  small  ultimate  risk is  no  longer  available 
to him.*

However,  the  risk  of  paying  too  high  a  price  for  good-quality
stocks—while  a  real  one—is  not  the  chief  hazard  confronting  the
average  buyer  of  securities.  Observation  over  many  years  has
taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase
of low-quality securities  at  times  of  favorable  business  conditions.
The  purchasers  view  the  current  good  earnings  as  equivalent  to
“earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous with
safety. It is in those years that bonds and preferred stocks of infe-
rior grade can be sold to the public at a price around par, because
they carry a little higher income return or a deceptively attractive
conversion  privilege.  It  is  then,  also,  that  common  stocks  of
obscure companies can be floated at prices far above the tangible
investment,  on  the  strength  of  two  or  three  years  of  excellent
growth.

These securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any
admissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and pre-
ferred dividends must be tested over a number of years, including
preferably a period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The
same  is  ordinarily  true  of  common-stock  earnings  if  they  are  to

cise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more detail, see the

qualify as indicators of earning power. Thus it follows that most of
the  fair-weather  investments,  acquired  at  fair-weather  prices,  are
destined  to  suffer  disturbing  price  declines  when  the  horizon
clouds  over—and  often  sooner  than  that.  Nor  can  the  investor
count  with  confidence  on  an  eventual  recovery—although  this
does come about in some proportion of the cases—for he has never
had a real safety margin to tide him through adversity.

The philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part
and  in  part  contravenes  the  margin-of-safety  principle.  The
growth-stock  buyer  relies  on  an  expected  earning  power  that  is
greater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to
substitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating
his margin of safety. In investment theory there is no reason why
carefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guide
than the bare record of the past; in fact, security analysis is coming
more and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of the
future. Thus the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable
a  margin  of  safety  as  is  found  in  the  ordinary  investment—
provided the calculation of the future is conservatively made, and
provided  it  shows  a  satisfactory  margin  in  relation  to  the  price
paid.

The  danger  in  a  growth-stock  program  lies  precisely  here.  For
such  favored  issues  the  market  has  a  tendency  to  set  prices  that
will  not  be  adequately  protected  by  a  conservative projection  of
future  earnings.  (It  is  a  basic  rule  of  prudent  investment  that  all
estimates,  when  they  differ  from  past  performance,  must  err  at
least slightly on the side of understatement.) The margin of safety
is always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price,
small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price. If,
as  we  suggest,  the  average  market  level  of  most  growth  stocks  is
too  high  to  provide  an  adequate  margin  of  safety  for  the  buyer,
then a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not
work out satisfactorily. A special degree of foresight and judgment
will be needed, in order that wise individual selections may over-
come  the  hazards  inherent  in  the  customary  market  level  of  such
issues as a whole.

The  margin-of-safety  idea  becomes  much  more  evident  when
we  apply  it  to  the  field  of  undervalued  or  bargain  securities.  We
have  here,  by  definition,  a  favorable  difference  between  price  on

518

The Intelligent Investor

the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That
difference  is  the  safety  margin.  It  is  available  for  absorbing  the
effect of miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of
bargain  issues  places  particular  emphasis  on  the  ability  of  the
investment to withstand adverse developments. For in most such
cases  he  has  no  real  enthusiasm  about  the  company’s  prospects.
True, if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to
avoid  the  security  no  matter  how  low  the  price.  But  the  field  of
undervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns—perhaps a
majority  of  the  total—for  which  the  future  appears  neither  dis-
tinctly  promising  nor  distinctly  unpromising.  If  these  are  bought
on a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power
need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results.
The margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.

Theory of Diversification

There  is  a  close  logical  connection  between  the  concept  of  a
safety  margin  and  the  principle  of  diversification.  One  is  correla-
tive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an
individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees
only  that  he  has  a  better  chance  for  profit  than  for  loss—not  that
loss  is  impossible.  But  as  the  number  of  such  commitments  is
increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the
profits  will  exceed  the  aggregate  of  the  losses.  That  is  the  simple
basis of the insurance-underwriting business.

Diversification  is  an  established  tenet  of  conservative  invest-
ment.  By  accepting  it  so  universally,  investors  are  really  demon-
strating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which
diversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-
orful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 on
a  single  number,  he  is  paid  $35  profit  when  he  wins—but  the
chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin of
safety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he
bets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-
larly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain to
lose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received
$39 profit instead of $35. Then he would have a small but impor-
tant margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,

“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment

519

the better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning $2
on every spin by simply betting $1 each on all the numbers. (Inci-
dentally,  the  two  examples  given  actually  describe  the  respective
positions of the player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*

A Criterion of Investment versus Speculation

Since  there  is  no  single  definition  of  investment  in  general
acceptance,  authorities  have  the  right  to  define  it  pretty  much  as
they please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or depend-
able difference between the concepts of investment and of specula-
tion.  We  think  this  skepticism  is  unnecessary  and  harmful.  It  is
injurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of
many  people  toward  the  excitement  and  hazards  of  stock-market
speculation. We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be
used to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment
operation from a speculative one.

Probably  most  speculators  believe  they  have  the  odds  in  their
favor  when  they  take  their  chances,  and  therefore  they  may  lay
claim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-
ing that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is
superior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-
thy.  But  such  claims  are  unconvincing.  They  rest  on  subjective
judgment, unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any

* In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers
1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a maximum payout 
of 35 to 1. What if you bet $1 on every number? Since only one slot can 
be the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, but
lose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-
ence  (or  a  5.26%  spread  on  your  total  $38  bet)  is  the  casino’s  “house
advantage,” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will always lose more
than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as
possible,  it  is  in  the  casino’s  interest  to  keep  the  roulette  wheel  spinning.
Likewise,  the  intelligent  investor  should  seek  to  maximize  the  number  of
holdings  that  offer  “a  better  chance  for  profit  than  for  loss.”  For  most
investors,  diversification  is  the  simplest  and  cheapest  way  to  widen  your
margin of safety.

520

The Intelligent Investor

conclusive  line  of  reasoning.  We  greatly  doubt  whether  the  man
who  stakes  money  on  his  view  that  the  market  is  heading  up  or
down can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any
useful sense of the phrase.

By  contrast,  the  investor’s  concept  of  the  margin  of  safety—as
developed  earlier  in  this  chapter—rests  upon  simple  and  definite
arithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it
is well supported by practical investment experience. There is no
guarantee  that  this  fundamental  quantitative  approach  will  con-
tinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions of
the future. But, equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on
this score.

Thus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must
be present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is
one that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning,
and by reference to a body of actual experience.

Extension of the Concept of Investment

To complete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we
must  now  make  a  further  distinction  between  conventional  and
unconventional investments. Conventional investments are appro-
priate  for  the  typical  portfolio.  Under  this  heading  have  always
come United States government issues and high-grade, dividend-
paying common stocks. We have added state and municipal bonds
for those who will benefit sufficiently by their tax-exempt features.
Also included are first-quality corporate bonds when, as now, they
can be bought to yield sufficiently more than United States savings
bonds.

Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for
the  enterprising  investor.  They  cover  a  wide  range.  The  broadest
category is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com-
panies,  which  we  recommend  for  purchase  when  they  can  be
bought at two-thirds or less of their indicated value. Besides these,
there is often a wide choice of medium-grade corporate bonds and
preferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as
to be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent
value. In these cases the average investor would be inclined to call
the securities speculative, because in his mind their lack of a first-
quality rating is synonymous with a lack of investment merit.

“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment

521

It is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a secu-
rity  of  mediocre  quality  into  a  sound  investment  opportunity—
provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he
practices adequate diversification. For, if the price is low enough to
create a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our
criterion  of  investment.  Our  favorite  supporting  illustration  is
taken  from  the  field  of  real-estate  bonds.  In  the  1920s,  billions  of
dollars’ worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom-
mended  as  sound  investments.  A large  proportion  had  so  little
margin  of  value  over  debt  as  to  be  in  fact  highly  speculative  in
character. In the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of
these bonds defaulted their interest, and their price collapsed—in
some  cases  below  10  cents  on  the  dollar.  At  that  stage  the  same
advisers  who  had  recommended  them  at  par  as  safe  investments
were rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac-
tive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90%
made  many  of  these  securities  exceedingly  attractive  and  reason-
ably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times
the market quotation.*

The  fact  that  the  purchase  of  these  bonds  actually  resulted  in
what is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent
them from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The
“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made
an  unusually  shrewd  investment.  They  could  properly  be  called
investment opportunities,  since  a  careful  analysis  would  have
shown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin
of safety. Thus the very class of “fair-weather investments” which
we stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naïve security
buyers  is  likely  to  afford  many  sound  profit  opportunities  to  the
sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his
own price.†

* Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock; there
are  only  cheap  stocks  and  expensive  stocks.  Even  the  best  company
becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the worst com-
pany is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.
† The  very  people  who  considered  technology  and  telecommunications
stocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were hellishly
overpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even (cont’d on p. 522)

522

The Intelligent Investor

The  whole  field  of  “special  situations”  would  come  under  our
definition  of  investment  operations,  because  the  purchase  is
always  predicated  on  a  thoroughgoing  analysis  that  promises  a
larger realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors in
each individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations
and absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.

To carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest
that a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying
such intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-
stock  option  warrants”  selling  at  historically  low  prices.  (This
example is intended as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value
of  these  warrants  rests  on  the  possibility  that  the  related  stocks
may  some  day  advance  above  the  option  price.  At  the  moment
they  have  no  exercisable  value.  Yet,  since  all  investment  rests  on
reasonable future expectations, it is proper to view these warrants
in terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull market
will  create  a  large  increase  in  their  indicated  value  and  in  their
price.  Such  a  study  might  well  yield  the  conclusion  that  there  is
much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and
that the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of
an ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even

(cont’d  from  p.  521) though,  in  Graham’s  exact  words  from  an  earlier
period, “the price depreciation of about 90% made many of these securities
exceedingly attractive and reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts
have always tended to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and
to label it a “sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Gra-
ham (and simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the
book,  Graham  is  distinguishing  speculation—or  buying  on  the  hope  that  a
stock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis of
what the underlying business is worth.
* Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for “warrant,”
a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder a right to pur-
chase the company’s stock at a predetermined price. Warrants have been
almost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham quips that he intends
the  example  as  a  “shocker”  because,  even  in  his  day,  warrants  were
regarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters. (See the commentary
on Chapter 16.)

in  this  unprepossessing  security  form.  A sufficiently  enterprising
investor  could  then  include  an  option-warrant  operation  in  his
miscellany of unconventional investments.1

To Sum Up

Investment  is  most  intelligent  when  it  is  most businesslike. It  is
amazing  to  see  how  many  capable  businessmen  try  to  operate  in
Wall  Street  with  complete  disregard  of  all  the  sound  principles
through  which  they  have  gained  success  in  their  own  undertak-
ings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first
instance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specific
business enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits from
security  purchases  and  sales,  he  is  embarking  on  a  business  ven-
ture  of  his  own,  which  must  be  run  in  accordance  with  accepted
business principles if it is to have a chance of success.

The  first  and  most  obvious  of  these  principles  is,  “Know  what
you are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:
Do  not  try  to  make  “business  profits”  out  of  securities—that  is,
returns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless
you  know  as  much  about  security  values  as  you  would  need  to
know about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-
facture or deal in.

A second  business  principle:  “Do  not  let  anyone  else  run  your
business,  unless  (1)  you  can  supervise  his  performance  with  ade-
quate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-
sons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For
the investor this rule should determine the conditions under which
he will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.
A third  business  principle:  “Do  not  enter  upon  an  operation—
that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-
culation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.
In particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to
gain  and  much  to  lose.”  For  the  enterprising  investor  this  means
that his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but
on arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits his
return  to  a  small  figure—as  formerly,  at  least,  in  a  conventional
bond  or  preferred  stock—he  must  demand  convincing  evidence
that he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.

The Intelligent Investor

A fourth  business  rule  is  more  positive:  “Have  the  courage  of
your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion
from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—
even though others may hesitate or differ.” (You are neither right
nor  wrong  because  the  crowd  disagrees  with  you.  You  are  right
because your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the world
of  securities,  courage  becomes  the  supreme  virtue  after adequate
knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.

Fortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary
for  his  success  that  he  bring  these  qualities  to  bear  upon  his  pro-
gram—provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines
his activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defen-
sive investment. To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier
than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it
looks.

COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 20

If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected

What is risk?

You’ll  get  different  answers  depending  on  whom,  and  when,  you
ask.  In  1999,  risk  didn’t  mean  losing  money;  it  meant  making  less
money  than  someone  else.  What  many  people  feared  was  bumping
into  somebody  at  a  barbecue  who  was  getting  even  richer  even
quicker  by  day  trading  dot-com  stocks  than  they  were.  Then,  quite
suddenly, by 2003 risk had come to mean that the stock market might
keep dropping until it wiped out whatever traces of wealth you still had
left.

While its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the
financial markets themselves, risk has some profound and permanent
attributes.  The  people  who  take  the  biggest  gambles  and  make  the
biggest gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt
the  worst  in  the  bear  market  that  inevitably  follows.  (Being  “right”
makes speculators even more eager to take extra risk, as their confi-
dence catches fire.) And once you lose big money, you then have to
gamble even harder just to get back to where you were, like a race-
track or casino gambler who desperately doubles up after every bad
bet.  Unless  you  are  phenomenally  lucky,  that’s  a  recipe  for  disaster.
No wonder, when he was asked to sum up everything he had learned
in his long career about how to get rich, the legendary financier J. K.

5% return every year

50% loss in year one, 10% gain every year thereafter

Imagine that you find a stock that you think can grow at 10% a year even if
the market only grows 5% annually. Unfortunately, you are so enthusiastic
that you pay too high a price, and the stock loses 50% of its value the first
year.  Even  if  the  stock  then  generates  double  the  market’s  return,  it  will
take you more than 16 years to overtake the market—simply because you
paid too much, and lost too much, at the outset.

Losing some money is an inevitable part of investing, and there’s noth-
ing you can do to prevent it. But, to be an intelligent investor, you must
take responsibility for ensuring that you never lose most  or  all of your
money. The Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is often portrayed stand-
ing on tiptoe, ready to dart away in the blink of an eye. To keep her sym-

bolically in place, some of Lakshmi’s devotees will lash her statue down
with strips of fabric or nail its feet to the floor. For the intelligent investor,
Graham’s “margin of safety” performs the same function: By refusing to
pay  too  much  for  an  investment,  you  minimize  the  chances  that  your
wealth will ever disappear or suddenly be destroyed.

Consider  this:  Over  the  four  quarters  ending  in  December  1999,
JDS Uniphase Corp., the fiber-optics company, generated $673 mil-
lion  in  net  sales,  on  which  it  lost  $313  million.  Its  tangible  assets
totaled $1.5 billion. Yet, on March 7, 2000, JDS Uniphase’s stock hit
$153  a  share,  giving  the  company  a  total  market  value  of  roughly
$143 billion.2 And then, like most “New Era” stocks, it crashed. Any-
one  who  bought  it  that  day  and  still  clung  to  it  at  the  end  of  2002
faced these prospects:

Risk  exists  in  another  dimension:  inside  you.  If  you  overestimate 
how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability
to  ride  out  a  temporary  plunge  in  prices,  it  doesn’t  matter  what  you
own  or  how  the  market  does.  Ultimately,  financial  risk  resides  not  in
what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you
are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroom
and  step  up  to  the  mirror.  That’s risk,  gazing  back  at  you  from  the
glass.

As  you  look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror,  what  should  you  watch  for?
The Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains two
factors that characterize good decisions:

•

•

“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as
well as I think I do?)
“correctly-anticipated  regret” (how  will  I  react  if  my  analysis
turns out to be wrong?).

To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror  and  ask  yourself:  “What  is  the  likelihood  that  my  analysis  is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:

•

How  much  experience  do  I  have?  What  is  my  track  record  with
similar decisions in the past?

• What  is  the  typical  track  record  of  other  people  who  have  tried

•

•

this in the past?3
If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?
If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?

3 No  one  who  diligently  researched  the  answer  to  this  question,  and  hon-
estly accepted the results, would ever have day traded or bought IPOs.

Commentary on Chapter 20

529

•

Have I calculated how much this investment needs to go up for
me to break even after my taxes and costs of trading?

Next, look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of per-
son who correctly anticipates your regret. Start by asking: “Do I fully
understand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong?”
Answer that question by considering these points:

•

•

If  I’m  right,  I  could  make  a  lot  of  money.  But  what  if  I’m  wrong?
Based on the historical performance of similar investments, how
much could I lose?
Do I have other investments that will tide me over if this decision
turns out to be wrong? Do I already hold stocks, bonds, or funds
with a proven record of going up when the kind of investment I’m
considering goes down? Am I putting too much of my capital at
risk with this new investment?

• When I tell myself, “You have a high tolerance for risk,” how do I
know? Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment? How did
it feel? Did I buy more, or did I bail out?
Am I relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking
at  the  wrong  time?  Or  have  I  controlled  my  own  behavior  in
advance by diversifying, signing an investment contract, and dol-
lar-cost averaging?

•

You should always remember, in the words of the psychologist Paul
Slovic,  that  “risk  is  brewed  from  an  equal  dose  of  two  ingredients—
probabilities and consequences.” 4 Before you invest, you must ensure
that you have realistically assessed your probability of being right and
how you will react to the consequences of being wrong.

P A S C A L ’ S   W A G E R

The investment philosopher Peter Bernstein has another way of sum-
ming  this  up.  He  reaches  back  to  Blaise  Pascal,  the  great  French
mathematician and theologian (1623–1662), who created a thought

4 Paul Slovic, “Informing and Educating the Public about Risk,” Risk Analy-
sis, vol. 6, no. 4 (1986), p. 412.

Commentary on Chapter 20

experiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not God
exists. The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct
in this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in the
afterlife.  In  this  wager,  Pascal  asserts,  “reason  cannot  decide”  the
probability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and
only faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the proba-
bilities  in  Pascal’s  wager  are  a  toss-up,  the  consequences  are  per-
fectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:

Suppose you act as though God is and [ you] lead a life of virtue and
abstinence,  when  in  fact  there  is  no  god.  You  will  have  passed  up
some goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose
you act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and
lust when in fact God is. You may have had fun and thrills during the
relatively brief duration of your lifetime, but when the day of judgment
rolls around you are in big trouble.5

Concludes  Bernstein:  “In  making  decisions  under  conditions  of
uncertainty,  the  consequences  must  dominate  the  probabilities.  We
never  know  the  future.”  Thus,  as  Graham  has  reminded  you  in  every
chapter of this book, the intelligent investor must focus not just on get-
ting the analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analy-
sis turns out to be wrong—as even the best analyses will be at least
some  of  the  time.  The  probability  of  making  at  least  one  mistake  at
some point in your investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds
are entirely out of your control. However, you do have control over the
consequences of being wrong. Many “investors” put essentially all of
their money into dot-com stocks in 1999; an online survey of 1,338
Americans by Money Magazine in 1999 found that nearly one-tenth of
them had at least 85% of their money in Internet stocks. By ignoring
Graham’s call for a margin of safety, these people took the wrong side
of  Pascal’s  wager.  Certain  that  they  knew  the  probabilities  of  being

right,  they  did  nothing  to  protect  themselves  against  the  conse-
quences of being wrong.

Simply by keeping your holdings permanently diversified, and refus-
ing  to  fling  money  at  Mr.  Market’s  latest,  craziest  fashions,  you  can
ensure  that  the  consequences  of  your  mistakes  will  never  be  cata-
strophic. No matter what Mr. Market throws at you, you will always be
able to say, with a quiet confidence, “This, too, shall pass away.”

Postscript

We know very well two partners who spent a good part of their
lives handling their own and other people’s funds on Wall Street.
Some hard experience taught them it was better to be safe and care-
ful  rather  than  to  try  to  make  all  the  money  in  the  world.  They
established a rather unique approach to security operations, which
combined  good  profit  possibilities  with  sound  values.  They
avoided  anything  that  appeared  overpriced  and  were  rather  too
quick to dispose of issues that had advanced to levels they deemed
no  longer  attractive.  Their  portfolio  was  always  well  diversified,
with more than a hundred different issues represented. In this way
they did quite well through many years of ups and downs in the
general  market;  they  averaged  about  20%  per  annum  on  the  sev-
eral  millions  of  capital  they  had  accepted  for  management,  and
their clients were well pleased with the results.*

In  the  year  in  which  the  first  edition  of  this  book  appeared  an
opportunity was offered to the partners’ fund to purchase a half-
interest in a growing enterprise. For some reason the industry did
not have Wall Street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned
down by quite a few important houses. But the pair was impressed
by the company’s possibilities; what was decisive for them was that
the  price  was  moderate  in  relation  to  current  earnings  and  asset
value. The partners went ahead with the acquisition, amounting in
dollars to about one-fifth of their fund. They became closely identi-
fied with the new business interest, which prospered.†

* The  two  partners  Graham  coyly  refers  to  are  Jerome  Newman  and  Ben-
jamin Graham himself.
† Graham  is  describing  the  Government  Employees  Insurance  Co.,  or
GEICO, in which he and Newman purchased a 50% interest in 1948, right

In fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two
hundred  times  or  more  the  price  paid  for  the  half-interest.  The
advance  far  outstripped  the  actual  growth  in  profits,  and  almost
from  the  start  the  quotation  appeared  much  too  high  in  terms  of
the  partners’  own  investment  standards.  But  since  they  regarded
the  company  as  a  sort  of  “family  business,”  they  continued  to
maintain a substantial ownership of the shares despite the spectac-
ular price rise. A large number of participants in their funds did the
same,  and  they  became  millionaires  through  their  holding  in  this
one enterprise, plus later-organized affiliates.*

Ironically  enough,  the  aggregate  of  profits  accruing  from  this
single  investment  decision  far  exceeded  the  sum  of  all  the  others
realized through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the part-
ners’ specialized fields, involving much investigation, endless pon-
dering, and countless individual decisions.

Are there morals to this story of value to the intelligent investor?
An  obvious  one  is  that  there  are  several  different  ways  to  make 
and  keep  money  in  Wall  Street.  Another,  not  so  obvious,  is  that 
one  lucky  break,  or  one  supremely  shrewd  decision—can  we  tell
them  apart?—may  count  for  more  than  a  lifetime  of  journeyman
efforts.1 But  behind  the  luck,  or  the  crucial  decision,  there  must
usually exist a background of preparation and disciplined capacity.
One  needs  to  be  sufficiently  established  and  recognized  so  that
these  opportunities  will  knock  at  his  particular  door.  One  must

around the time he finished writing The Intelligent Investor. The $712,500
that Graham and Newman put into GEICO was roughly 25% of their fund’s
assets at the time. Graham was a member of GEICO’s board of directors
for many years. In a nice twist of fate, Graham’s greatest student, Warren
Buffett, made an immense bet of his own on GEICO in 1976, by which time
the big insurer had slid to the brink of bankruptcy. It turned out to be one of
Buffett’s best investments as well.
* Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed by the
U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission to “spin off,” or distribute, Graham-
Newman Corp.’s GEICO stake to the fund’s shareholders. An investor who
owned  100  shares  of  Graham-Newman  at  the  beginning  of  1948  (worth
$11,413) and who then held on to the GEICO distribution would have had
$1.66  million  by  1972.  GEICO’s  “later-organized  affiliates”  included  Gov-
ernment Employees Financial Corp. and Criterion Insurance Co.

have the means, the judgment, and the courage to take advantage
of them.

Of course, we cannot promise a like spectacular experience to all
intelligent  investors  who  remain  both  prudent  and  alert  through
the years. We are not going to end with J. J. Raskob’s slogan that we
made fun of at the beginning: “Everybody can be rich.” But inter-
esting  possibilities  abound  on  the  financial  scene,  and  the  intelli-
gent  and  enterprising  investor  should  be  able  to  find  both
enjoyment and profit in this three-ring circus. Excitement is guar-
anteed.

COMMENTARY ON POSTSCRIPT

Successful  investing  is  about  managing  risk,  not  avoiding  it.  At  first

glance, when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a sin-
gle stock, you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors’
money.  But  then,  when  you  discover  that  Graham  had  painstakingly
established that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paid
for it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.
But  he  needed  enormous  courage  to  take  the  psychological  risk  of
such a big bet on so unknown a stock.1

And today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:
the death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corpo-
rate  fraud,  the  specters  of  terrorism  and  war.  “Investors  don’t  like
uncertainty,” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV or
in today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and
yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing
world. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart, “uncertainty”
and “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one has ever been
given the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buy
stocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at
all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.

The most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,
told through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late in
his life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses
describes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters
beyond the gates of Hercules:

1 Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who are
not as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against the risk of
putting  too  much  money  into  a  single  investment.  When  Graham  himself
admits that GEICO was a “lucky break,” that’s a signal that most of us can-
not count on being able to find such a great opportunity. To keep investing
from decaying into gambling, you must diversify.

Commentary on Postscript

“O brothers,” I said, “who after a hundred thousand
perils have reached the west,
in this little waking vigil
that still remains to our senses,
let us not choose to avoid the experience
of the unpeopled world that lies behind the sun.
Consider the seeds from which you sprang:
You were made not to live like beasts,
but to seek virtue and understanding.”
With this little oration I made my shipmates
so eager for the voyage
that it would have hurt to hold them back.
And we swung our stern toward the morning
and turned our oars into wings for the wild flight.2

Investing,  too,  is  an  adventure;  the  financial  future  is  always  an
uncharted world. With Graham as your guide, your lifelong investing
voyage should be as safe and confident as it is adventurous.

1. The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville

by Warren E. Buffett

EDITOR’S NOTE: This  article  is  an  edited  transcript  of  a  talk  given  at
Columbia University in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of
Security Analysis,  written  by  Benjamin  Graham  and  David  L.  Dodd.
This  specialized  volume  first  introduced  the  ideas  later  popularized  in
The Intelligent Investor. Buffett’s essay offers a fascinating study of how
Graham’s disciples have used Graham’s value investing approach to real-
ize phenomenal success in the stock market.

Is  the  Graham  and  Dodd  “look  for  values  with  a  significant
margin  of  safety  relative  to  prices”  approach  to  security  analysis
out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say
yes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock
prices  reflect  everything  that  is  known  about  a  company’s
prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no under-
valued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart secu-
rity  analysts  who  utilize  all  available  information  to  ensure
unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the mar-
ket  year  after  year  are  just  lucky.  “If  prices  fully  reflect  available
information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes
one of today’s textbook authors.

Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors
who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500
stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at

537

538

Appendixes

least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that
these  winners  were  all  well  known  to  me  and  pre-identified  as
superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fif-
teen years ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recently
searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you
this  morning—I  would  advise  you  to  stop  reading  right  here.  I
should add that all these records have been audited. And I should
further add that I have known many of those who have invested
with these managers, and the checks received by those participants
over the years have matched the stated records.

Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a
national  coin-flipping  contest.  Let’s  assume  we  get  225  million
Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a
dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the
flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who
called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent
day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.
After  ten  flips  on  ten  mornings,  there  will  be  approximately
220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten
flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

Now  this  group  will  probably  start  getting  a  little  puffed  up
about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-
est, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive
members  of  the  opposite  sex  what  their  technique  is,  and  what
marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards
from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who
have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,
by  this  exercise,  each  have  turned  one  dollar  into  a  little  over 
$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would
have been won.

By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-
bly  write  books  on  “How  I  Turned  a  Dollar  into  a  Million  in
Twenty  Days  Working  Thirty  Seconds  a  Morning.”  Worse  yet,
they’ll  probably  start  jetting  around  the  country  attending  semi-
nars  on  efficient  coin-flipping  and  tackling  skeptical  professors
with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”

But  then  some  business  school  professor  will  probably  be 
rude  enough  to  bring  up  the  fact  that  if  225  million  orangutans 

Appendixes

539

had  engaged  in  a  similar  exercise,  the  results  would  be  much 
the  same—215  egotistical  orangutans  with  20  straight  winning
flips.

I  would  argue,  however,  that  there  are some  important  differ-
ences  in  the  examples  I  am  going  to  present.  For  one  thing,  if  (a)
you  had  taken  225  million  orangutans  distributed  roughly  as  the
U.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if
(c)  you  found  that  40  came  from  a  particular  zoo  in  Omaha,  you
would  be  pretty  sure  you  were  on  to  something.  So  you  would
probably  go  out  and  ask  the  zookeeper  about  what  he’s  feeding
them,  whether  they  had  special  exercises,  what  books  they  read,
and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-
dinary  concentrations  of  success,  you  might  want  to  see  if  you
could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might
be causal factors.

Scientific  inquiry  naturally  follows  such  a  pattern.  If  you  were
trying  to  analyze  possible  causes  of  a  rare  type  of  cancer—with,
say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400
of  them  occurred  in  some  little  mining  town  in  Montana,  you
would get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of
those  afflicted,  or  other  variables. You  know  that  it’s  not  random
chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily
know the causal factors, but you would know where to search.

I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other
than  geography.  In  addition  to  geographical  origins,  there  can  be
what I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a dispro-
portionate  number  of  successful  coin-flippers  in  the  investment
world  came  from  a  very  small  intellectual  village  that  could  be
called  Graham-and-Doddsville.  A concentration  of  winners  that
simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-
lar intellectual village.

Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration
unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-
flipping  call  of  some  terribly  persuasive  personality.  When  he
called heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same
way. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that
100  came  from  the  same  intellectual  origin  would  mean  nothing.
You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Sim-
ilarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society

540

Appendixes

and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten
members.  Further  assume  that  the  patriarchal  culture  was  so
strong  that,  when  the  225  million  people  went  out  the  first  day,
every member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now,
at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and
you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive
types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor
as  an  explanation  of  successful  coin-flipping.  But,  of  course,  it
would  have  no  significance  at  all  because  it  would  simply  mean
that  you  didn’t  have  215  individual  winners,  but  rather  21.5  ran-
domly distributed families who were winners.

In  this  group  of  successful  investors  that  I  want  to  consider,
there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But
the  children  who  left  the  house  of  this  intellectual  patriarch  have
called their “flips” in very different ways. They have gone to differ-
ent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet
they have had a combined record that simply can’t be explained by
random  chance.  It  certainly  cannot  be  explained  by  the  fact  that
they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the
calls  to  make.  The  patriarch  has  merely  set  forth  the  intellectual
theory  for  making  coin-calling  decisions,  but  each  student  has
decided on his own manner of applying the theory.

The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-
and-Doddsville  is  this:  they  search  for  discrepancies  between  the
value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in
the  market.  Essentially,  they  exploit  those  discrepancies  without
the efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are
bought  on  Monday  or  Thursday,  or  whether  it  is  January  or  July,
etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just
what  our  Graham  &  Dodd  investors  are  doing  through  the
medium  of  marketable  stocks—I  doubt  that  many  are  cranking
into  their  purchase  decision  the  day  of  the  week  or  the  month  in
which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any dif-
ference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a
Friday,  I  am  baffled  why  academicians  invest  extensive  time  and
effort  to  see  whether  it  makes  a  difference  when  buying  small
pieces  of  those  same  businesses.  Our  Graham  &  Dodd  investors,
needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model,
or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of

Appendixes

541

any  interest  to  them.  In  fact,  most  of  them  would  have  difficulty
defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables:
price and value.

I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of
price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine
buying an entire business simply because the price of the business
had been marked up substantially last week and the week before?
Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and
volume  variables  is  that  now,  in  the  age  of  computers,  there  are
almost  endless  data  available  about  them.  It  isn’t  necessarily
because such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are
there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati-
cal  skills  needed  to  manipulate  them.  Once  these  skills  are
acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no
utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

I think the group that we have identified by a common intellec-
tual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic
studies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, season-
ality,  capitalization  size,  etc.,  upon  stock  performance,  no  interest
has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con-
centration of value-oriented winners.

I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of
us  who  worked  at  Graham-Newman  Corporation  from  1954
through  1956.  There  were  only  four—I  have  not  selected  these
names from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-
Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned
me  down  as  overvalued.  He  took  this  value  stuff  very  seriously!
After  much  pestering  he  finally  hired  me.  There  were  three  part-
ners  and  four  of  us  at  the  “peasant”  level.  All  four  left  between
1955  and  1957  when  the  firm  was  wound  up,  and  it’s  possible  to
trace the record of three.

The first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter
Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben
Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left
Graham-Newman  in  1955  and  achieved  the  record  shown  here
over 28 years.

Here  is  what  “Adam  Smith”—after  I  told  him  about  Walter—

wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):

542

Appendixes

He has no connections or access to useful information. Practi-
cally no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas.
He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual
reports, and that’s about it.

In  introducing  me  to  [Schloss]  Warren  had  also,  to  my  mind,
described  himself.  “He  never  forgets  that  he  is  handling  other
people’s money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to
loss.”  He  has  total  integrity  and  a  realistic  picture  of  himself.
Money is real to him and stocks are real—and from this flows an
attraction to the “margin of safety” principle.

Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks
currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at consider-
ably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does.
He  doesn’t  worry  about  whether  it’s  January,  he  doesn’t  worry
about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an
election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I
can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he
does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks
than I do—and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the
business:  I  don’t  seem  to  have  very  much  influence  on  Walter.
That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.

The  second  case  is  Tom  Knapp,  who  also  worked  at  Graham-
Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before
the  war;  when  he  came  back  from  the  war,  he  was  a  beach  bum.
And  then  one  day  he  read  that  Dave  Dodd  was  giving  a  night
course  in  investments  at  Columbia.  Tom  took  it  on  a  noncredit
basis,  and  he  got  so  interested  in  the  subject  from  taking  that
course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School,
where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and
took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom
to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the
beach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!

In 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple,
along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed
Tweedy,  Browne  Partners,  and  their  investment  results  appear  in
Table 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversifi-
cation.  They  occasionally  bought  control  of  businesses,  but  the
record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the con-
trol investments.

Table  3  describes  the  third  member  of  the  group  who  formed
Buffett  Partnership  in  1957.  The  best  thing  he  did  was  to  quit  in
1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a contin-
uation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index
I can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment
management at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it
has been satisfactory.

Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed
by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane.
After  getting  out  of  Harvard  Business  School,  he  went  to  Wall
Street. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa-
tion so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met
in  early  1951.  Bill’s  record  from  1951  to  1970,  working  with  rela-
tively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up
Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle
all our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a ter-
rible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier
market  and  all  the  difficulties  that  made  for  comparative  perfor-
mance  for  value-oriented  investors.  I  am  happy  to  say  that  my
partners,  to  an  amazing  degree,  not  only  stayed  with  him  but
added money, with the happy result shown.

There’s  no  hindsight  involved  here.  Bill  was  the  only  person  I
recommended  to  my  partners,  and  I  said  at  the  time  that  if  he
achieved  a  four-point-per-annum  advantage  over  the  Standard  &
Poor’s,  that  would  be  solid  performance.  Bill  has  achieved  well
over that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That
makes  things  much  more  difficult.  Size  is  the  anchor  of  perfor-
mance. There is no question about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do
better  than  average  when  you  get  larger,  but  the  margin  shrinks.
And  if  you  ever  get  so  you’re  managing  two  trillion  dollars,  and
that happens to be the amount of the total equity evaluation in the
economy, don’t think that you’ll do better than average!

I should add that in the records we’ve looked at so far, through-
out this whole period there was practically no duplication in these
portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepan-
cies between price and value, but they make their selections very
differently.  Walter’s  largest  holdings  have  been  such  stalwarts  as
Hudson  Pulp  &  Paper  and  Jeddo  Highland  Coal  and  New  York
Trap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly
to  mind  to  even  a  casual  reader  of  the  business  pages.  Tweedy

544

Appendixes

Browne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms
of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big
companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very
low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty
people yelling out the same thing after him.

Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law
graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960
and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better.
He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfo-
lio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record
was  much  more  volatile  but  it  was  based  on  the  same  discount-
from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and
valleys  of  performance,  and  he  happens  to  be  a  fellow  whose
whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown.
Incidentally,  this  record  belongs  to  Charlie  Munger,  my  partner 
for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he 
ran  his  partnership,  however,  his  portfolio  holdings  were  almost
completely  different  from  mine  and  the  other  fellows  mentioned
earlier.

Table  6  is  the  record  of  a  fellow  who  was  a  pal  of  Charlie
Munger’s—another  non–business  school  type—who  was  a  math
major at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was
an IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to
him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965
to  1983,  against  a  compounded  gain  of  316  percent  for  the  S&P,
came  off  with  22,200  percent,  which,  probably  because  he  lacks  a
business school education, he regards as statistically significant.

One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buy-
ing  dollar  bills  for  40  cents  takes  immediately  with  people  or  it
doesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a per-
son right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show
him  records,  and  it  doesn’t  make  any  difference.  They  just  don’t
seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick
Guerin,  who  had  no  formal  education  in  business,  understands
immediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying it
five minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradual
convert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem to
be a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or it
is nothing.

Table  7  is  the  record  of  Stan  Perlmeter.  Stan  was  a  liberal  arts
major  at  the  University  of  Michigan  who  was  a  partner  in  the
advertising  agency  of  Bozell  &  Jacobs.  We  happened  to  be  in  the
same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better busi-
ness than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes
for Stan to embrace the value approach.

Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not
own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently.
But  every  time  Perlmeter  buys  a  stock  it’s  because  he’s  getting
more  for  his  money  than  he’s  paying.  That’s  the  only  thing  he’s
thinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections,
he’s  not  looking  at  next  year’s  earnings,  he’s  not  thinking  about
what  day  of  the  week  it  is,  he  doesn’t  care  what  investment
research from any place says, he’s not interested in price momen-
tum,  volume,  or  anything.  He’s  simply  asking:  What  is  the  busi-
ness worth?

Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been
involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with
which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influ-
enced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented man-
agers.  Very,  very  few  pension  funds  are  managed  from  a  value
standpoint.  Table  8  is  the  Washington  Post  Company’s  Pension
Fund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that
they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.
As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever
since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at
least  25  percent  of  these  funds  in  bonds,  which  would  not  have
been necessarily the choice of these managers. So I’ve included the
bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no par-
ticular  expertise  about  bonds.  They  wouldn’t  have  said  they  did.
Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was
not  their  game,  they  were  in  the  top  percentile  of  fund  manage-
ment.  The  Washington  Post  experience  does  not  cover  a  terribly
long  period  but  it  does  represent  many  investment  decisions  by
three managers who were not identified retroactively.

Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t man-
age a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to
select value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected
managers much the same way as most larger companies. They now

546

Appendixes

rank  number  one  in  the  Becker  survey  of  pension  funds  for  their
size over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the
value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any
duration  beyond  a  year.  Seven  of  them  had  a  cumulative  record
better than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the
S&P.  The  net  difference  now  between  a  median  performance  and
the  actual  performance  of  the  FMC  fund  over  this  period  is  $243
million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the
selection  of  managers.  Those  managers  are  not  the  managers  I
would necessarily select but they have the common denominator
of selecting securities based on value.

So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-
Doddsville.  I  haven’t  selected  them  with  hindsight  from  among
thousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of
lottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won the
lottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework
for investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught
and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect,
character, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that
this group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record
in  years  when  the  general  market  was  weak.  While  they  differ
greatly  in  style,  these  investors  are,  mentally,  always  buying  the
business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole
businesses.  Far  more  often  they  simply  buy  small  pieces  of  busi-
nesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-
ness,  is  the  same.  Some  of  them  hold  portfolios  with  dozens  of
stocks;  others  concentrate  on  a  handful.  But  all  exploit  the  differ-
ence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.
I’m  convinced  that  there  is  much  inefficiency  in  the  market.
These  Graham-and-Doddsville  investors  have  successfully  ex-
ploited  gaps  between  price  and  value.  When  the  price  of  a  stock
can be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the
margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or
the  most  depressed  person,  it  is  hard  to  argue  that  the  market
always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently non-
sensical.

I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward.
Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If
someone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have

Appendixes

547

slipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it
once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline—
perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer
me $5 million to pull the trigger twice—now that would be a posi-
tive correlation between risk and reward!

The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dol-
lar  bill  for  60  cents,  it’s  riskier  than  if  you  buy  a  dollar  bill  for 
40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case.
The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less
risk there is.

One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was
selling  for  $80  million  in  the  market.  At  the  time,  that  day,  you
could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than
$400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the
Post,  Newsweek, plus  several  television  stations  in  major  markets.
Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who
would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.

Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made
the  valuation  $40  million  instead  of  $80  million,  its  beta  would
have been greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the
cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in
Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to
buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 mil-
lion. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities
and  you  know  anything  at  all  about  business  valuation,  there  is
essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particu-
larly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles for $8 million each.
Since you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to
be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people,
but that’s not a difficult job.

You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a
very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.
But  you  do  not  cut  it  close.  That  is  what  Ben  Graham  meant  by
having a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth
$83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-
gin.  When  you  build  a  bridge,  you  insist  it  can  carry  30,000
pounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it. And that
same principle works in investing.

In  conclusion,  some  of  the  more  commercially  minded  among

548

Appendixes

you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many con-
verts  to  the  value  approach  will  perforce  narrow  the  spreads
between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been
out  for  50  years,  ever  since  Ben  Graham  and  Dave  Dodd  wrote
Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing
in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some per-
verse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.
The  academic  world,  if  anything,  has  actually  backed  away  from
the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to
continue  that  way.  Ships  will  sail  around  the  world  but  the  Flat
Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrep-
ancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who
read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.

2. Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment
Income and Security Transactions (in 1972)

Editor’s  note:  Due  to  extensive  changes  in  the  rules  governing  such
transactions,  the  following  document  is  presented  here  for  historical
purposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the
information  therein  was  correct.  However,  intervening  developments
have rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-
ing Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of
“The  Basics  of  Investment  Taxation,”  which  brings  the  reader  up-to-
date on the relevant rules.

Rule 1—Interest and Dividends

Interest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)
income  received  from  state,  municipal,  and  similar  obligations,
which are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)
dividends  representing  a  return  of  capital,  (c)  certain  dividends
paid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of
ordinary domestic-corporation dividends.

Rule 2—Capital Gains and Losses

Short-term  capital  gains  and  losses  are  merged  to  obtain  net
short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses
are merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the
net short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,
100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-
mum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on the
balance.

A net  capital  loss  (the  amount  exceeding  capital  gains)  is
deductible  from  ordinary  income  to  a  maximum  of  $1,000  in  the
current  year  and  in  each  of  the  next  five  years.  Alternatively,
unused  losses  may  be  applied  at  any  time  to  offset  capital  gains.
(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally
than later losses.)

Note Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”

Most  investment  funds  (“investment  companies”)  take  advan-
tage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be

562

Appendixes

taxed  substantially  as  partnerships.  Thus  if  they  make  long-term
security  profits  they  can  distribute  these  as  “capital-gain  divi-
dends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way
as long-term gains. These carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi-
dends. Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% tax
for  the  account  of  its  shareholders  and  then  retain  the  balance  of
the  capital  gains  without  distributing  them  as  capital-gain  divi-
dends.

3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)

Interest and Dividends

Interest  and  dividends  are  taxed  at  your  ordinary-income  tax  rate
except (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from
Federal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-
resenting  a  return  of  capital,  and  (c)  long-term  capital-gain  distribu-
tions  paid  by  mutual  funds  (see  below).  Private-activity  municipal
bonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-
native minimum tax.

Capital Gains and Losses

Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-
term  capital  gain  or  loss.  Long-term  capital  gains  and  losses  are
merged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net
short-term  capital  gain  exceeds  the  net  long-term  capital  loss,  that
excess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-
tal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—
which will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,
2000, and held for more than five years.

A net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-
um  of  $3,000  in  the  current  year.  Any  capital  losses  in  excess  of
$3,000  may  be  applied  in  later  tax  years  to  offset  future  capital 
gains.

Mutual Funds

As “regulated investment companies,” nearly all mutual funds take
advantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from

Appendixes

563

corporate  income  tax.  After  selling  long-term  holdings,  mutual  funds
can distribute the profits as “capital-gain dividends,” which their share-
holders treat as long-term gains. These are taxed at a lower rate (gen-
erally 20%) than ordinary dividends (up to 39%). You should generally
avoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter of each
year, when these capital-gain distributions are usually distributed; oth-
erwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund before you even
owned it.

4. The New Speculation in Common Stocks1

What I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years
in Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has
included  the  recurrent  advent  of  new  conditions,  or  a  new  atmo-
sphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that
one of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-
rity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-
ity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we
have no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least
studied  and  understood  them.  My  address  today  is  an  effort
toward  such  understanding  in  a  limited  field—in  particular,  an
endeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the
present  and  the  past  in  our  underlying  attitudes  toward  invest-
ment and speculation in common stocks.

Let me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-
lative  elements  of  a  common  stock  resided  almost  exclusively  in
the  company  itself;  they  were  due  to  uncertainties,  or  fluctuating
elements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-
tion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of
course; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished
by a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But
in revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-
duced into the common-stock arena from outside the companies. It
comes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying public
and their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude may
be described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-
tions.

Nothing  will  appear  more  logical  and  natural  to  this  audience
than  the  idea  that  a  common  stock  should  be  valued  and  priced

564

Appendixes

primarily  on  the  basis  of  the  company’s  expected  future  perfor-
mance. Yet this simple-appearing concept carries with it a number
of paradoxes and pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of
the  older,  well-established  distinctions  between  investment  and
speculation.  The  dictionary  says  that  “speculate”  comes  from  the
Latin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked
out and saw future developments coming before other people did.
But  today,  if  the  investor  is  shrewd  or  well  advised,  he  too  must
have his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common
lookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.

Secondly,  we  find  that,  for  the  most  part,  companies  with  the
best investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the
ones  which  are  likely  to  attract  the  largest  speculative  interest  in
their common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed
a brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-
ticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the application
of  formulas  out  of  higher  mathematics  to  establish  the  present
value of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-
las with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, or
rather  to  justify,  practically  any  value  one  wishes,  however  high,
for a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on
close examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-
sonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and
maintain  itself  for  a  given  growth  company;  hence  at  times  the
market  may  conceivably  value  the  growth  component  at  a  strik-
ingly low figure.

Returning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-
ulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them by
two outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-
nous.  Let  me  illustrate  briefly  the  old-time  speculative  common
stock,  as  distinguished  from  an  investment  stock,  by  some  data
relating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.
(These  appear  in  Benjamin  Graham  and  David  L.  Dodd,  Security
Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)

In  those  three  years  the  price  range  of  “Pennsy”  moved  only
between 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-
ings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable
$3  dividend,  and  investors  were  sure  that  it  was  backed  by  well
over its par of $50 in tangible assets. By contrast, the price of Amer-

Appendixes

565

ican  Can  ranged  between  9  and  47;  its  earnings  between  7  cents
and  $8.86;  the  ratio  of  price  to  the  three-year  average  earnings
moved between 1.9 times and 10 times; it paid no dividend at all;
and  sophisticated  investors  were  well  aware  that  the  $100  par
value  of  the  common  represented  nothing  but  undisclosed
“water,”  since  the  preferred  issue  exceeded  the  tangible  assets
available for it. Thus American Can common was a representative
speculative  issue,  because  American  Can  Company  was  then  a
speculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain
industry.  Actually,  American  Can  had  a  far  more  brilliant  long-
term future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact
not suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if
it had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors
as basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the
years 1911–1913.

Now,  to  expose  you  to  the  development  through  time  of  the
importance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to
use  as  my  example  our  most  spectacular  giant  industrial  enter-
prise—none  other  than  International  Business  Machines,  which
last  year  entered  the  small  group  of  companies  with  $1  billion  of
sales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in
order  to  inject  a  little  of  the  personal  touch  into  what  otherwise
would be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college
for a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-
pany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-
lutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose
we  used  the  so-called  Hollerith  machines,  leased  out  by  the  then
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card
punches,  card  sorters,  and  tabulators—tools  almost  unknown  to
businessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-
sus  Bureau.  I  entered  Wall  Street  in  1914,  and  the  next  year  the
bonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the
New York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-
est  in  that  enterprise,  and  besides  I  considered  myself  a  sort  of
technological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-
cial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went to
the head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him
that  C.-T.-R.  stock  was  selling  in  the  middle  40s  (for  105,000
shares);  that  it  had  earned  $6.50  in  1915;  that  its  book  value—

566

Appendixes

including, to be sure, some nonsegregated intangibles—was $130;
that it had started a $3 dividend; and that I thought rather highly of
the  company’s  products  and  prospects.  Mr.  A.  N.  looked  at  me
pityingly.  “Ben,”  said  he,  “do  not  mention  that  company  to  me
again.  I  would  not  touch  it  with  a  ten-foot  pole.  [His  favorite
expression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they
are no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knows
there is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that
was the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account
of  the  balance  sheet  was  fictitious.  Many  industrial  companies—
notably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but
water,  concealed  in  a  written-up  plant  account.  Since  they  had
“nothing”  to  back  them  but  earning  power  and  future  prospects,
no self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)

I  returned  to  my  statistician’s  cubbyhole,  a  chastened  young
man.  Mr.  A.  N.  was  not  only  experienced  and  successful,  but
extremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-
ing  condemnation  of  Computing-Tabulating-Recording  that  I
never bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name was
changed to International Business Machines in 1926.

Now let us take a look at the same company with its new name
in  1926,  a  year  of  pretty  high  stock  markets.  At  that  time  it  first
revealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large
sum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar
of the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-
ing but water. However, since that time the company had made an
impressive  record  under  the  direction  of  T.  L.  Watson,  Sr.  Its  net
had  risen  from  $691,000  to  $3.7  million—over  fivefold—a  greater
percentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year
period. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and
had split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for the
new  stock,  while  earnings  were  $6.39  thereon.  You  might  have
expected  the  1926  stock  market  to  have  been  pretty  enthusiastic
about a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade
position.  Let  us  see.  The  price  range  for  that  year  was  31  low,  59
high. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-
plier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had
done in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible
book value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced
than eleven years earlier.

Appendixes

567

These  data  illustrate,  as  well  as  any  can,  the  persistence  of  the
old-time  investment  viewpoint  until  the  culminating  years  of  the
bull  market  of  the  1920s.  What  has  happened  since  then  can  be
summarized  by  using  ten-year  intervals  in  the  history  of  IBM.  In
1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-
plier rose from 7 to 171⁄2. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 21⁄2 times,
but the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 171⁄2. Then the pace
accelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and the
average multiplier rose to 321⁄2. Last year, with a further gain in net,
the multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the
unconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.

When  we  examine  these  recent  price  figures  with  care  we  see
some interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years
earlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance
sheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by
disclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has
been put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investors
and  speculators  themselves.  When  IBM  now  sells  at  7  times  its
book value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the
same as if it had no book value at all. Or the small book-value por-
tion  can  be  considered  as  a  sort  of  minor  preferred-stock  compo-
nent  of  the  price,  the  rest  representing  exactly  the  same  sort  of
commitment  as  the  old-time  speculator  made  when  he  bought
Woolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely for their earning power
and future prospects.

It is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which
saw IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earn-
ings enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous specu-
lative  aspects  of  our  large  industrial  companies  have  tended  to
disappear, or at least to diminish greatly. Their financial positions
are firm, their capital structures conservative: they are managed far
more expertly, and even more honestly, than before. Furthermore,
the requirements of complete disclosure have removed one of the
important  speculative  elements  of  years  ago—that  derived  from
ignorance and mystery.

Another personal digression here. In my early years in the Street
one  of  the  favorite  mystery  stocks  was  Consolidated  Gas  of  New
York, now Consolidated Edison. It owned as a subsidiary the prof-
itable New York Edison Company, but it reported only dividends
received from this source, not its full earnings. The unreported Edi-

568

Appendixes

son earnings supplied the mystery and the “hidden value.” To my
surprise I discovered that these hush-hush figures were actually on
file  each  year  with  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  the  state.  It
was a simple matter to consult the records and to present the true
earnings  of  Consolidated  Gas  in  a  magazine  article.  (Incidentally,
the  addition  to  profits  was  not  spectacular.)  One  of  my  older
friends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy to
supply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you
for nothing. Consolidated Gas with the mystery is both more inter-
esting  and  more  valuable  than  ex-mystery.  You  youngsters  who
want  to  stick  your  noses  into  everything  are  going  to  ruin  Wall
Street.”

It is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to
the  speculative  fires  have  now  all  but  disappeared.  These  were
Mystery,  Manipulation,  and  (thin)  Margins.  But  we  security  ana-
lysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are
so  speculative  in  themselves  as  to  pretty  well  take  the  place  of
those  older  speculative  factors.  Do  we  not  have  our  own  “3M’s”
now—none  other  than  Minnesota  Mining  and  Manufacturing
Company—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the
new  speculation  as  contrasted  with  the  old?  Consider  a  few  fig-
ures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the market
was valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show
no increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at
$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and a
cool $11⁄2 billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”
We do not know the process of calculation by which that valuation
of good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later
the market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,
or about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-
rately  the  intangible  component  of  a  splendid  company  such  as
this. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-
tant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-
tain  becomes  the  true  value  of  the  enterprise,  and  therefore  the
more speculative inherently the common stock.

It may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed
in the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-
lier times with today. A generation or more ago it was the standard
rule, recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal

Appendixes

valuations, that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conser-
vative  basis  than  tangibles. A good  industrial  company  might  be
required to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible
assets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its
excess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be
valued  on,  say,  a  15  per  cent  basis.  (You  will  find  approximately
these ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-
mon  stock  in  1911,  and  in  numerous  others.)  But  what  has  hap-
pened  since  the  1920s?  Essentially  the  exact  reverse  of  these
relationships  may  now  be  seen.  A company  must  now  typically
earn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the
average market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10
per cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a higher
multiplier,  than  the  base  earnings  required  to  support  the  book
value  in  the  market.  Thus  a  company  earning  15  per  cent  on  the
equity may well sell at 131⁄2 times earnings, or twice its net assets.
This would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-
ued  at  only  10  times,  but  the  next  5  per  cent—what  used  to  be
called the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.

Now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-
dure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-
tions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given these
liberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,
and the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more
cogently  because  high  earnings  on  capital  generally  go  hand  in
hand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really
paid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not
the good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name
and a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-
tations of increased profits in the future.

This brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of
the  new  attitude  toward  common-stock  valuations,  which  I  shall
touch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests
show, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—
i.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-
metical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase
directly as the square of the earnings, but inversely the book value.
Thus  in  an  important  and  very  real  sense  tangible  assets  have
become  a  drag  on  average  market  value  rather  than  a  source

570

Appendixes

thereof. Take a far from extreme illustration. If Company A earns $4
a  share  on  a  $20  book  value,  and  Company  B  also  $4  a  share  on
$100  book  value,  Company A is  almost  certain  to  sell  at  a  higher
multiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say $60 for
Company A shares and $35 for Company B shares. Thus it would
not be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets for
Company  B  are  responsible  for  the  $25  per  share  lower  market
price, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.

But  more  important  than  the  foregoing  is  the  general  relation-
ship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.
Given the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the
rate  of  earnings  growth,  (b)  a  sufficiently  long  projection  of  this
growth  into  the  future,  and  (c)  the  miraculous  workings  of  com-
pound  interest—lo!  the  security  analyst  is  supplied  with  a  new
kind  of  philosopher’s  stone  which  can  produce  or  justify  any
desired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in a
recent article in the Analysts’ Journal on the vogue of higher mathe-
matics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition of
the  striking  analogy  between  value  calculations  of  growth  stocks
and  the  famous  Petersburg  Paradox,  which  has  challenged  and
confused  mathematicians  for  more  than  two  hundred  years.  The
point I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the
relationship  between  mathematics  and  investment  attitudes  on
common  stocks,  which  is  this:  Mathematics  is  ordinarily  consid-
ered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock
market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more
uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.
In forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never
seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or
related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or
the  most  elementary  algebra.  Whenever  calculus  is  brought  in, 
or  higher  algebra,  you  could  take  it  as  a  warning  signal  that  the
operator  was  trying  to  substitute  theory  for  experience,  and  usu-
ally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.

The  older  ideas  of  common-stock  investment  may  seem  quite
naïve  to  the  sophisticated  security  analyst  of  today.  The  great
emphasis was always on what we now call the defensive aspects of
the  company  or  issue—mainly  the  assurance  that  it  would  con-
tinue  its  dividend  unreduced  in  bad  times.  Thus  the  strong  rail-

Appendixes

571

roads, which constituted the standard investment commons of fifty
years ago, were actually regarded in very much the same way as
the public-utility commons in recent years. If the past record indi-
cated stability, the chief requirement was met; not too much effort
was made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying character
in the future. But, conversely, especially favorable future prospects
were  regarded  by  shrewd  investors  as  something  to  look  for  but
not to pay for.

In  effect  this  meant  that  the  investor  did  not  have  to  pay  any-
thing  substantial  for  superior  long-term  prospects.  He  got  these,
virtually without extra cost, as a reward for his own superior intel-
ligence  and  judgment  in  picking  the  best  rather  than  the  merely
good  companies.  For  common  stocks  with  the  same  financial
strength,  past  earnings  record,  and  dividend  stability  all  sold  at
about the same dividend yield.

This  was  indeed  a  shortsighted  point  of  view,  but  it  had  the
great  advantage  of  making  common-stock  investment  in  the  old
days  not  only  simple  but  also  basically  sound  and  highly  prof-
itable.  Let  me  return  for  the  last  time  to  a  personal  note.  Some-
where around 1920 our firm distributed a series of little pamphlets
entitled Lessons for Investors. Of course it took a brash analyst in his
middle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a
title. But in one of the papers I made the casual statement that “if a
common stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation.”
For, reasoned I, if a common stock was so sound that it carried very
little risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel-
lent  chances  for  future  gains.  Now  this  was  a  perfectly  true  and
even valuable discovery, but it was true only because nobody paid
any attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke up to
the  historical  merits  of  common  stocks  as  long-term  investments,
they  soon  ceased  to  have  any  such  merit,  because  the  public’s
enthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built-
in  margin  of  safety,  and  thus  drove  them  out  of  the  investment
class. Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,
and we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring
(in 1931) that no common stock could ever be an investment.

When  we  view  this  long-range  experience  in  perspective  we
find  another  set  of  paradoxes  in  the  investor’s  changing  attitude
toward capital gains as contrasted with income. It seems a truism

572

Appendixes

to  say  that  the  old-time  common-stock  investor  was  not  much
interested in capital gains. He bought almost entirely for safety and
income, and let the speculator concern himself with price apprecia-
tion.  Today  we  are  likely  to  say  that  the  more  experienced  and
shrewd the investor, the less attention he pays to dividend returns,
and  the  more  heavily  his  interest  centers  on  long-term  apprecia-
tion.  Yet  one  might  argue,  perversely,  that  precisely  because  the
old-time  investor  did  not  concentrate  on  future  capital  apprecia-
tion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it,
at  least  in  the  field  of  industrial  stocks.  And,  conversely,  today’s
investor  is  so  concerned  with  anticipating  the  future  that  he  is
already  paying  handsomely  for  it  in  advance.  Thus  what  he  has
projected with so much study and care may actually happen and
still not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the
degree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary
and perhaps even permanent loss.

What lessons—again using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam-
phlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with
current attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We can
look back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for
the present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and
Heaven  too”  combination.  Shaking  our  heads  sadly  we  mutter,
“Those  days  are  gone  forever.”  Have  not  investors  and  security
analysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects?
By so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves from
that  Eden  where  promising  common  stocks  at  reasonable  prices
could be plucked off the bushes? Are we doomed always to run the
risk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and
prospects,  or  of  getting  poor  quality  and  prospects  when  we  pay
what seems a reasonable price?

It certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that
pessimistic  dilemma.  Recently,  I  did  a  little  research  in  the  long-
term history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimu-
lated  by  the  arresting  chart  of  fifty-nine  years  of  earnings  and
dividends appearing in their recently published 1957 Report. These
figures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana-
lyst. For one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E.
was fairly modest and quite irregular. The 1946 earnings, per share
adjusted, were only 30 per cent higher than in 1902—52 cents ver-

Appendixes

573

sus 40 cents—and in no year of this period were the 1902 earnings
as much as doubled. Yet the price-earnings ratio rose from 9 times
in 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946. One might
say,  of  course,  that  the  1946  multiplier  at  least  showed  the  well-
known  prescience  of  shrewd  investors.  We  analysts  were  able  to
foresee then the really brilliant period of growth that was looming
ahead  in  the  next  decade.  Maybe  so.  But  some  of  you  remember
that the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high
for G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary
fall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1
split) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings
and its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.
Our crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve
months.

This striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts
some little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of
the  popular  belief  among  analysts  that  prominent  and  promising
companies will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that
this is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well
accept  and  like  it.  I  have  no  desire  at  all  to  be  dogmatic  on  this
point. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of
you must seek to settle it for yourself.

But  in  my  concluding  remarks  I  can  say  something  definite
about  the  structure  of  the  market  for  various  types  of  common
stocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.
In  the  old  days  the  investment  character  of  a  common  stock  was
more or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-
prise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating. The lower
the  yield  on  its  bonds  or  preferred,  the  more  likely  was  the  com-
mon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment, and the
smaller  the  element  of  speculation  involved  in  its  purchase.  This
relationship, between the speculative ranking of the common and
the  investment  rating  of  the  company,  could  be  graphically
expressed  pretty  much  as  a  straight  line  descending  from  left  to
right.  But  nowadays  I  would  describe  the  graph  as  U-shaped. At
the left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,
the  common  stock  is  of  course  highly  speculative,  just  as  it  has
always been in the past. At the right extremity, however, where the
company has the highest credit rating because both its past record

574

Appendixes

and  future  prospects  are  most  impressive,  we  find  that  the  stock
market tends more or less continuously to introduce a highly spec-
ulative element into the common shares through the simple means
of a price so high as to carry a fair degree of risk.

At  this  point  I  cannot  forbear  introducing  a  surprisingly  rele-
vant, if quite exaggerated, quotation on the subject which I found
recently in one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. It reads:

Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor
Lose all and more by paying too much rent?

Returning  to  my  imaginary  graph,  it  would  be  the  center  area
where the speculative element in common-stock purchases would
tend to reach its minimum. In this area we could find many well-
established  and  strong  companies,  with  a  record  of  past  growth
corresponding  to  that  of  the  national  economy  and  with  future
prospects  apparently  of  the  same  character.  Such  common  stocks
could be bought at most times, except in the upper ranges of a bull
market,  at  moderate  prices  in  relation  to  their  indicated  intrinsic
values.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  because  of  the  present  tendency  of
investors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorous
issues,  I  should  hazard  the  statement  that  these  middle-ground
stocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independently
determinable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety factor sup-
plied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to
destroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues. Further-
more, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for
penetrating  analysis  of  the  past  record  and  for  discriminating
choice  in  the  area  of  future  prospects,  to  which  can  be  added  the
higher assurance of safety conferred by diversification.

When  Phaëthon  insisted  on  driving  the  chariot  of  the  Sun,  his
father,  the  experienced  operator,  gave  the  neophyte  some  advice
which  the  latter  failed  to  follow—to  his  cost.  Ovid  summed  up
Phoebus Apollo’s counsel in three words:

Medius tutissimus ibis
You will go safest in the middle course

I think this principle holds good for investors and their security

analyst advisers.

5. A Case History: Aetna Maintenance Co.

The first part of this history is reproduced from our 1965 edition,
where it appeared under the title “A Horrible Example.” The sec-
ond part summarizes the later metamorphosis of the enterprise.

We think it might have a salutary effect on our readers’ future
attitude toward new common-stock offerings if we cited one “hor-
rible example” here in some detail. It is taken from the first page of
Standard  &  Poor’s  Stock  Guide, and  illustrates  in  extreme  fashion
the  glaring  weaknesses  of  the  1960–1962  flotations,  the  extraordi-
nary overvaluations given them in the market, and the subsequent
collapse.

In  November  1961,  154,000  shares  of  Aetna  Maintenance  Co.
common  were  sold  to  public  at  $9  and  the  price  promptly
advanced to $15. Before the financing the net assets per share were
about $1.20, but they were increased to slightly over $3 per share
by the money received for the new shares.

The sales and earnings prior to the financing were:

In 1962 the price fell to 22⁄3, and in 1964 it sold as low as 7⁄8. No divi-
dends were paid during this period.

COMMENT: This was much too small a business for public partic-
ipation. The stock was sold—and bought—on the basis of one good
year; the results previously had been derisory. There was nothing in

576

Appendixes

the nature of this highly competitive business to insure future sta-
bility. At the high price soon after issuance the heedless public was
paying much more per dollar of earnings and assets than for most
of  our  large  and  strong  companies.  This  example  is  admittedly
extreme, but it is far from unique; the instances of lesser, but inex-
cusable, overvaluations run into the hundreds.

Sequel 1965–1970

In 1965 new interests came into the company. The unprofitable
building-maintenance business was sold out, and the company em-
barked in an entirely different venture: making electronic devices.
The name was changed to Haydon Switch and Instrument Co. The
earnings  results  have  not  been  impressive.  In  the  five  years
1965–1969 the enterprise showed average earnings of only 8 cents
per share of “old stock,” with 34 cents earned in the best year, 1967.
However, in true modern style, the company split the stock 2 for 1 in
1968. The market price also ran true to Wall Street form. It advanced
from 7⁄8 in 1964 to the equivalent of 161⁄2 in 1968 (after the split). The
price now exceeded the record set in the enthusiastic days of 1961.
This time the overvaluation was much worse than before. The stock
was now selling at 52 times the earnings of its only good year, and
some 200 times its average earnings. Also, the company was again to
report a deficit in the very year that the new high price was estab-
lished. The next year, 1969, the bid price fell to $1.

QUESTIONS:  Did  the  idiots  who  paid  $8+  for  this  stock  in  1968
know  anything  at  all  about  the  company’s  previous  history,  its
five-year  earnings  record,  its  asset  value  (very  small)?  Did  they
have any idea of how much—or rather how little—they were get-
ting for their money? Did they care? Has anyone on Wall Street any
responsibility at all for the regular recurrence of completely brain-
less,  shockingly  widespread,  and  inevitable  catastrophic  specula-
tion in this kind of vehicle?

6. Tax Accounting for NVF’s Acquisition of Sharon 
Steel Shares

1. NVF acquired 88% of Sharon stock in 1969, paying for each
share  $70  in  NVF  5%  bonds,  due  1994,  and  warrants  to  buy  11⁄2

Appendixes

577

shares  of  NVF  at  $22  per  share.  The  initial  market  value  of  the
bonds  appears  to  have  been  only  43%  of  par,  while  the  warrants
were  quoted  at  $10  per  NVF  share  involved.  This  meant  that  the
Sharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-
rants  for  each  share  turned  in,  a  total  of  $45  per  share.  (This  was
about the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price
for the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-
ference  between  this  book  value  and  the  market  value  of  Sharon
stock  amounted  to  about  $21  million  on  the  1,415,000  shares  of
Sharon acquired.

2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three
things: (a) To treat  the  issuance  of  the  bonds  as  equivalent  to  a
“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from
income for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.
(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest on
the “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b) To offset this
bond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-
ing of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the
cost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This
would  correspond,  in  reverse  fashion,  to  the  required  practice  of
charging income each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-
tions  in  excess of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  acquired.)  (c) The
beauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save
initially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes from
these  two  annual  entries,  because  the  amortization  of  bond  dis-
count could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization
of “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-
able income.

3. This  accounting  treatment  is  reflected  in  both  the  consoli-
dated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF
for 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of
Sharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-
essary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of
the common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no other
that  we  know,  the  warrants  were  assigned  a  substantial  value  in
the balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatory
note).

7. Technological Companies as Investments

In the Standard & Poor’s services in mid-1971 there were listed
about  200  companies  with  names  beginning  with  Compu-,  Data,
Electro-, Scien-, Techno-. About half of these belonged to some part
of the computer industry. All of them were traded in the market or
had made applications to sell stock to the public.

A total of 46 such companies appeared in the S & P Stock Guide
for  September  1971.  Of  these,  26  were  reporting  deficits,  only  six
were  earning  over  $1  per  share,  and  only  five  were  paying  divi-
dends.

In the December 1968 Stock Guide there had appeared 45 compa-
nies  with  similar  technological  names.  Tracing  the  sequel  of  this
list, as shown in the September 1971 Guide, we find the following
developments:

COMMENT:  It  is  virtually  certain  that  the  many  technological
companies  not  included  in  the  Guide in  1968  had  a  poorer  subse-
quent record than those that were included; also that the 12 compa-
nies dropped from the list did worse than those that were retained.
The  harrowing  results  shown  by  these  samples  are  no  doubt  rea-
sonably  indicative  of  the  quality  and  price  history  of  the  entire
group of “technology” issues. The phenomenal success of IBM and
a  few  other  companies  was  bound  to  produce  a  spate  of  public
offerings of new issues in their fields, for which large losses were
virtually guaranteed.

of the large and highly profitable IBM, which is not one of the DJIA
30 issues.

cates  that  the  rates  charged  for  residential  telephone  services
were somewhat less in 1970 than in 1960.

4. Reported in the Wall Street Journal, October, 1970.

Chapter 3. A Century of Stock-Market History: 
The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972

1. Both  Standard  &  Poor’s  and  Dow  Jones  have  separate  averages  for
public utilities and transportation (chiefly railroad) companies. Since
1965 the New York Stock Exchange has computed an index represent-
ing the movement of all its listed common shares.

2. Made by the Center for Research in Security Prices of the University
of Chicago, under a grant from the Charles E. Merrill Foundation.
3. This was first written in early 1971 with the DJIA at 940. The contrary
view  held  generally  on  Wall  Street  was  exemplified  in  a  detailed
study which reached a median valuation of 1520 for the DJIA in 1975.
This  would  correspond  to  a  discounted  value  of,  say,  1200  in  mid-
1971.  In  March  1972  the  DJIA was  again  at  940  after  an  intervening
decline to 798. Again, Graham was right. The “detailed study” he men-
tions was too optimistic by an entire decade: The Dow Jones Industrial
Average did not close above 1520 until December 13, 1985!

Chapter 4. General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

1. A higher  tax-free  yield,  with  sufficient  safety,  can  be  obtained  from
certain Industrial Revenue Bonds, a relative newcomer among financial
inventions. They would be of interest particularly to the enterprising
investor.

Chapter 5. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

1. Practical Formulas for Successful Investing, Wilfred Funk, Inc., 1953.
2. In current mathematical approaches to investment decisions, it has be-
come standard practice to define “risk” in terms of average price varia-
tions or “volatility.” See, for example, An Introduction to Risk and Return,
by Richard A. Brealey, The M.I.T. Press, 1969. We find this use of the
word  “risk”  more  harmful  than  useful  for  sound  investment  deci-
sions—because it places too much emphasis on market fluctuations.

3. All 30 companies in the DJIA met this standard in 1971.

Chapter 6. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor:
Negative Approach

1. In  1970  the  Milwaukee  road  reported  a  large  deficit.  It  suspended
interest payments on its income bonds, and the price of the 5% issue
fell to 10.

2. For example: Cities Service $6 first preferred, not paying dividends,
sold at as low as 15 in 1937 and at 27 in 1943, when the accumulations
had  reached  $60  per  share.  In  1947  it  was  retired  by  exchange  for
$196.50 of 3% debentures for each share, and it sold as high as 186.
3. An  elaborate  statistical  study  carried  on  under  the  direction  of  the
National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that such has actu-
ally  been  the  case.  Graham  is  referring  to  W.  Braddock  Hickman, 
Corporate  Bond  Quality  and  Investor  Experience (Princeton University
Press,  1958).  Hickman’s  book  later  inspired  Michael  Milken  of  Drexel
Burnham  Lambert  to  offer  massive  high-yield  financing  to  companies
with  less  than  sterling  credit  ratings,  helping  to  ignite  the  leveraged-
buyout and hostile takeover craze of the late 1980s.

4. A representative  sample  of  41  such  issues  taken  from  Standard  &
Poor’s  Stock  Guide shows  that  five  lost  90%  or  more  of  their  high
price, 30 lost more than half, and the entire group about two-thirds.
The  many  not  listed  in  the  Stock  Guide undoubtedly  had  a  larger
shrinkage on the whole.

Chapter 7. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: 
The Positive Side

1. See,  for  example,  Lucile  Tomlinson,  Practical  Formulas  for  Successful
Investing; and  Sidney  Cottle  and  W.  T.  Whitman,  Investment  Timing:
The Formula Approach, both published in 1953.

2. A company  with  an  ordinary  record  cannot,  without  confusing  the
term,  be  called  a  growth  company  or  a  “growth  stock”  merely
because its proponent expects it to do better than the average in the
future. It is just a “promising company.” Graham is making a subtle but
important point: If the definition of a growth stock is a company that will
thrive in the future, then that’s not a definition at all, but wishful thinking.
It’s like calling a sports team “the champions” before the season is over.
This wishful thinking persists today; among mutual funds, “growth” port-
folios describe their holdings as companies with “above-average growth

582

Endnotes

potential”  or  “favorable  prospects  for  earnings  growth.”  A  better  defini-
tion might be companies whose net earnings per share have increased
by  an  annual  average  of  at  least  15%  for  at  least  five  years  running.
(Meeting this definition in the past does not ensure that a company will
meet it in the future.)

3. See Table 7-1.
4. Here  are  two  age-old  Wall  Street  proverbs  that  counsel  such  sales:
“No tree grows to Heaven” and “A bull may make money, a bear may
make money, but a hog never makes money.”

5. Two studies are available. The first, made by H. G. Schneider, one of
our students, covers the years 1917–1950 and was published in June
1951  in  the Journal  of  Finance. The  second  was  made  by  Drexel  Fire-
stone,  members  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  and  covers  the
years 1933–1969. The data are given here by their kind permission.
6. See  pp.  393–395,  for  three  examples  of  special  situations  existing  in

1971.

Chapter 8. The Investor and Market Fluctuations

1. Except, perhaps, in dollar-cost averaging plans begun at a reasonable

price level.

2. But  according  to  Robert  M.  Ross,  authority  on  the  Dow  theory,  the
last  two  buy  signals,  shown  in  December  1966  and  December  1970,
were well below the preceding selling points.

3. The top three ratings for bonds and preferred stocks are Aaa, Aa, and
A, used by Moody’s, and AAA, AA, A by Standard & Poor’s. There
are others, going down to D.

4. This  idea  has  already  had  some  adoptions  in  Europe—e.g.,  by  the
state-owned Italian electric-energy concern on its “guaranteed float-
ing rate loan notes,” due 1980. In June 1971 it advertised in New York
that the annual rate of interest paid thereon for the next six months
would be 81⁄8%.

One such flexible arrangement was incorporated in The Toronto-
Dominion  Bank’s  “7%–8%  debentures,”  due  1991,  offered  in  June
1971. The bonds pay 7% to July 1976 and 8% thereafter, but the holder
has the option to receive his principal in July 1976.

Chapter 9. Investing in Investment Funds

1. The  sales  charge  is  universally  stated  as  a  percentage  of  the  selling
price,  which  includes  the  charge,  making  it  appear  lower  than  if
applied to net asset value. We consider this a sales gimmick unwor-
thy of this respectable industry.

1969.

3. See definition of “letter stock” on p. 579.
4. Title  of  a  book  first  published  in  1852.  The  volume  described  the
“South Sea Bubble,” the tulip mania, and other speculative binges of
the  past.  It  was  reprinted  by  Bernard  M.  Baruch,  perhaps  the  only
continuously successful speculator of recent times, in 1932. Comment:
That was locking the stable door after the horse was stolen. Charles
Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds
(Metro Books, New York, 2002) was first published in 1841. Neither a
light  read  nor  always  strictly  accurate,  it  is  an  extensive  look  at  how 
large numbers of people often believe very silly things—for instance, that
iron can be transmuted into gold, that demons most often show up on
Friday  evenings,  and  that  it  is  possible  to  get  rich  quick  in  the  stock 
market. For a more factual account, consult Edward Chancellor’s Devil
Take  the  Hindmost (Farrar,  Straus  &  Giroux,  New  York,  1999);  for  a
lighter  take,  try  Robert  Menschel’s  Markets,  Mobs,  and  Mayhem:  A 
Modern  Look  at  the  Madness  of  Crowds ( John  Wiley  &  Sons,  New 
York, 2002).

Chapter 10. The Investor and His Advisers

1. The  examinations  are  given  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Financial
Analysts, which is an arm of the Financial Analysts Federation. The
latter now embraces constituent societies with over 50,000 members.
2. The  NYSE  had  imposed  some  drastic  rules  of  valuation  (known  as
“haircuts”)  designed  to  minimize  this  danger,  but  apparently  they
did not help sufficiently.

3. New offerings may now be sold only by means of a prospectus pre-
pared  under  the  rules  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.
This  document  must  disclose  all  the  pertinent  facts  about  the  issue
and issuer, and it is fully adequate to inform the prudent investor as to
the exact nature of the security offered him. But the very copiousness

584

Endnotes

of  the  data  required  usually  makes  the  prospectus  of  prohibitive
length. It is generally agreed that only a small percentage of individu-
als buying  new  issues  read  the  prospectus  with  thoroughness.  Thus
they are still acting mainly not on their own judgment but on that of
the house selling them the security or on the recommendation of the
individual salesman or account executive.

Chapter 11. Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: 
General Approach

1. Our textbook, Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd,
Sidney  Cottle,  and  Charles  Tatham  (McGraw-Hill,  4th  ed.,  1962),
retains  the  title  originally  chosen  in  1934,  but  it  covers  much  of  the
scope of financial analysis.

2. With  Charles  McGolrick,  Harper  &  Row,  1964,  reissued  by  Harper-

Business, 1998.

3. These figures are from Salomon Bros., a large New York bond house.
4. At  least  not  by  the  great  body  of  security  analysts  and  investors.
Exceptional  analysts,  who  can  tell  in  advance  what  companies  are
likely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and capability
to make it, may have continued success with this work. For details of
such  an  approach  see  Philip  Fisher,  Common  Stocks  and  Uncommon
Profits, Harper & Row, 1960.

5. On  p.  295  we  set  forth  a  formula  relating  multipliers  to  the  rate  of

expected growth.

6. Part  of  the  fireworks  in  the  price  of  Chrysler  was  undoubtedly
inspired  by  two  two-for-one  stock  splits  taking  place  in  the  single
year  1963—an  unprecedented  phenomenon  for  a  major  company. In
the early 1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming
back from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing
stocks  in  America.  However,  identifying  managers  who  can  lead  great
corporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took
over  Sunbeam  Corp.  in  1996  after  restructuring  Scott  Paper  Co.  (and
driving its stock price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him as
little short of the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham who
used  improper  accounting  and  false  financial  statements  to  mislead
Sunbeam’s  investors—including  the  revered  money  managers  Michael
Price and Michael Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissection
of  Dunlap’s  career,  see  John  A.  Byrne,  Chainsaw (HarperCollins,  New
York, 1999).

7. Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true value”
of  a  growth  stock,  but  only  that  it  approximates  the  results  of  the
more elaborate calculations in vogue.

Chapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings

1. Our  recommended  method  of  dealing  with  the  warrant  dilution  is
discussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the war-
rants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock
as a whole.

Chapter 13. A Comparison of Four Listed Companies

1. In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!

Chapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor

1. Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the actual
average price of the DJIA list was about $53 per share in early 1972.
2. In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current
assets  equal  to  twice  current  liabilities,  and  only  two  failed  to  have
net current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the num-
ber in each category had grown from two to twelve.

3. But  note  that  their  combined  market  action  from  December  1970  to
early 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates once
again  that  no  system  or  formula  will  guarantee  superior  market
results. Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is
getting his money’s worth.

4. As  a  consequence  we  must  exclude  the  majority  of  gas  pipeline
stocks,  since  these  enterprises  are  heavily  bonded.  The  justification
for this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which
“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too
complicated for the needs of a defensive investor.

Chapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor

1. Mutual  Funds  and  Other  Institutional  Investors:  A New  Perspective,
I. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We should
add that the 1966–1970 results of many of the funds we studied were

586

Endnotes

somewhat better than those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock com-
posite and considerably better than those of the DJIA.

2. Personal  note:  Many  years  before  the  stock-market  pyrotechnics  in
that particular company the author was its “financial vice-president”
at the princely salary of $3,000 per annum. It was then really in the
fireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice pres-
ident of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer of
fireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and
no longer exists in independent form.

3. The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be
mathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero point.

Chapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants

1. This  point  is  well  illustrated  by  an  offering  of  two  issues  of  Ford
Motor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One was
a 20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 71⁄2%. The other was a 25-year
bond,  subordinated  to  the  first  in  order  of  claim  and  yielding  only
41⁄2%; but it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its
then price of 681⁄2. To obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave
up 40% of income and accepted a junior-creditor position.

2. Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low
as 38 while the $5 preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thus
grown from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more the
desirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar-
ket to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the pre-
ferred over the common in December 1970 had already been made up
by its higher dividend.)

Chapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories

1. See,  for  example,  the  article  “Six  Flags  at  Half  Mast,”  by  Dr.  A.  J.

Briloff, in Barron’s, January 11, 1971.

Chapter 18. A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies

1. The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAA Enterprises tried to
enter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a pro-

Endnotes

587

found and paradoxical observation: The more money a company makes,
the more likely it is to face new competition, since its high returns signal
so clearly that easy money is to be had. The new competition, in turn, will
lead  to  lower  prices  and  smaller  profits.  This  crucial  point  was  over-
looked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that early
winners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.

Chapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy

1. Analytical  studies  have  shown  that  in  the  typical  case  a  dollar  paid
out in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-
ket  price  as  had  a  dollar  of  undistributed  earnings.  This  point  was
well  illustrated  by  the  public-utility  group  for  a  number  of  years
before  1950.  The  low-payout  issues  sold  at  low  multipliers  of  earn-
ings,  and  proved  to  be  especially  attractive  buys  because  their  divi-
dends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much
more uniform for the industry.

Chapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept 
of Investment

1. This  argument  is  supported  by  Paul  Hallingby,  Jr.,  “Speculative
Opportunities  in  Stock-Purchase  Warrants,”  Analysts’ Journal, third
quarter 1947.

Postscript

1. Veracity  requires  the  admission  that  the  deal  almost  fell  through
because the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would
be 100% covered by asset value. A future $300 million or more in mar-
ket  gain  turned  on,  say,  $50,000  of  accounting  items.  By  dumb  luck
they got what they insisted on.

However, developing strategies for dealing with people is more complex. Messaging speed is instantaneous. Communication media have multiplied. Networks have expanded beyond borders, industries, and ideologies. Yet rather than making the principles in this book obsolete, these major changes have made Carnegie’s principles more relevant than ever. They represent the foundation of every sound strategy, whether you are marketing a brand, apologizing to your spouse, or pitching to investors. And if you don’t begin with the right foundation, it is easy to send the wrong message, to offend, or to fall embarrassingly short of your objective. “Precision of communication,” insisted American writer James Thurber, “is important, more important than ever, in our era of hair-trigger balances, when a false, or misunderstood, word may create as much disaster as a sudden thoughtless act.”1 Consider the era of hair-trigger balances in which we live today, more than fifty years after Thurber penned the phrase. The stakes are higher. Amid the amalgam of media, distinction is more difficult. Every word, every nonverbal cue, every silent stare is scrutinized as it has never been before. One wrong move can have far greater implications. Still, every interaction from your first good morning to your last goodnight is an opportunity to win friends and influence others in a positive way. Those who succeed daily lead quite successful lives. But this sort of success comes at a philanthropic price some aren’t willing to pay. It is not as simple as being ad-wise or savvy about social media. “The art of communication is the language of leadership,” said the presidential speechwriter James Humes.2 In other words, people skills that lead to influence have as much to do with the messenger—a leader in some right—as with the medium. This book will show you how and why this is true, just as it has shown more than fifty million readers around the globe, including world leaders, media luminaries, business icons, and bestselling authors. What all come to understand is that there is no such thing as a neutral exchange. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse.3 The best among us leave others a little better with every nod, every inflection, every interface. This one idea embodied daily has significant results. It will improve your relationships and expand your influence with others, yes. But it will do so because the daily exercise elicits greater character and compassion from you. Aren’t we all moved by altruism? “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.” Carnegie’s assertion remains relevant, albeit counterintuitive, because it reminds us the secret to progress with people is a measure of selflessness swept under the drift of the digital age. We live in an unprecedented era of self-help and self-promotion. We watch YouTube videos like the Double Rainbow go viral in a matter of weeks and garner the sort of global attention people used to break their backs for years, even decades, to obtain. We witness allegedly leaked sex videos create overnight celebrities. We watch talking heads and political pundits tear down their competition and elevate their ratings. We are daily tempted to believe that the best publicity strategy is a mix of gimmick and parody run through the most virally proficient medium. The temptation is too much for many. But for those who understand the basics of human relations, there is a far better, far more reputable, far more sustainable way to operate. While self-help and self-promotion are not inherently deficient pursuits, problems always arise when the stream of self-actualization is dammed within us. You are one in seven billion—your progress is not meant for you alone. The sooner you allow this truth to shape your communication decisions, the sooner you will see that the quickest path to personal or professional growth is not in hyping yourself to others but in sharing yourself with them. No author has presented the path as clearly as Dale Carnegie. Yet perhaps even he could not have imagined how the path to meaningful collaboration would become an autobahn of lasting, lucrative influence today. More Than Clever Communication While the hyperfrequency of our interactions has made proficient people skills more advantageous than ever, influential people must be more than savvy communicators. Communication is simply an outward manifestation of our thoughts, our intentions, and our conclusions about the people around us. “Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.”4 These internal drivers are the primary differentiator between today’s leader and today’s relational leech. The two highest levels of influence are achieved when (1) people follow you because of what you’ve done for them and (2) people follow you because of who you are. In other words, the highest levels of influence are reached when generosity and trustworthiness surround your behavior. This is the price of great, sustainable impact, whether two or two million people are involved. Yet it is only when generosity and trust are communicated artfully and authentically that the benefits are mutual. Because we live in an age when celebrity influence can be borrowed like credit lines and media coverage can be won by squeaky wheels, it is all the more critical that every communication opportunity matter—that every medium you use be filled with messages that build trust, convey gratitude, and add value to the recipients. The one thing that has not changed since Carnegie’s time is that there is still a clear distinction between influence that is borrowed (and is difficult to sustain) and influence that is earned (and is as steady as earth’s axis). Carnegie was the master of influence that is earned. Consider a few of his foundational principles—don’t criticize, condemn, or complain; talk about others’ interests; if you’re wrong, admit it; let others save face. Such principles don’t make you a clever conversationalist or a resourceful raconteur. They remind you to consider others’ needs before you speak. They encourage you to address difficult subjects honestly and graciously. They prod you to become a kinder, humbler manager, spouse, colleague, salesperson, and parent. Ultimately, they challenge you to gain influence in others’ lives not through showmanship or manipulation but through a genuine habit of expressing greater respect, empathy, and grace. Your reward? Rich, enduring friendships. Trustworthy transactions. Compelling leadership. And amid today’s mass of me-isms, a very distinguishing trademark. The original book has been called the bestselling self-help book of all time. From a modern standpoint this is a misnomer. “Self-help” was not a phrase Carnegie used. It was the moniker assigned to the genre created by the blockbuster success of How to Win Friends. The irony is that Carnegie would not endorse all of today’s self-help advice. He extolled action that sprang from genuine interest in others. He taught principles that flowed from an underlying delight in helping others succeed. Were the book recategorized, How to Win Friends would be more appropriately deemed the bestselling soul-help book in the world. For it is the soulish underpinning of the Golden Rule that Carnegie extracted so well. The principles herein are more than self-help or self-promotion handles. They are soulful strategies for lasting, lucrative progress in your conversations, your collaborations, your company. The implications are significant. By applying the principles you will not only become a more compelling person with more influence in others’ lives; you will fulfill a philanthropic purpose every day. Imagine this effect compounded over the dozens of daily interactions the digital age affords you. Imagine the effect if dozens of people throughout an organization followed suit. Winning friends and influencing people today is no small matter. On the continuum of opportunities, it is your greatest and most constant occasion to make sustainable progress with others. And what success does not begin with relationships? Starting Soft The business community tends to patronize soft skills, as Carnegie’s principles have been called, as if to conclude they are complementary to hard skills at best. This is backward. A permanent paradigm shift is necessary if you want to make the most of your interactions, let alone this book. Soft skills such as compassion and empathy drive hard skills such as programming, operations, and design to a rare effectiveness. How? Soft skills link hard skills to operational productivity, organizational synergy, and commercial relevance because all require sound human commitment. Does the hard-skilled manager who sits in lofty obscurity lording over his reports trump the hard-skilled manager who walks among his people, who is known, seen, and respected by his people? While the former might win some success by forcing his hand for a time, his influence is fatally flawed because his power is not bestowed on him by his people. His influence is only a veneer of leverage with a short shelf life. In his book Derailed, corporate psychologist Tim Irwin details the downfall of six high-profile CEOs over the last decade. Every downfall was triggered by the executive’s inability to connect with employees on a tangible, meaningful level. In other words, every derailment was the result of a hard skill surplus coupled with a soft skill deficit—corporate savvy minus compelling influence. And such failings are no less our own. Theirs were public, but ours are often as palpable. We lose the faith of friends, family members, and others when we follow the steps of relational success without feeding the essence of the relationships—the measuring and meeting of human needs. What makes so many well-meaning people get this wrong? Perhaps the ethereal nature of soft skills leads us astray. We can lean unilaterally on what is measurable. Hard skills can be tested, taught, and transferred. Most business books are written with this in mind because we can pinpoint hard skill progress—individually and corporately—with charts, metrics, and reports. Not so of soft skills. They can be difficult to reduce to steps. They are often messy and only crudely quantifiable through better responses and improved relationships. Yet aren’t these the best measurements of all? What good is a list of accomplishments if they have led to relational regress? When any progress is bookended by self-promotion and self-indulgence, it will not last. On a small scale, do we keep friends whose actions regularly demonstrate the relationship is about them? When we learn a person’s behavior has an ulterior motive, he has less influence with us than someone we’ve met only once. The relationship is doomed unless he confesses and makes a change. Even then, a residue of skepticism will remain. On a large scale, do we remain loyal to brands that regularly demonstrate either an inability or an unwillingness to embrace our needs and desires? Gone are the days when the majority of companies tell consumers what they need. We live in a day when consumers hold the majority on design, manufacturing, and marketing decisions. “Going green” was once a small, well-meaning ad campaign for a handful of products. The collective consumer voice has made it a mandatory marketing mantra. Individuals and companies insensitive to soft skill success miss the mark today. Some insist you can’t teach soft skill instincts. It is true if you approach soft skills with a hard skill methodology. Carnegie didn’t make this mistake. He discovered that altruistic instincts rise to the surface not from shrewd step-by-step strategy but from the exercising of core desires. When we behave in ways that befriend and positively influence others, we tap a deeper well of inspiration, meaning, and resourcefulness. Hardwired into all of us is the desire for honest communication—to understand and be understood. Beyond that, for authentic connection—to be known, accepted, and valued. Beyond that still, for successful collaboration—to work together toward meaningful achievement be it commercial success, corporate victory, or relational longevity. The crowning essence of success lies along a spectrum between authentic human connection (winning friends) and meaningful, progressive impact (influencing people). “There is no hope of joy,” concluded the French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, “except in human relations.”5 How does one access these soulful skills that power effective communication, meaningful connection, and progressive collaboration? We must first remember that today’s relational successes are not measured on the scale of media—which ones to use and how many friends, fans, or followers one can accumulate. They are measured on the scale of meaning. Become meaningful in your interactions and the path to success in any endeavor is simpler and far more sustainable. The reason? People notice. People remember. People are moved when their interactions with you always leave them a little better. Meaning rules the effectiveness of every medium. Once you have something meaningful to offer, you can then choose the most proficient media for your endeavor. However, when you put the medium before the meaning, your message is in danger of becoming, in the words of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, “a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”6 The advent of tweets and status updates, while providing convenient ways to keep friends, family, and colleagues in the loop, have created an onslaught of such sound and fury. But it is not only the messages going out at 140 characters or less that are at risk of signifying nothing. Any medium carrying a message that lacks meaning will fall short of its intention: a television ad, a department memo, a client email, a birthday card. With so few media in his day, Carnegie didn’t need to thoroughly address both sides of this equation. He could focus on how to be meaningful in person, on the phone, and in letters. Today, we must thoroughly consider both the meanings and the media of our messages. Straightforward Advice for Succeeding with People Today “Simple truths,” wrote the French essayist Vauvenargues, “are a relief from grand speculations.”7 The reason How to Win Friends and Influence People remains a top seller to this day, moving more than 250,000 units in the United States alone in 2010, is that the principles within it are simple yet timeless. The underlying wisdom is straightforward yet transcendent. Since the inception of Carnegie’s first course on the subject in 1912, his simple truths have illuminated the most effective ways to become a person others look to for opinions, advice, and leadership. If there is therefore any opportunity in rewriting the classic tome, it is not in the context of supplanting its advice. The prose threaded through the pages before you is in a different context: reframing Carnegie’s advice for a wholly different era—the same timeless principles viewed through a modern lens and applied with digital, global mind-set. The opportunities to win friends and influence people today are exponentially greater than they were in Dale Carnegie’s time. Yet when you break the opportunities down the numbers matter little because “the entire universe, with one trifling exception, is [still] composed of others.”8 It is true, writes 50 Self-Help Classics author Tom Butler-Bowdon of How to Win Friends, that “there is a strange inconsistency between the brazenness of the title and much of what is actually in the book.”9 View this book’s title through today’s skeptical lens and you might miss its magic. The book is above all a treatise on applying the unmatched combination of authentic empathy, strategic connection, and generous leadership. It is important to remember that in Carnegie’s time the many media of veneered identities (websites, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) and gimmick-laden persuasion (pop-up ads, celebrity endorsements, televangelism) were not around. The idea of winning friends had not been reduced to an “accept” button. The idea of influencing people did not include the baggage of a half century’s worth of inflated ad campaigns, corporate deception, and double-living luminaries. Carnegie had an intuitive reason for identifying his title the way he did. Back then, if you didn’t foster a friendship, influencing a person was nearly impossible. Social media didn’t exist. Digital connections were not available. In fact, you rarely did business with a person you did not know in a tangible way. The average person had only three ways to connect with another: face-to-face, by letter, or by telephone. Face-to-face was the expectation. Today it is the exception. While indirect influence via celebrity or social status existed in Carnegie’s time, it was neither instant nor viral like it is today. Friendship was once the bridge to everyday sway. You earned friends with the firm shake of a hand, a warm smile, and an altruistic body of activity. You were worthy of the influence that resulted. The cause and effect are not so tidy today. Consider the 2010 issue of Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential People in the World.” With more than six million Twitter followers, Lady Gaga made the list.10 There is no need to discuss whether she has influence over her massive fan base, which has since climbed over 10 million. If she nods to a certain brand of shoes or a certain bottle of water, the products move. The real discussion surrounds the value she ascribes to her relationships and to what end her influence leads. Should she seek the highest measure of both, her influence is a significant force. Should she seek only to increase the numbers, she will make more money but have no more impact than a crack Polaroid campaign. The inherent, relational value of influence has not changed. It is still the currency of interpersonal progress. Yet the plethora of communication media has made it possible to acquire dime-store versions. And you get what you pay for. While we live in an era when “noise plus naked equals celebrity,” this is not a book about soliciting friendships and exploiting influence, a path Carnegie described as originating “from the teeth out.”11 This is a human relations handbook that originates “from the heart out.” It is about winning friends the way your good grandfather won your wise grandmother’s heart—through sincere interest, heartfelt empathy, and honest appreciation. And it is about guiding the lasting influence that arises toward mutual progress and benefit. There is a right and effective way to do this, and Carnegie depicted it superbly. Seventy-five years later, the principles remain true, but some definitions have changed and ramifications have expanded. The trajectory of this book will thus be toward new explanation and application. How do we understand and utilize Carnegie’s principles in a digitized world? Certain clues can be derived from lists that didn’t exist in Carnegie’s time, such as Forbes magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies,” the Harvard Business Review’s “Best-Performing CEOs in the World,” and Time’s “100 Most Influential People” list, already mentioned. These clues, or at times warnings, have served as occasional guides for the context in which interpersonal success is achieved today. In the spirit of the original book, the pages that follow will also serve as a constant reminder that the reasons we do things are more important than the things we do. While the journey to applying Carnegie principles today is not as complicated as unplugging and returning to a reliance on telegrams, telephones, and tangible interface, it is also not as trite as injecting a little humanity into every aspect of your digital space. In general, the best practice is a judicious blend of personal touch and digital presence. Employing this blend begins with an honest assessment of your current situation. From here your path to progress with others is clear. What is your ratio of face-to-face versus digital interactions? For most people, email, texts, blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts are the primary ways they correspond with others. This presents new hurdles and new opportunities. By relying so heavily on digital communication, we lose a critical aspect of human interactions: nonverbal cues. When delivering bad news, it is difficult to show compassion and support without putting your hand on another’s shoulder. When explaining a new idea, it is difficult to convey the same level of enthusiasm through a phone call as you would if standing before your audience in person. How many times have you sent an email and had the recipient call you to clear the air when the air was already clear? Emotion is difficult to convey without nonverbal cues. The advent of video communication has knocked down some barriers, but video is only a small fraction of digital communication. And still it does not shepherd the highest standard of human dignity the way a face-to-face meeting can. The award-winning film Up in the Air makes this point. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a corporate downsizer flown around the country to fire people for companies who won’t do it themselves. Bingham excels at his job, which requires him to lay people off in a dignified, even inspiring manner. He has mastered a speech in which he encourages each person to embrace the new freedom. He even fights against his boss, who requires him to begin delivering layoffs via videoconference to decrease expenses. The great paradox, however, is that Bingham is a loner without one authentic relationship in his life, not even with his baby sister, whose wedding he may not attend. What appears to be an uncanny ability to empathize and connect with those he is firing is actually a confirmation of profound detachment. It is not until a personal experience shows him the raw significance of real human connection that he finally sees the truth. Then even he cannot follow his advice. We live in a driven, digital world where the full value of human connection is often traded for transactional proficiency. Many have mastered the ironic art of increasing touch points while simultaneously losing touch. The remedy is found neither in self-preservation (à la Ryan Bingham) nor in stimulating connection through stirring but shallow salesmanship. The former is a philosophical blunder. The latter is a strategic one. There is a threshold to today’s productivity, found at the very point where progress with people is supplanted by progress. Often it’s the sheer speed of communication that affects our judgment. Because we believe others expect immediate responses (as we do ourselves), we often don’t take the time to craft meaningful responses; we ignore the niceties of common courtesy; we say, “I can’t possibly apply these principles to a blog comment, to an email, at a virtual conference where I’m not even sure I can be heard.” But these interactions are when Carnegie’s principles are most valuable. It is in the common, everyday moments where altruistic actions most clearly stand out. We expect courtesy on first dates and follow-up meetings; we are impacted when the same courtesy shows up in a weekly progress report or a shared ride in the elevator. We expect humble eloquence in an ad campaign or a wedding speech; we are inspired when the same humble eloquence shows up in an email update or a text reply on a trivial matter. The difference, as they say, is in the details—the often subtle details of your daily interactions. Why do such details still matter in this digital age? Because “the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership and to arouse enthusiasm among people—that person is headed for higher earning power.” It is remarkable how much more relevant Carnegie’s words are today.   How to Win Friends and Influence Peoplein the Digital Age   Part 1Essentials of Engagement   1Bury Your Boomerangs Ask both Adolf Hitler and Martin Luther King Jr. for a basic definition of influence and you might get similar answers. Observe their biographical application of influence and you will discover their definitions couldn’t be more at odds. The tangible distinction begins with their words. Pit “How fortunate for leaders that men do not think” against “I am not interested in power for power’s sake but . . . in power that is moral, that is right and that is good,” and the divergence is obvious.1 The former maintains influence is the reward of the cunning, condescending cynic. The latter maintains influence is the reward of the trustworthy agent of the common good. Every day our words place us somewhere between the two disparate approaches. History details the results at either end. We communicate toward tearing others down or toward building others up. To this end, Carnegie was succinct in his advice: don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. But how much more difficult this seems today. To say we must be more mindful of our words is an understatement. With an immense digital canvas on which to communicate our thoughts comes an equally immense canvas of accountability called public access. “Digital communications have made it possible to reach more people in faster and cheaper ways,” explained bestselling Enchantment author Guy Kawasaki in a recent interview, “but a loser is still a loser. You could make the case that technology has made it possible to blow one’s reputation faster and easier than ever.” It is a good case indeed, and precisely today’s counterpoint of applying this principle. What was once a covert criticism can now get you fined. Ask Dr. Patrick Michael Nesbitt, a former Canadian family practice physician who was fined $40,000 for posting “vicious” and defamatory remarks on Facebook about the mother of his daughter.2 Or Ryan Babel, the Dutch striker of the Liverpool Football Club, who following a loss to Manchester United tweeted a link to a doctored picture of referee Howard Webb with the comment “And they call him one of the best referees. That’s a joke.” He was subsequently fined £10,000, about $16,000.3 Of Babel’s tweet, BBC blogger Ben Dirs noted, “Whereas a year ago Babel might have let off steam to his girlfriend, now he has this very convenient—and very tempting—tool at his fingertips that allows him to sound off to the world.”4 What was once a careless complaint among friends can now get you fired. A 2009 study by Proofpoint revealed that of U.S. companies with a thousand or more employees, 8 percent reported removing someone for their comments on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn.5 Getting more specific, a recent online issue of the Huffington Post describes thirteen Facebook posts that got people dismissed from their jobs.6 Included in the list are: • A waitress at a pizza restaurant who posted her complaint and profane criticism of two customers after receiving a small tip for waiting on their table for three hours, which included staying an hour past her shift. “Thanks for eating at Brixx,” she snarked, and then went on to deride the customers, calling them “cheap.”7 • A game-day employee at the Philadelphia Eagles stadium who posted a derogatory status update in which he condemned the team for allowing beloved safety Brian Dawkins to sign with the Denver Broncos. “Dan is [expletive] devastated about Dawkins signing with Denver . . . Dam Eagles R Retarted!!”8 • Seven employees of a Canadian grocery store chain called Farm Boy who created the Facebook group “I got Farm Boy’d” that mocked customers and included “verbal attacks against customers and staff.”9 At times one can wonder whether criticism has become more prevalent than compassion and judgment more prevalent than grace in our communication media. There is no disputing that snark is chic. With so many opportunities to be heard, many seem keen on thrusting forth their right to speak when someone else is wrong, yet they just as quickly shrink into their right to remain silent when it is they who are wrong. Many are accustomed to holding a sword called the First Amendment in one hand and a shield called the Fifth in the other—all the while forgetting that to do so is to deem human relations a battlefield. In many ways this culture of criticism and complaint is the unfortunate reality. Yet the influential person understands that such indiscretions quicken the path to relational breakdown no matter how right you are or how wrong the other remains. Such tactics tear down far more often than they build up because they suggest an underlying, unilateral motive whether or not it exists. They subsequently move an interaction from tame to tense. It is no wonder we have more talking heads than true leaders today. Influence is always at stake, but many want nothing more than to state their case. Not only does it set a poor precedent, it does nothing but fuel the tension and increase the gap between a message and meaningful collaboration. However, when a true leader shows up, there is no disputing the converse effect. There have been few more compelling communicators than the deliverer of the Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln was long known as a man who approached tense situations with poise and grace. His reaction to a significant tactical error during a climactic moment of the Civil War is case in point. The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, General Robert E. Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was trapped. Here was the Union Army’s golden opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. With a surge of confidence, Lincoln ordered General George Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. The president telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action. Meade called a council of war. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of excuses to the president. Finally the Potomac receded and Lee crossed the river and escaped with his forces. Lincoln was furious. “What does this mean?” he cried to his son Robert. “Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there I could have whipped him myself.” In bitter disappointment, a normally restrained Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade what was, given his history, a harsh letter. My dear General, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few—no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now affect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it. It was a letter quite justified in being sent. Yet Lincoln never sent it. It was found among his papers after his death. What do you suppose kept the president from venting his great disappointment and understandable criticism? President Lincoln was a master communicator, and humility was at the heart of all he said. He must have considered that if he sent the letter, it would have relieved some of his frustration but simultaneously ignited resentment in General Meade, further impairing the man’s usefulness as a commander. Lincoln knew Meade had just been assigned to be commander of the Army of the Potomac only days before. He also knew Meade enjoyed a string of heroic successes. Certainly Meade was under a great deal of pressure, with the added burden of bad blood between him and some of those he was being asked to command. Had Lincoln brushed such details aside and sent his letter, he certainly would have won the battle of words, but he would have suffered loss in the war of influence. This does not mean General Meade did not deserve to be informed of his error. It does mean there was an ineffective way to inform him and an effective way. Lincoln did eventually convey to Meade his disappointment, but he did so in a dignifying manner. In choosing to graciously withhold the more cutting letter, Lincoln chose to retain and even increase his influence with Meade, who would go on to be a force for civic good in his hometown of Philadelphia until his death in 1872. Lincoln seemed to know, perhaps more than any other American president in history, when to hold his tongue and when silence was a graver mistake than speaking up. At the core of this skill was an understanding of one of the most foundational truths of human nature. We are self-preserving creatures who are instinctively compelled to defend, deflect, and deny all threats to our well-being, not the least of which are threats to our pride. Consider the steroids scandal in Major League Baseball. Of the list of 129 players linked to steroid and human growth hormone use via positive tests, the Mitchell Report, or implications by colleagues, only sixteen admitted use.10 Merely high-profile athletes with high-profile egos? Not so fast. Consider the last time a colleague came down on you for something you said or did. Are we to suppose his words made you want to give the guy a hug and buy him lunch? Or did you want to hide an open can of sardines in his desk? And that’s probably being nice. Neither you nor I enjoy being the subject of disapproval, whether or not it is deserved. “As much as we thirst for approval,” explained endocrinologist Hans Selye, “we dread condemnation.” When we attempt to use criticism to win an argument, to make a point, or to incite change, we are taking two steps backward. People can be led to change as horses can be led to water, but deprecation will rarely inspire the results you are aiming for. We are not merely speaking of public discourse. This is just as true in private conversation. Despite a zeitgeist of denigrating commentary in blogs, talk shows, and social media, the moment you use a medium to criticize, the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend. And when another is defensive, there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised. Everything you say is then filtered through skepticism, or worse, complete incredulity. In this way critical comments act like invisible boomerangs. They return on the thrower’s head. This occurs all the more quickly in a world where nearly everything we communicate is a keystroke, mike, or phone cam away from international exposure. Actor Mel Gibson learned an unfortunate lesson when the profane, racially charged condemnation he left on his ex-girlfriend’s voicemail was broadcast to the world. His global influence, once a significant force out of Hollywood, took a huge hit. A less volatile yet still damaging example occurred in July 2008, when a Fox News microphone picked up comments that, according to a CNN blog post, “the Reverend Jesse Jackson meant to deliver privately that seemed to disparage the presumptive Democratic nominee for appearing to lecture the black community on morality.”11 Despite Jackson’s instant public apology, his comments put a dent in his national influence on matters important to members of the black community. Furthermore, they placed into question his support of the Illinois senator Barack Obama, who would soon become the forty-fourth U.S. president. While most of us will avoid such widely publicized communication gaffes, before we rest in judgment of public figures who have stumbled, we would do ourselves well to consider what others might say should our worst private outburst become public. Better still to always follow a simple principle in our dealings with others—don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. We live in an age where the world can hear our words, where global accountability is a very real possibility, where our communication catastrophes can follow us indefinitely. Despite a global trend toward loose talk, it is neither wise nor necessary to criticize others to make your messages more effective, more important, or more newsworthy. The degree to which you can be heard today is best thought of not as a burden or blessing but as a responsibility. Those who accept this responsibility with humility, compassion, and a trustworthy zeal are much quicker to rise because others remain willing to listen. The people most widely respected within industries, companies, families, and groups of friends are those who are clear in their own viewpoints while remaining compassionate with those whose minds or behavior they would like to influence. Change by force of words is called coercion in some scenarios. There is a reason it is a crime. And while it might not be illegal between two coworkers, colleagues, or friends, we’d do just as well to avoid any sentiment of it. The simplest way is to focus on improving yourself instead of others.  • Shift your use of media from a spirit of exposé and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation. There is nothing wrong with informing your friends and fans, even about the things they might want to avoid, but the spirit of your information is key. Are you sharing information because you have an ax to grind? This sort of communication is better reserved for the safety of a trusted colleague’s couch. Even if people are already on your side, bragging and whining don’t bring them closer. If anything, such behavior makes them question whether they can trust you with their own mistakes and musings. • Resist badmouthing as a differentiation strategy. Its long-term effect is far more harmful than helpful. In a global economy, you never know when your greatest competitor will become your greatest collaborator. What will you do when the best road to business growth goes through someone with whom you have already burned the relational bridge? Competition is healthy and should be respected. Collaboration is critical and should be protected. • Make your messages meaningful by removing your agenda. Whether you are tweeting big news to a large fan base or updating a handful of board members, it’s wise to remember that no one wants a barrage of what’s important to you. Above all, the recipients of every bit and byte of your communication want value. If all you do is fill their ears, inboxes, and iPhones with descriptions of your latest problem or biggest gripe, they won’t listen for long. There is enough positive communication available to let another’s downbeat dogma fill our minds. • Calm yourself before communicating to another. When you are put off, the first five minutes are usually the most volatile. If you can train yourself to stuff the knee-jerk response, you will save yourself hours of backpedaling, back-scratching, and brownnosing down the road. While we all have our moments of indiscretion, there is little worse than a private indiscretion gone public. Save yourself the small trouble—and potentially extensive dilemma—by taking a step back before spouting something you might come to regret. While there is always something to say in appraisal of another, it is good to remember that there is always something to be said in appraisal of you, too. The ancient Jewish proverb provides appropriate wisdom here: “For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.”12 And while it is difficult at times to downplay our right to speak freely, a quick scan through history will remind you that the greatest influencers are those who held their tongue and swallowed their pride when the tide of negative emotion was arising, and instead let brevity, humility, and wisdom say far more than a critical tirade ever could. Perhaps there is no more memorable example than the prolific British writer G. K. Chesterton’s reply to an invitation by the Times to write an essay on the subject “What’s Wrong with the World?” Chesterton’s response: Dear Sirs, I am.Sincerely,G. K. Chesterton13 It is no surprise that a 1943 Time review of his book Orthodoxy reported that the robust writer’s most popular antagonist, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, called him “a man of colossal genius.”14 The same review referred to Shaw as the “friendly enemy” of his contemporary. Even Chesterton himself described the uniquely spirited relationship between the two as that of “cowboys in a silent movie that was never released.”15 The men were at odds on most every issue of their day, yet the spirit of their relationship never was, thanks in large part to Chesterton’s ability to keep his ego in check and respect the opinions of a man who couldn’t have disagreed with him more. The result was not uncommon in the writer’s life. Chesterton’s influence reached well beyond, perpetually engaging the minds of contemporaries such as Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and H. G. Wells. His book The Everlasting Man contributed to the Christian conversion of C. S. Lewis, then an atheist; his biography of Charles Dickens was largely responsible for creating a popular revival and serious scholarly reconsideration of Dickens’s work; his novel The Man Who Was Thursday inspired the Irish Republican leader Michael Collins with the idea “If you didn’t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out”; and his column in the Illustrated London News on September 18, 1909, had a profound effect on Mahatma Gandhi.16 To win friends and influence others in today’s world takes less than clever rhetoric. It takes the understated eloquence of grace and self-deprecation. If I am the problem with the world, and you are too, then we can stop worrying about who is right and get on with the work of making our world better. Bury your boomerangs and your words will forge a much quicker path to progress.   2Affirm What’s Good The Academy Award–winning film The King’s Speech tells the story of how a common man with an uncommon touch helped a stuttering prince become a king who would rally a nation. Prince Albert, Duke of York, had a stammering problem that hindered every part of his life. He had trouble telling stories to his children, trouble communicating in public speeches, and trouble speaking on the radio, the latest technology of the day. In searching out a cure for his ailment, the prince met with an Australian-born speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Logue’s methods were unconventional, in no small part because he believed stammering was as much a psychological problem as it was a physical one. The film shows how the prince, known as Bertie to his family, resists Logue’s entreaties, and the rest of the film recounts the rising tension between the men as the stakes are raised and Prince Albert, Duke of York, becomes King George VI, rex imperator, and world war looms. Finally, in a breakthrough moment as they prepare for his coronation, the soon-to-be king snaps and lets loose with all of his fears—that he will fail his nation and become a laughingstock for all of history. “Bertie,” Logue interjects, “you’re the bravest man that I know.” Bertie stops and considers the weight of those words. They portend life-changing impact. If Emerson was right when he remarked, “The ancestor of every action is a thought,” then what Logue had done was that most brilliant of influence strategies.1 He had introduced a thought that had theretofore never been considered. Bertie, the stammering prince, wasn’t weak. He wasn’t a loser or a laughingstock. The lifetime of teasing he’d endured and the very picture he had of himself weren’t telling the full story. There was something in him that was more fundamentally true, something that was good . . . maybe even great. Bertie embraced it. And ultimately he would become a different man because one person had the discernment to affirm in him something others had let his shortcomings obscure.2 Contrast Logue’s actions with those of dismissed NPR executive vice president Ron Schiller, who was caught on video articulating his disparagement of those political parties with which he did not associate. The primary difference between the two approaches is ultimately a matter of choice. Neither Bertie nor any political party is without its share of faults. It is not as though Lionel Logue had a more righteous subject with which to deal than did Ron Schiller. Both could find reasons to denounce their subjects. Logue simply took the more influential path, the path that held human dignity in the highest regard. Schiller took a path in which he forgot himself and his fellow humans. It isn’t difficult to see which path is wiser. One ancient and powerful Jewish parable involves a shepherd guarding one hundred sheep. They are under his care and he will not let them down. However, at roundup one evening he notices one is gone. Just one. Ninety-nine are safe and secure. What does the shepherd do? Does he say a prayer and hope the sheep shows up before a wolf nabs him? No, he pens the ninety-nine and goes looking. That one sheep is of such magnificent importance the shepherd cannot bear to see him left alone.3 Consider the message this sends to the sheep, not just the one but also the other ninety-nine who look to the shepherd for provision and protection. Now consider sending that same message to those you’d like to influence. Have you let them know just how valuable you think they are? There is great power in this simple principle, embodied regularly. We all have an innate, unquenchable desire to know we are valued, to know we matter. Yet affirming this in each other is among the most challenging things to do in our day and age. How obsessed we can be with the least important, most superficial things around. Weeks of life spent bantering about some celebrity’s latest style or some athlete’s latest sin. Hours observing the sociology of a household of clamoring college students. Even if we aren’t caught up in the often maniacal musings of pop culture, the demands on our time can still be so intense it seems difficult to dig down deep on anything. When we have a torrent of text messages, email bins that are overflowing, and networks offering ceaseless socializing, even that spouse we courted so passionately can become an inconvenience. Then there are the kids and grandparents and neighbors and so on. Who has time to affirm the good about anything save perhaps a neighbor’s new car or kitchen? That’s quick and painless. The problem is that quick and painless can also be mundane and meaningless. It is for these reasons that employing this principle matters so much today. Affirming the good in others should not however be confused with flattery. The difference? Genuine concern. A young, unkempt college student once asked Muhammad Ali what he should do with his life. He could not decide whether to continue his education or go out into the world to seek his fortune. It was clear he was leaning toward the latter. “Stay in college, get the education,” advised Ali. “If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they can make something out of you!”4 Ali was clearly making light of the situation. Ultimately he understood what the kid had likely been told his whole life, and he used a bit of levity to make a significant point: “Don’t give up so easily. Stay the course. Despite what you’ve been told, you matter and you can accomplish something great.” Affirmation, in contrast to flattery, requires seeing someone well enough to sense what to affirm, knowing someone well enough to be aware of what really matters. Flattery is usually an admittance of insensibility, a betrayal of trust. We say things we think we should say, but in reality we aren’t thinking at all. What message does flattery send? “You don’t matter enough for me to pay you much mind.” We have to overcome the temptation to live on autopilot. Bestselling author Rick Warren writes: We rush out the door and say, “Hey, how are you doing? Nice to see you.” We don’t even look people in the eye. We’re not really talking to them. If you do that, you’re going to miss a lot of potential in other people. . . . People aren’t things to be molded, like clay. That’s not your job. That’s manipulation—not leadership. People aren’t things to be molded; they’re lives to be unfolded. And that’s what true leaders do. They unfold the lives of others and help them reach their God-given potential.5 It is unreasonable to expect any of us to be on our A-game all of the time. Certainly we all miss opportunities we should have taken. But we can all measure our own scales over time. Do the messages you send with your written words, your spoken words, your presence, tip the scales toward affirmation or aloofness? The more they lean toward affirmation, the more influence you will gain with others. Emerson wrote, “Every man is entitled to be valued for his best moments.”6 Think about that for a moment. Which relationship is most strained in your life right now? What would it look like if you began focusing on that person’s best moments and sought to affirm them? This doesn’t presuppose the person doesn’t have his faults. It doesn’t even presume he has fewer faults than fine qualities. He might be a broken man with years of waste and wrongdoing in his wake. But one thing you can be sure of: if you aim to influence him to change, repeatedly pointing out his rap sheet will do you little good. If instead you begin to remind him of what he could be—not with hypothetical hype, but with his own history of goodness, of success, of insight, even if only a brief history—something inside him would have cause to awaken. He could begin to see what he can still be, despite what he has been. “When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be.”7 Few in history have understood the power of affirming the good in others better than the sixteenth president of the United States. With this one idea Abraham Lincoln kept the nation together. When he took the oath of office in March 1861 it was far from certain that there would ever be another inaugural address for a U.S. president. The same day he was sworn in, the Stars and Bars, the Confederacy’s new flag, was first raised over Montgomery, Alabama. In the months since Lincoln had been elected, seven states seceded from the Union. Everyone, friend and foe alike, wanted to know what this man had to say about the breakaway states. History now views this as one of the greatest speeches ever given, precisely because Lincoln wrote with a spirit of reconciliation. He wasn’t weak—he warned about the consequences of any attack on the Union. But he had the vision to affirm what was good at a moment when almost no one else could: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.”  What audacity this took. Seven states had already broken away and declared independence. War loomed. Friends? How could they possibly be seen as friends? Consider the last time a coworker betrayed you, a client lied to you, or a vendor failed to deliver on a promise. Was your first reaction to remember what he had done that was still good and true? Being disappointed, let down, or betrayed are among our most frustrating, maddening moments. Yet they also afford us rare moments to make a supreme impression. Do you recall a time someone surprised you with undeserved grace or unconditional forgiveness? The occurrence might have taken place many years ago, even during your childhood. Yet the person is likely a permanent part of your memory, with the emotion you felt still tangible. Ultimately, gaining influence is about setting yourself apart, stepping to a higher plane in the mind and heart of another. If all you do is act and react like anyone would, you will never be set apart. The reasons are simple. Competition for attention is constant. Communications are often a blur. It is challenging enough to become influential in today’s express-lane rat race. You need moments to show yourself altruistic and trustworthy, and seconds are all you are typically afforded. Were we all perfect individuals without a shortcoming in our lives, gaining influence through differentiation would fall solely on your ability to display a greater measure of trustworthiness than the others in a person’s sphere of influence. That’s a hard line to follow if your competition were all mistake-free individuals like yourself. In this scenario, competing for influence would look more like a beauty pageant (and some still treat it as such). That’s not the case. We are all imperfect beings full of shortcomings, and this affords us perhaps as many opportunities to affirm others after disagreement or disappointment as in the midst of affability. The key is to allow yourself no claim on circumstantial exemptions—use a spirit of affirmation to convey your thoughts about others whenever you can. Lest you make the mistake some do, a spirit of affirmation despite another’s faults is not a show of weakness or passivity. It is not a denial of justice, either, for mercy without justice is meaningless. Lincoln saw beyond the obvious and saw what might happen, and he pursued it. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union. Sometimes affirming the good in others will mean reminding ourselves of that very good that exists in another. Yes, Lincoln said, things are strained, but the bonds of amity are stronger still. There was an American history the South and the North both shared. They’d declared independence together, built a nation together, endured war together, and all needed to be reminded of it: “When again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Those final words are the summation of all that needed to be affirmed. There was something bigger than discord hidden deep within, a better and truer reality that needed permission to breathe. From a British monarch to a divided young nation, an appeal to the good in others turned a tense situation into a compelling challenge to change. This is not, as some might be tempted to think, an action that ignores the problems between you and another. Rather, it addresses them head-on but in a respectful, dignifying manner that is far more successful at propelling another toward repentance, reconciliation, or improvement. In You Can’t Lead with Your Feet on the Desk, Ed Fuller, president and managing director at Marriott International, asserts, “No worthwhile business relationship, whether with your own people or customers and partners, can endure without mutual respect. And as I’ve learned firsthand, showing adversaries that you regard them with admiration can resolve even violent conflicts.” Fuller then tells the story of a brawl that broke out between a Marriott attorney and a hotel owner in South America when the renegotiation of a management agreement escalated into a shouting match, and the two grown men began wrestling in a hotel conference room. The struggle continued without the intervention of bystanders until the hotel owner’s revolver hopped out of its holster and bumped across the floor. The wrestlers were immediately pried apart with damaged egos and no resolution. A few months passed without progress on the matter until a corporate lawyer and two company executives suggested the Marriott president pay the hotel owner a visit. Fuller describes the events that followed: I flew to his hometown and spent two days traveling with him, visiting his businesses, dining at his club, and mingling with his friends. As we got to know each other apart from our business dealings, our mutual respect grew. Seeing him in a different light allowed me to understand the strength of his commitment to his employees, family, and community. The differences at the heart of the conflict weren’t resolved, but I realized that he deserved my respect for who he was and what he had accomplished. A week after I left, we reached an agreement with the owner.8 Affirming what’s good, as with every principle in this book, is not just for grandly titled people at massive moments in human history. It is for this time and this age, where the spirit of communication is often less than dignifying. From the political podium to the digital medium to the boardroom table, the one who speaks in a spirit of respectful, unhyperbolic affirmation will always win more friends and influence more people to positive progress than the one who communicates in criticism, condemnation, and condescension. The beauty of this principle today is that our affirmation of others is not limited to tangible interface. “While nothing can replace the effectiveness of your face-to-face interactions,” explained TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie in a recent interview, “it’s important to remember that the digital world can enhance relationship building.”9 At any moment of our day we can spread messages that affirm our friends, fans, and followers in numerous ways over email, Twitter, text, and blogs. Don’t, however, make the mistake of separating the scalability of a message from the individual significance of the message. They are inextricably linked. As big as a business gets, as large a following as one accumulates, messages are still given and received on an individual level. What builds a bridge of influence between a king and his speech therapist is the same principle that builds a bridge of influence between a company and its customers or an executive and her reports or a father and his child. We are all united by one single desire: to be valued by another. Whether this message is conveyed is not a group decision. Each individual to whom a message was directed—whether the individual sits alone across a table or in a crowd of three thousand—determines it. In Carnegie’s original book he offered a story that has, perhaps more than any other story in its pages, struck a chord with millions of readers the world over. It was not his story. It belonged to a man named W. Livingston Larned, who called it “Father Forgets.” Carnegie included it as an encouragement to all of us who can so easily forget ourselves and spend days critiquing and criticizing others. It is included here with a different perspective—not of the father who finally sees his mistakes but of the young son who with an unconditional spirit of affirmation wields a level of influence that changes his father forever. Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside. These are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor. At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your shoulders back!” Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive—and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father! Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. “What is it you want?” I snapped. You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs. Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years. And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed! It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: “He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!” I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much. Isn’t it profound the influence one is afforded—even the smallest among us—when affirmation comes clean off our tongue and clear from our hearts? All great progress and problem solving with others begins when at least one party is willing to place what is already good on the table. From there it is much easier to know where to begin and how to lead the interaction to a mutually beneficial end.   3Connect with Core Desires In early 2002, Time put an odd-looking computer on its cover. It had a small, domed base and a jointed, shiny chrome neck affixed to a flat-screen monitor that enabled it to be pushed, pulled, turned, lowered or raised with the nudge of a finger. It was called the iMac, and the company introducing it, Apple Computer, desperately needed it to work in order to stay in business.1 Apple had always been the darling of a particular computing niche—generally creative, antiestablishment types. But in the article that accompanied the cover story, its CEO, Steve Jobs, enunciated a brand-new vision for consumers. He said he believed the future lay in the PC as the “digital hub” of camcorders, digital cameras, MP3 players, Palm PDAs, cell phones, and DVD players. He risked the company’s future on a vision of a place where an entire digital life could be consolidated. And so with the iMac came a free suite of software that today is synonymous with the digital age—iTunes, iPhoto, and iMovie. Critics and competitors mocked Jobs. Some of Apple’s longtime rivals called the computer “clownish” and “silly” and the vision “far too grand.” The public? They embraced the vision and the life that it promised. And Apple Computer, now simply Apple, has seen its share price increase 4,856 percent. The closest competitor has increased approximately 14 percent. Why? Is it because other computer companies would prefer no one buy their products? Of course not—they all want to be successful. They all want to be well liked. What they are after is more and more influence in the form of people consuming their products. The difference is that Steve Jobs recognized something Dale Carnegie championed repeatedly: to influence others to act, you must first connect to a core desire within them. This is a universal truth whether you are dealing with children or clients or calves. One day the famous philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son were trying to get a calf into the barn. It was going rather poorly. They pushed and the calf pulled. They pulled and the calf pushed. Meanwhile, their housemaid noticed their predicament, and though she couldn’t write brilliant essays or books, she possessed an insight she thought might solve the problem. She walked over to the calf and put her finger in its mouth. While the calf suckled, she gently led it into the barn. What did the maid know that the luminous philosopher had forgotten? She knew that one of the calf’s core desires was food. Once she tapped into that desire, the calf willingly followed. Emerson and his son merely thought about what they desired—the calf in the barn so they could eat their lunch. But the calf, happily grazing in a green pasture, had little interest in descending into a dark, confined barn that curtailed his dining options. That is, until the housemaid showed up, offered her finger, and reminded the calf that some warm milk was in his future. It is an excellent metaphor because it reminds us of two key insights we often overlook when trying to influence others. 1. Influence requires more intuition than intellect. The critical contrast between the luminary Emerson and his humble housemaid is not one of dissimilar brainpower. While Emerson was likely the more learned of the two, the divergence between them was one of intuition. The housemaid had what Emerson lacked. The public world tends to freely ascribe sway to those in lofty positions that require much education and aptitude—the CEO, department chair, physician, and billionaire. We assume such people can move majorities with a whisper and the snap of a finger. But as Guy Kawasaki, former chief evangelist at Apple, pointed out, “If such a person does not have a deep relationship with people, she won’t have much influence with them.”2 The truth is that such stately individuals possess merely above-average conditions to influence, while the way in which influence is won remains no different for them than for anyone else. Influence is no respecter of education or experience; it goes only with the one who will set aside his status—be it high and mighty or low and lowly—and put himself in the place of another. To do so takes a shrewd and spontaneous ability to read beneath the surface of an interaction. “What is essential,” wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, “is invisible to the eye.” This is an important truth to keep in mind when dealing with those you would like to win over. Influencing others is not a matter of outsmarting them. It is a matter of discerning what they truly want and offering it to them in a mutually beneficial package. “He knows so little and accomplishes so much,” Robert McFarlane, the third of President Reagan’s six national security advisors, once marveled of his boss. When Reagan “left Washington more popular than when he first took office,” writes Richard Norton Smith, he accomplished something that hadn’t been done since Dwight Eisenhower.3 How? According to President Obama, “Reagan recognized the American people’s hunger for accountability and change. . . . He tapped into what people were already feeling.”4 2. Influence requires a gentle hand. There were Emerson and his son in a four-handed, eight-legged tug-of-war with the obstinate calf who was holding his ground. It is no way to sway another to your side. Onto the scene, in great contrast, strides the housemaid with an index finger extended, straight and not hooked no less, and the once stubborn calf is suddenly light on its hooves and willingly wrapped around the housemaid’s pointer. Lest we forget, it is a memorable image of what little moving we have to do to move another to action. As a constant reminder, former U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower displayed a paperweight in the Oval Office that, in Latin, read: “Gently in manner, strong in deed.”5 There is no question of his global influence. “Action springs from what we fundamentally desire,” author Harry Overstreet writes in Influencing Human Behavior. “And the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”6 The practice of connecting with core desires is applicable across industry lines and international borders. It is as important for the energy executive from Holland as it is the executive producer in Hollywood. The interpersonal efforts that inevitably succeed are those in which the messenger stops dictating and starts discovering what the recipient wants. The interpersonal efforts that inevitably fail, be they corporate collaboration, personal cooperation, or artistic rendering, are those in which the messenger attempts to tell the recipient what he wants. This is perhaps no more evident than in the sales industry, an industry of which, in a semantic sense, we are all part. In his book Killing the Sale bestselling author Todd Duncan describes the ten fatal mistakes salespeople make. One of them he calls “arguing,” and when we fail to connect with another’s core needs we are just as guilty of it, whether or not we call selling our profession. The mistake of arguing . . . is staking your sales success on your ability to state your case in convincing fashion. It’s mastering a monologue and then expecting the jury of your prospects to be convinced to take your side. But . . . establishing an initial level of trust takes more than flowery monologue. It takes dialogue. It takes actual conversation. There is no other way for you to know your product or service will meet [a person’s] needs.7 He later cites Dr. Theodore Zeldin, author of Conversation, who makes the point succinctly: “Real conversation catches fire.”8 It is mind-boggling that despite the millions of branding and marketing dollars spent every year, much is still spent on the messengers’ wants or whimsies rather than the recipients’ core desires. We get an idea in our head for who we want to be or how we want others to perceive our offering, and we spend more time shaping and shining that image than we do ascertaining whether the image really matters to those to whom it must matter. Most individuals and organizations invest more resources in campaigning than in connecting. It should be the other way around. Consider the comparison chart Duncan offers juxtaposing what the two forms of interpersonal communication say about you:9   Dialogue Monologue   Considerate Conceited  Authentic Fake   Transparent Manipulative   Secure Needy   Interested in meeting needs Interested in making money   Builds trust Builds tensiona   Of course, connecting to people’s core desires does not mean the world will be your oyster. Suffice it to say that without this approach, others will remain largely unapproachable. Their ears will close and their eyes will look elsewhere for something or someone more engaging. And their options are endless in the very world Steve Jobs saw in 2002. Fortunately, most corporate emails, company tweets, brand blog entries, and commercial ad campaigns are monologues meant to broadcast opinions, distinguish brands, launch products, and construct personas. It is precisely because this is so that the person who speaks in a spirit of dialogue and altruistic discovery nabs a significant advantage. How do you know if you hold this advantage? An honest inventory of your impact is usually enough. Have your employees really stepped it up, or do they remain in a cycle of fits and falters? You are confident your marriage is on the upswing, but what does your spouse have to say? You insist the customers are impressed by your new products; does your sales revenue concur? You say your brand is sweeping the nation, but against what standard are you measuring brand recognition? In The Seven Arts of Change, author David Shaner clarifies the difference between those who truly connect with core desires and those who are merely playing influence the way kids play doctor. He writes, Nearly every study of organizational change over the past two decades indicates that companies fail to make the change they intend approximately seventy percent of the time. . . . Before organizational change can succeed, it must first occur at the subtle spiritual level in the individuals of the organization. . . . All lasting transformation must begin there because, ultimately, your spirit and mine is the primary driver of all our behavior.10 True change is born of an interpersonal reach that takes hold of the deepest part of an individual. Shaner’s explanation is dead on, and he should know. His company, CONNECT Consulting, has for thirty years helped multinational corporations such as Duracell, Ryobi, MARC USA, and SVP Worldwide lead successful company change efforts. His words remind us that no companywide campaign or individual communication strategy garners influence until it connects with people at their core. It is an essential principle in all your efforts to influence others, whether your audience is a five-year-old child or five thousand employees. A former U.S. secretary of education once recounted how he didn’t learn this essential element of engagement until after his first year on the job. He felt pretty good about his progress. He’d ventured out and given speeches, and people had applauded and smiled. He’d attended many dinner parties and sumptuous gatherings, and all seemed to go off without a hitch. But to what end? While home over Christmas with time to reflect, he came to acknowledge that while he’d been highly visible and highly promissory, nothing in the department had really changed. Five thousand employees showed up on time. They completed their assigned work. They went home. There was movement, but few if any were moved, inside or outside the office walls. He wanted to understand why. Over the first two months of the following year he spent a lot of time with the people who really ran the Department of Education—the career civil service workers who pressed forward no matter which political party filled the White House. He came to the sobering realization that while he stood on the bridge, turning the wheel, the wheel wasn’t connected to anything below. And since he had no authority to hire or fire from the civil service ranks, the only way he could influence positive progress in the department was by winning them over. The problem was, they’d seen politicians come and go. They’d grown tired and cynical. They’d given up on deriving inspiration from the top. The secretary’s wife suggested the way to win them over was by reminding them he was passionate about education, and to do so not with new words but with new actions. “Go to schools, spend time with kids. Do retail. Everyone will notice because these are the things they really care about.” “I don’t do retail,” he huffed. “I’m the secretary of education. I do wholesale.” His wife, the daughter of a salesman, smiled. “Darling,” she said, “if you can’t do retail, you’ll never do wholesale.” She was right, and the secretary knew it. For the next year he toured the country, rolled up his sleeves, read stories, listened to teachers, and was reminded how much he loved retail education. It was a personal victory. More significant, however, was the effect his actions had on his employees. Their passion was revived—passion for their daily tasks, for better education, for more opportunities for more families. They were inspired by the secretary’s work because his actions had accomplished something the speeches and sumptuous gatherings had not. They had tapped a core desire of the tireless Department of Education workers: purpose. They wanted to believe again. They just needed to be reminded that their work still mattered. The secretary offered this reminder, and it dramatically turned the tide.11 In our rushed world, it is easy to forgo the secretary’s level of analysis. So much of our digital communication is one-way that we come to believe we have limited opportunity to uncover another’s perspective. While we communicate with more and more people every day, we also become more insular in our approach. We are far more inclined to focus on how we can best broadcast our points from our own perspective, quickly, broadly, or both. Isn’t this what we witness all around us? It is easy to get so caught up in the fray that we forget what we are aiming for: connection, influence, agreement, collaboration. We can start to believe the battle is won by mere frequency and occasional originality—useful strategies in the right context, but greatly insufficient as your only influence strategies. There is a good side, however, to this constant barrage of onesided broadcasting, which spans the spectrum from corporate posturing to celebrity positioning. Today, with a few keystrokes, we can better educate ourselves about other people’s perspectives and goals. Earlier we discussed the dangers of using your digital space to spout off your complaints. Most of us are more discerning about what we divulge. We reveal what matters to us, what we think about often, what we love and like and hope to see happen soon. These tidbytes of information add up to a body of knowledge that offers clues or even clear windows to our core desires. This knowledge is invaluable where influence in concerned because, like the calf that just wanted more food, we only move toward what moves us.   Part 2Six Ways to Make a Lasting Impression   1Take Interest in Others’ Interests When it comes to learning the quickest way to win friends, shall we turn to the person with the most followers on Twitter, the blogger with the most Diggs, the savviest salesperson, or the most powerful politician? While each can boast of abundant followership, and while each will likely offer good advice, such people might not be our best role models. In fact, our best role models might not be people at all. Perhaps dogs are. Whether we’ve stepped outside for two minutes or traveled for two weeks, dogs welcome our return as if we were heroes. They never demean us or mock us or stand us up for dates. They exist to befriend us, to orbit around us as the center of their existence. Are they ever without pure joy just being in our presence? Dogs are called man’s best friend for a reason. Stories of canine loyalty are the stuff of legend. The great poet Byron wrote of his dog Boatswain, “He had all the virtues of man and none of his vices.”1 These are also the stories of our day. Jon Katz’s A Dog Year and John Grogan’s Marley & Me were nothing if not love stories written by men grieved by their dogs’ passing. Dogs know by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in minutes by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in months of trying to get other people interested in you. It is more than a furry, four-legged platitude. It is a primary principle without which no person can gain real relational traction with another. The great irony of human relations—especially when viewed through the lens of a canine—is that our longing for significance in the lives of others should be so simple to meet, yet we complicate the matter; our biggest struggle is selfishness, the single greatest deterrent to amity. That we are interested primarily in ourselves is not a phenomenon as new as Twitter or Facebook. It predates Friendster and MySpace. It came before cell phones and email and the Internet. In the 1930s, when Carnegie was penning the original manuscript of this book, the New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out which word was the most frequently used. The personal pronoun “I” was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. Our selfishness, or more politely our self-interest, populates the morals of the great fables. Icarus swoops and soars into the sun’s warmth, melting the wax on his wings, sending him plummeting to the ocean below because he’s thinking only of himself, ignoring the pleas of his father. Peter Rabbit incurs Mr. McGregor’s wrath by ignoring his mother’s commands to stay out of his garden. Why did Adam and Eve disobey God in the Garden of Eden? They were thinking only of themselves. This self-interest isn’t something anyone is likely to change. It is a gravitylike reality. We are born with innate fight-or-flight tendencies. That is to say, our body of words and actions trends toward self-preservation. Yet we often forget to consider whom we are really fighting against and to what destination we are fleeing. If we are not mindful, our self-defense can turn into self-detention, keeping us from meaningful interaction and in some cases cutting us off from interpersonal progress altogether. If we are not mindful, the destination to which we flee can become a lonely, isolated isle. Like the city of Troy whose walls of great defense became the source of its great demise, we can insulate ourselves to the point of interpersonal futility. “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men,” wrote Alfred Adler, the famous Austrian psychotherapist, “who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring.” That’s quite an audacious statement. But it is a statement borne out in fact. Humanity’s greatest failures, from the killing fields of Cambodia to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, are the result of people interested only in themselves, damn the collateral damage. These are extreme examples, but the everyday versions are just as disturbing. The general counsel busted for taking a bribe never thought of the shareholders who were counting on that stock for their retirement. The pro athlete who took performance-enhancing drugs never considered how his actions would affect his teammates, his team’s future, or the sport he claims to love. The husband and father caught in his lie was more interested in preserving a double life than protecting his family’s hearts. Still, self-preservation’s downfall is about more than catastrophes. Look back at the quote “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life.” Adler is simply explaining that a self-centered life is the most problematic life one can live. A life lived in constant interpersonal struggle. Few true friends. Shallow, short-lived influence. This can seem a foreboding principle to embody in an age in which we are rewarded for brooding over and broadcasting our interests far and wide. But the ancient maxim is still true: “For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”2 Our effectiveness with others is ultimately a matter of motive and merchandise. Why, in the end, are you communicating and what, in the end, are you promoting? Today people are more informed and subsequently more intuitive than ever. Most of us immediately see through a person whose messaging is only for personal benefit. We see gimmicks a mile away. We run from underhanded approaches. Instead, we gravitate to what feels real and lasting. We embrace those whose messaging offers mutual benefit.3 Andrew Sullivan, one of the world’s top political bloggers, has considered such matters for more than a decade. Once the youngest-ever editor in chief of the venerable New Republic, Sullivan was diagnosed HIV-positive in the early 1990s, when it was still a death sentence. After leaving that post, Sullivan became one of the Internet’s first big political bloggers, with his site hitting more than 300,000 unique visitors per month in 2003. One of the things that set Sullivan apart from his peers was an intentional interaction with his readership. He wanted his blog, The Daily Dish, to be about more than politics; he wanted loyal readers, and he genuinely wanted to know more about the people who followed him. He came up with the idea for “View from Your Window,” in which he asked his readers to submit shots of the world outside their homes. As with most things on the Internet, he had no idea if it would hit. “I wanted to see their worlds,” he explained, “I was giving all of these people all of this access to mine, but oneway interactions are ultimately boring.”4 It was no small gesture, and it soon boosted his relationships with readers. After the gregarious feature was introduced, Sullivan’s work became the centerpiece for the Atlantic Monthly’s online strategy, and that site’s traffic increased by 30 percent. It is no surprise that Sullivan’s robust blog following remained when he moved his blog to Newsweek and The Daily Beast. People are attracted to people who care about what interests them. The irony of this principle—take interest in others’ interests—is that its effectiveness is predicated on others thinking of themselves. Its effectiveness essentially requires others being self-interested. There are two things to say about this. First, self-interest in its purest form is part of human nature—fight or flight is fact. This principle does not deny self-interest’s existence in all our lives. Instead it indicates that most people, on most days, forget the other side of the human equation—everyone else. Most take self-interest to the self-centered end of the spectrum. The effectiveness of this principle is therefore tied directly to the infrequency with which most choose to think outside themselves on most days. The one who chooses, conversely, to take interest in other’s interests on a daily basis is set apart. We remember such people, befriend them, and come to trust them more deeply. Influence is ultimately an outcropping of trust—the higher the trust, the greater the influence. Second, the pinnacle of this principle is not complete self-denial. Notice the principle does not read, “Replace your interests with others’ interests.” It instead reads, “Take interest in others’ interests,” and that is the secret to its application. When you incorporate others’ interests into your own—not merely for the sake of clarifying your market or ascertaining your audience—you find that your interests are met in the process of helping others. Consider bestselling author Anne Rice, who has sold more than 110 million books in her lifetime. Her career began and achieved sustained success with her famed vampire books, including Interview with a Vampire, which was made into a major motion picture. While she is a uniquely gifted writer, no small part of her success has been her genuine interest in her readers. She responds to every bit of her readers’ mail. This meant, at one time, employing three people full-time to meet the demand. Her interest in others has never been feigned for the sake of book sales. “It seemed to me,” she explains, “that people were kind and generous enough to have an interest in me. How could I not respond? I wanted people to know that I appreciated their letters and I appreciated them.”5 Rice has recently taken to Facebook and Twitter, giving her more direct contact with her fans. “Oh, it’s so wonderful,” she said. “We’re having a conversation about oh so many things.”6 She calls the community “People of the Page” and wrote recently, “I think we must remember that Facebook, and the Internet, are what we make of them. This page has accomplished something extraordinary and perhaps unique. It is truly a community, infinitely more powerful than the sum of its parts, and I thank you for making it what it is: for participating here in so many vital and inspiring discussions.”7 This result is as important for the owner of a business as it is for authors and bloggers. In his cult favorite treatise, Bass-Ackward Business, business owner Steve Beecham summarily admits, I have never considered myself a brilliant businessman. . . . The country was experiencing one of the great refinance booms of all time and . . . I jumped in with both feet. Unfortunately, the refinance well dried up before my feet got wet. I went six months without a deal and when I did finally close one it was for my brother’s home. . . . Instead of starting over, I set out to find a way to make the business work. This is when my fate started to turn.8 Beecham had already failed in two previous business ventures—a retail store and a recycling enterprise—prior to his attempt in the mortgage business. He had every reason to pack it up and head back to school or consider letting someone else hold the reins. He resisted long enough to see that his approach was wrong from the beginning. He was after business when he should have been after relationships. He goes on to describe an unexpected encounter in a parking lot with a selfless celebrity that taught him the visceral value of taking interest in others’ interests: Before I could get another word in, he started asking me questions . . . Where’d you grow up? What do you do for a living? What high school did you go to? What are your kids’ names? I left the encounter feeling ten feet tall. . . . In a subtle and unassuming way, he’d elevated himself in my mind. The encounter taught Beecham an invaluable lesson. From that day forward, he committed to asking thoughtful questions of every new person he met and every acquaintance he didn’t know very well. “Specifically,” he explains, “I decided to become a problem solver and a promoter . . . with no strings attached. This is when my business began to not only turn around; it began to take off.” In a matter of months Beecham’s job turned into a lucrative career, and soon he became so successful he owned a mortgage company that has since its inception remained at the top of the industry. Perhaps more significant is that his business has been 100 percent referral-based for a decade. He estimates that each day one-quarter of the calls his office receives have nothing to do with obtaining a mortgage—something he’s very proud of. They are people calling with questions like “Where should I get my car repaired?” “Where should I take my in-laws to dinner?” and “Whom should I call for life insurance?” He explains that these people call him because he’s become known as the go-to guy in a large local network of friends. “I didn’t get that way by holding free mortgage seminars or erecting a large billboard featuring my confident, trustworthy face,” quips Beecham. “I got that way by helping people without hustling them for business. It is why Thoreau wrote, ‘Goodness is the only investment that never fails.’”9 The same spirit of relating is within reach of every one of us in every interaction. How simple it is to set out motivated only to get to know others and find a problem you can help solve or a pursuit you can help promote. This is the simple secret to what Beecham calls bass-ackward business. Yet the truth is that the typical ways most conduct themselves in business relationships is what’s backward. “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine”—this isn’t reciprocity, it’s bartering, an entirely different trajectory that removes the magic. And it’s unadulterated magic that makes interactions so memorable. It’s what draws us in. There is trust and a genuine sense of belonging and meaning. Today there is simply no excuse not to take an interest in others’ interests. Even if you are not actively involved in clubs, groups, or local organizations where face-to-face interactions are possible, there is still an abundance of opportunities to learn about others’ passions and concerns. What could happen if you spent five minutes every day reading through the Facebook page of three friends, the professional biographies of three clients, or the personal blogs of three employees you haven’t taken the time to know well? For starters, you’d certainly learn something about them you didn’t know before. It’s also likely you would come to appreciate them more. Perhaps you have similar interests; this is fodder for future conversation, even for future collaboration. Perhaps one is going through a difficult time; this is an opportunity to engage them with encouragement and a greater level of empathy. Perhaps you have a mutual friend; wouldn’t this make your relationship much easier, as trust is already established in a common friend and time is already invested in common experiences? One can never underestimate the importance of affinity. “We tend to dislike what we don’t know,” blogged Amy Martin, founder of social media powerhouse Digital Royalty and one of Forbes magazine’s “20 Best-Branded Women on Twitter,” after her first experience with NASCAR.10 “Many people don’t understand, or better yet ‘get’ . . . the so-called monotonous day of left turns and mullets.” She was admittedly in that camp before attending the 2011 Daytona 500. Shortly thereafter she wrote a blog post singing NASCAR’s praises for achieving a level of genuine connection and influence with its fan base that is rare in professional sports. “Here’s what I learned,” she writes. “Drivers do fan Q&As and autograph sessions the day of the race. The Daytona 500 happens to be the biggest day of the year for NASCAR. I don’t think Brett Favre was chatting it up with thousands of fans the day of the Super Bowl. I received a magical ‘hot pass’ and could go anywhere. It was uncomfortably exciting having unlimited access and at times I worried about getting in the crew’s way. I was a part of the action and wasn’t the only one. Bottom line, fans have access.” As for why Martin believes NASCAR’s approach is a smart move for any sport, she cites the following reasons: • Access leads to connection. (Fans are able to sign the actual racetrack.) • Connection leads to relationships. (At all ages.) • Relationships lead to affinity. (You can’t fake this affinity.) • Affinity leads to influence. (There’s a reason so many brands are attracted to NASCAR.) • Influence leads to conversion. (These fans would likely buy anything this driver is selling.) Martin ends her post with a nod to the potential reach of NASCAR’s genuine connectivity with its fan base—150,000 fans in the stands and 30 million television viewers—were they to embrace the opportunities the digital age affords them. “There is huge potential,” she writes, “when you apply this same access via social media to a larger audience. What if the same behind-the-scenes access available to fans physically at the Daytona 500 was available to those billions of potential fans [on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube] who are not watching the race on TV?”11 Martin’s post bridges the two key points of taking interest in others’ interests today: 1. Human relations are always easier when they begin from a place of affinity. 2. The potential for relational connectivity is astronomical. The bottom line is that you must become genuinely interested in others before you can ever expect anyone to be interested in you. “All things being equal,” said author John Maxwell in a recent interview, “people do business with people they like. All things not being equal, they still do.” We like people who like us. So to be liked, you must exhibit admiration for the things others do and say. Many have argued that people no longer have much interest in others. The “me” focus dominates how we think, act, and communicate. Yet you have so many opportunities to stay connected, to learn more, to show your interest. Changing how you spend just a small portion of each day can dramatically change how others perceive your level of interest in them. Changing your customer engagement strategy can dramatically change how the marketplace perceives your company. Instead of spending each day refining your digital media, spend time relating to your friends, colleagues, and clients. Post brief, admiring notes. Interact with them and discover what problems you might help solve or what pursuits you might help promote; we are all driven by pain and pleasure, so such prospects exist in every person. When you are sincere in your endeavors to connect with others, chances are always higher that meaningful connection will occur. Progressive, mutually beneficial collaboration is then possible. And today, genuine connection and collaboration can quickly become infectious.   2Smile Getting people to agree about virtually anything is practically impossible. Take Neil Armstrong’s 1969 romp across the moon. In the United Kingdom only 75 percent of people believe it actually happened.1 Only 94 percent of Americans believe it happened.2 In countries such as Mexico, China, and Indonesia, fewer than a third of respondents believe al Qaeda had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. In the United States 16 percent of people believe it was planted explosives rather than burning passenger jets that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center.3 About half of citizens in the European Union believe in God.4 There is one thing that does unite us, however. According to the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, 99.7 percent of adults believe a smile is an important social asset.5 It’s a difficult statistic to refute, even if you aren’t in the business of perfecting smiles. We gravitate to grins and giggles. Consider the all-time most viewed videos on YouTube. The top two are all about smiles. In the most viewed, from the United Kingdom, Harry, a three-year-old boy, and his one-year-old brother, Charlie, are playing for the camera when Charlie grabs one of Harry’s fingers and shoves it in his mouth. A moment later he chomps down and Harry yelps in displeasure, retrieving his finger. All the while, Charlie smiles. That smile eventually wins as Harry’s smile returns and giggles ensue.6 The other video is from Sweden. In it a baby boy smiles, giggles, and laughs in response to his parents’ silly sounds. It is nearly two minutes of face-cramp-inducing smiles.7 A combined half a billion views tell us all we need to know. Smiles send a message we like to receive. Smiling is innate, says Daniel McNeill, author of The Face: A Natural History. Some sort of smile, he writes, first appears two to twelve hours after birth. No one knows whether these smiles have any content—McNeill suspects they do not—but studies show they are crucial to bonding. What no one can debate, however, is the power of a smile no matter its origin. McNeill notes that while “courtroom judges are equally likely to find smilers and nonsmilers guilty, they give smilers lighter penalties, a phenomenon called the ‘smile-leniency effect.’”8 Smiles also have a proliferation effect. Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Harvard, and James Fowler, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, with special expertise in social networks, published a paper in the British Medical Journal in 2008, entitled “Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network.” They knew emotions could spread over short periods of time from person to person, in a process known as “emotional contagion.” But what they wanted to know was just how widely and sustainably happiness spread in social networks. They followed 4,739 people from 1983 to 2003. These individuals were embedded in a larger network of 12,067 people, each having an average of eleven connections to others (including friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors), and their happiness was assessed every few years using a standard measure. The researchers’ findings confirmed the impact of a happy person, which smiling conveys directly. Social networks, they concluded, have clusters of happy and unhappy people within them that reach out to three degrees of separation. A person’s happiness is related to the happiness of their friends, their friends’ friends, and their friends’ friends’ friends—that is, to people well beyond their social horizon. We found that happy people tend to be located in the center of their social networks and to be located in large clusters of other happy people. And we found that each additional happy friend increases a person’s probability of being happy by about 9%. For comparison, having an extra $5,000 in income (in 1984 dollars) increased the probability of being happy by about 2%. Happiness, in short, is not merely a function of personal experience, but also is a property of groups.9 But what of life since 2003? Do our more prominent and ever-present digital walls filter out emotions rather than encourage them? Can happiness still spread in a world of bits and bytes? The answer, they found, is yes—if we can see that people are smiling. Christakis and Fowler followed up their first study by looking at a group of 1,700 college students interconnected by Facebook. They reviewed their online profiles, determined their closest friends, and this time studied everyone’s photographs, noting those who were smiling in the photos and those who were not. They then mapped the pictures based on who was smiling and who was not. Each student was represented by a node and each line between two nodes indicated that the connected individuals were tagged in a photo together. Students who are smiling (and surrounded by smiling people in their network) were colored yellow. Students who were frowning (and surrounded by the same countenance) were colored blue. And finally, green nodes indicated a mix of smiling and non-smiling friends. The map showed in vivid fashion how strongly the yellow nodes (smilers) and blue nodes (frowners) clustered together, with the yellow clusters proving to be much larger and more populated than the blues. Additionally, the nonsmilers seemed to be “located more peripherally in the network,” primarily on the outskirts of the map. This came as no surprise to Christakis and Fowler, who noted, Statistical analysis of the network shows that people who smile tend to have more friends (smiling gets you an average of one extra friend, which is pretty good considering that people only have about six close friends). Not only that, but the statistical analyses confirm that those who smile are measurably more central to the network compared to those who do not smile. That is, if you smile, you are less likely to be on the periphery of the online world. In their final thoughts after noting the large and frequent number of node clusters surrounding smiling people, and the remote and peripherally peppered nodes of frowning people, they wrote, “It thus seems to be the case, online as well as offline, that when you smile, the world smiles with you.”10 There is a simple reason for this phenomenon: when we smile, we are letting people know we are happy to be with them, happy to meet them, happy to be interacting with them. They in turn feel happier to be dealing with us. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl, or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through the clouds. Your smile is often the first messenger of your goodwill. Of course we don’t always feel like smiling, but if we make the effort, we not only make those around us happier but also become happier ourselves. You may not be a particularly exuberant, outgoing person, but a simple smile takes little effort—and the rewards can be astonishing. For the past decade, as email and texting have supplanted oral communication, we’ve been seduced by the fallacious notion that we live in an emotional desert. Entrepreneurs, business owners, and many professionals can carry on business with only a minimum of tactile interaction. Many modern two-dimensional media allow all of us at one time or another to forget about the importance of a smile. In many ways texts and emails of today are like the telegraph messages of old, which had their own share of troubles. A reporter once telegraphed actor Cary Grant about his age. “HOW OLD CARY GRANT?” the message read. The actor replied, “OLD CARY GRANT FINE. HOW YOU?” Clearly the human proclivity toward misunderstanding is high. Throw in technology and it becomes all the more inevitable. Where telegrams were once ubiquitous, today’s technology can be suffocating. In 1929, at the telegram’s peak, 200 million of them were sent. By April 2010 nearly 300 billion email messages were sent every day.11 Pile on a daily worldwide barrage of text messages, instant messages, and Facebook wall posts, and it is a small wonder the world hasn’t descended into anarchy. Thank goodness for smiles, which can do a better job of clarifying our messages than anything—even if they take the form of traditional emoticons, little faces composed of ordinary keyboard characters designed to give much-needed context for our communications. Recognizing the limitations of these symbols, the three largest Japanese cell phone companies—NTT DoCoMo, au, and Soft-Bank Mobile—created emojis, color pictures displaying a broad range of emotions and symbols to better emulate the face-to-face experience. Google has now adopted them for its email platform, and they are being rapidly integrated into iPhones. Yet while these clever little symbols are endearing, they are unlikely to appear within your next digital message to a board member, a problem employee, or a prospective client. Emoticons are largely for use in casual conversations, and in such contexts they serve well. How, then, do we smile across all media and, when necessary, maintain a certain level of professionalism in the process? There is little doubt that letting another see your smile is most effective, but because so many of our interactions today are not face-to-face, you must turn your resources toward overcoming the obstacles to exhibiting friendliness across digital space. It may be simpler than you think. Outside of emoticons and emojis, there is only one medium in which you can convey a digital smile—your voice, whether it is written or spoken. How you write an email, the tone you use, and the words you choose are critical tools of friendliness and subsequent influence. Your written words are like the corners of your mouth: they turn up, they remain straight, or they turn down. The subsequent effect—whether the words garner friendships and influence—has much to do with the linear trajectory of the emotion they convey. Smile through your written words and you convey to others that their well-being is important to you. You and your message will have the best chance of being received. Frown through your words and others will often frown on the message and messenger. These conclusions certainly do not account for those occasions when a more serious tone ought to be taken. Still, a good rule of thumb here is to make sure the linear thread of the message trends upward. Always begin and end the message on a positive note rather than on a pessimistic or detached one. Between two people there is nearly always a reason to smile. If you can’t see a reason, then perhaps you need to wait before you write or not write at all. As many relationships have been damaged by insensitive, knee-jerk notes as by verbal insults or tirades. The reason is simple: Written words and their effect are permanent and largely irrefutable. While you might argue against your email’s negative or tactless tone, the echoing effect it has on its recipient is nearly impossible to silence. And today that effect can multiply quickly, damaging relations between employees, departments, and even entire value chains. According to a recent issue of Fast Company, “New research is adding a Twittery flavor to the old adage ‘birds of a feather flock together,’ because it suggests happy twitterers tend to aggregate.” The article goes on to explain, “Above many other factors that cause people to aggregate together, people who are sad or happy tend to communicate on Twitter with other people who are sad, or happy.” The research team, including University of Indiana professor Johan Bollen, analyzed the tweet streams from 102,000 Twitter users over six months, examining 129 million tweets. The analysis used standard algorithms borrowed from psychological research to assess the “subjective well-being” of users from their tweets by looking for trends in positive or negative words. Then they looked at aggregation trends, and found that happier people are more usually found re-tweeting and messaging other Twitter users who are also happy. The same is true for unhappy people. From the findings, Bollen suggests a tweet is more infectious than we realize, “and very effectively communicates joy or sadness. People who are happy would then tend to prefer (on average) happier fellow tweeters because they echo their own emotions.”12 The fact remains—if you can’t convey the proper amount of positive emotion in a written note, you are better off leaving the page blank, or perhaps even inserting an emoji (to the detriment of your professional reputation). There are worse things, in other words, than being thought a bit unprofessional. Avoiding negative sentiment with your written words altogether is obviously the goal. It is largely possible. Perhaps it is time to rethink the value of those writing skills your teachers insisted would be necessary one day. They were right, after all. The other way in which you convey your digital voice, your spoken words, has heavy implications as well. How you speak, the tone in your voice, and the words you choose often express more than the words themselves. You have no doubt heard the retort: “Your actions speak so loudly I can hardly hear a word you are saying.” It is just as true to assert: “Your tone speaks so loudly I can hardly hear a word you are saying.” Asserting you are glad to meet someone on a phone call means little if said with minimal facial movement and no positive inflection. It simply comes across that you are bored or busy with something more important, or worse, the complete opposite message—that meeting the person is an unpleasant proposition. Avoiding such situations begins in the same way it would begin if you were standing in front of the person. Numerous studies have shown that the physical act of smiling, even while on a phone call, actually improves the tone in which your words are conveyed. It is no coincidence that one of the central tenets that all speaking, singing, and broadcasting coaches drill into their students is that your voice sounds more pleasant, more inviting, and more compelling when you are smiling. A smile, in other words, translates across wires whether or not the person on the receiving end can see your face. When seeking influence that leads to positive change, there is no sidestepping the door of healthy human relations. A smile opens this door whether it’s visible, written, or verbal. Rosalind Picard is a professor at the MIT Media Lab and internationally known for her book Affective Computing, about giving technology emotional qualities that help people communicate more effectively. The advances she highlights are nothing short of staggering—machines with “faces” that can respond appropriately to reprimands or praise, encouragement or rebuke.13 Of course, these machines are merely responding to preprogrammed commands, much as a computer screen responds when a key is pushed. These machines mimic physical cues, words, and verbal tone, yet they do not feel. It is worth noting that humans can program such technology. This fact alone provides compelling evidence of how well we know pat responses to others’ cues, words, and tone. We are wired in the same way we wire our technologies, only with feeling to boot. “There are two kinds of people,” blogged media maven Chris Brogan, those who see the computer/internet/buttons as being attached to human, feeling beings, and those who think it’s just online and that it doesn’t attach. That’s like saying the phone is just something to talk into and there’s no emotions there, either. It’s not just online. People do have feelings that they associate to these “at a distance” places. Yes, people overreact. We agree there. But to dismiss emotions simply because of the medium would be to dismiss letters, telephones, pictures, etc. Lots of things happen at a distance and yet convey consequences. I think there are most definitely two sets of minds at work, and that by realizing the above, it describes/defines a lot of those times when one side or the other feels misunderstood. Just remembering this one detail, and realizing which of the two people you’re dealing with [and which one others perceive you to be], and things might get better.14 Emotions, it seems, are the boundless gifts (and burdens) that humans carry. This can either discourage or encourage. Your mouth has a lot to say about your choice. A smile, someone once said, costs nothing but gives much. It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever. None is so rich or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made rich by it. Yet a smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give you a smile. Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.15 Smile. It increases your face value.   3Reign with Names On March 10, 2010, a press release skittered through the wires at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges, one of American Lawyer’s top 100 law firms. John Quinn and Eric Emanuel, who founded the company twenty-five years earlier, were naming a new partner—Kathleen M. Sullivan. Sullivan, one of the nation’s top litigators and former dean of Stanford Law School, had been credentialed at Cornell, Harvard Law, and Oxford. She’d been First Lady Michelle Obama’s professor at Harvard, and praise for her legal mind, acumen, and talent was universal. Her adversaries knew how tough a legal foe she was. Her appointment was well deserved. Law firms, like all companies, make changes to their businesses from time to time. Associates come and go, paralegals and assistants as well. Partner turnover is much rarer, but it is hardly uncommon. Why was this particular appointment so significant? Kathleen Sullivan was not just named a partner; she became a named partner. The new firm would henceforth be called Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. To be a named partner in a law firm is especially significant, all the more at a prestigious firm. But what put Sullivan’s appointment into rare air was that she immediately became the first woman ever to be a named partner at one of America’s top 100 law firms. From 1870, when Ada H. Kepley became the first woman to graduate from a law school, to 2010, no other top firm had made space on its door for a woman’s name. But no more. A name was embraced and a barrier broken. Quinn wrote, “Her inclusion in the firm’s name reflects the integration of our trial and appellate practices and our strengths as a national law firm.” There is power in a person’s name. More than a word, it is a verbal symbol of something much deeper and more meaningful. This is not just the case for groundbreakers such as Kathleen Sullivan. From ancient to modern literature, a person’s name was not merely a moniker; it was a revelation of character, personality, and fate. Apollo, Abraham, and Atticus; Cosette, Scarlett, Cinderella, and Pollyanna. In Roman times, a name was so closely identified with who a person was that when a criminal’s name was removed from the civic register, all the rights of citizenship vanished. To this day certain tribes in Africa believe an individual’s given name is the primary force that determines his or her skills, decisions, and ultimately life’s destiny. Is there any reason to believe a person’s name is any less important today? It is perhaps more so, but it has become primarily the case in a commercial context. This represents opportunities and problems. In the digital age, names are like company logos, identifying not only who one is but also what one represents—likes and dislikes, yeas and nays. The hundreds of millions of bloggers, tweeters, and Facebookers surely want their voices heard, but they also want their names known. Twitter and Facebook in particular have done more than simply add to an information-based economy; they have also created a new kind of name-based economy in which we are largely known by the name we brand and campaign to the world. This sort of recognition can now be monetized, of course, giving new meaning to the phrase “household name.” On Twitter and blogs, your commercial worth is commensurate with the number of names following you. As your following grows, publishing contracts, advertising agreements, and endorsement deals increase not only in viability but also in value. Technorati Top 100 blogger Ree Drummond is a great example. A University of California, Los Angeles, graduate with big plans to practice law in a big city, she met and married her “Marlboro Man” husband while on a “pit stop” in Oklahoma, as she put it. Plans for law school in Chicago went out the window, and she moved to her husband’s fourth-generation cattle ranch and took on her new moniker, “Pioneer Woman.”1 Drummond began blogging in 2006 as a way to keep friends and family apprised of her unexpected but gratifying life. By 2009 she had approximately two million readers and site traffic in the eight-figure range monthly. By 2010 she had two lucrative book contracts and two subsequent New York Times bestsellers, and she was earning approximately $1 million a year from blog ad sales alone.2 It is clear that our own names can hold value today, but lest we be tempted to forget, knowing others’ names can lead to greater success. Dave Munson, founder of the Saddleback Leather Company, knows this well. He was a volunteer English teacher in Mexico when he had his first leather bag made from a design he drew for a local leatherworker. The bag garnered so much attention on his hometown streets of Portland, Oregon, he decided to return to Mexico immediately and have more made. A month later Munson returned to Portland with eight bags in tow and sold them all from the safari rack of his old Land Cruiser in three hours. The Saddleback Leather Company was born, and with it the goal “to love people around the world by making excessively high quality, tough and functional leather designs.”3 His secret? Munson frequently fields customer calls from his cell phone and returns online questions via phone or email; he also travels to Mexico multiple times each year to stay connected with the Mexican leatherworkers still making his bags. The visits aren’t showmanship. “I hug the workers and ask them how I can pray for them,” he explained in a recent interview. “When I first started taking the trips I remember how shocked these men were that I would call them by name and then sit down and talk to them about their personal lives. One got tears in his eyes. Then so did I.”4 He doesn’t share these personal stories on his blog or in his marketing literature because he believes promising to do something is different from simply producing it. Saddleback is proud, he says, to remain a family business despite selling millions of dollars’ worth of leather goods each year. “I’ve heard horror stories of lots of small and successful businesses who, driven by greed, try to become giants and fail,” Munson writes on his blog. “We aren’t like that. We are and will maintain our family of leather owners with love. Pretty much everyday I lay down in bed with my hot wife and we talk about different bag owners who we’ve been going back and forth with. We want to know your name.”5 It is this level of personal touch—putting people’s names before product names and profits—that makes one surmise Saddleback Leather will be around as long as one of his leather bags, which carries the tagline “They’ll fight over it when you’re dead.” The opportunities to be known by others and to know others are ultimately two sides of the same coin. There is branding—the introduction of you to others. And then there is relationship building—the interaction between you and others. What is interesting is that you can forgo the former and still be successful. You can be so good at building relationships that your interactions with others birth and sustain your brand. Conversely, you cannot sustain success on branding alone. You cannot brand yourself or your business and then forgo building relationships. In the end, business is still about one person relating to another. Mr. Bates from Watkinsville, Georgia, experienced this firsthand. He is a business owner who always takes his top out-of-town suppliers to Bone’s, a famous Atlanta restaurant some seventy miles away. His loyalty, however, wasn’t born of their exquisite menu, branded as well as any in North America. It started with a waiter named James. As Mr. Bates and a supplier pulled up to their table one evening, James approached promptly. “Hello, Mr. Bates,” he said. “Thank you for choosing Bone’s. It is a pleasure to have you back.” To hear Mr. Bates describe it, it was no insignificant moment. “It changed the dining experience and imprinted that restaurant in my mind. I’d only dined there once before—six months earlier—and James not only knew my name, he took the time to discover I’d been there before. I was by no means a regular, but the small gesture made me feel like one. It was the old adage about ‘treating someone like the person you want him to become’ coming true.” For such a small gesture it paid big dividends. “I don’t take my suppliers anywhere else now,” said Mr. Bates. Judging by the popularity of Bone’s, it would seem many customers share his sentiment. This is the primary business payoff of remembering people’s names: they remember you. The flipside is an unenviable place to be. One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget is oblivion.” It is one trait that unites most of history’s great leaders. From Lincoln to Churchill to Bonaparte, these men figured out ways to remember people’s names with surprising consistency. In so doing, they recalled, knowingly or not, a famous Emerson saying: “Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices.”6 When it comes to remembering names, some sacrifices may be required. Napoleon III, emperor of France and nephew of the great Napoleon Bonaparte, claimed he could remember the name of every person he met despite all of his royal duties. How? If he didn’t hear the name distinctly, he said, “So sorry. I didn’t get the name clearly.” Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, “How is it spelled?” During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name several times and tried to associate it in his mind with the person’s features, expression, and general appearance. If the person was of special importance to him, he later wrote the name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he gained a visual impression of the name as well as an audible impression.7 Our challenges today are far greater than Napoleon’s. Numerous studies show that the only thing worse than television for our attention span is the Internet. A blur of 140-word tweets, Facebook news feeds, emails, instant messages, and web pages are beginning to rewire our brains. In a May 2010 issue of Wired, author Nicholas Carr revealed that a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, had discovered that just five hours on the Internet rerouted people’s neural pathways. Carr noted: Dozens of studies by psychologists, neurobiologists, and educators point to the same conclusion: When we go online, we enter an environment that promotes cursory reading, hurried and distracted thinking, and superficial learning. Even as the Internet grants us easy access to vast amounts of information, it is turning us into shallower thinkers, literally changing the structure of our brain.8 In 2010 famed film critic Roger Ebert blogged, “There’s such a skitterish impatience in our society right now.”9 He’s right. But such reality doesn’t give us an excuse for forgetting people’s names. Instead, it provides us with a challenge. As more and more people find it more and more difficult to remember names, there is enormous advantage to be gained by those who do. How? There are some easy ways. Instead of defaulting to hollow, truncated greetings such as “Hey” or “Hi,” default to a greeting that uses the person’s name: “Dear Robin” or “Good morning, Robert.” When you do, practice Napoleon’s technique and visualize the person’s face. If you’ve taken the advice of earlier chapters and sought to take interest in the person’s interests, impress your mind with those as well. “Robert is married with three daughters and he likes reading Ernest Hemingway.” It’s a simple exercise that will not only help you greet Robert by name the next time you interact; it will also go a long way to helping you consistently view him outside a mere transactional context. A quick tip here: Before you use people’s names, make sure you know them in the right context. Today most people have more than one name to which they answer. Celebrated entrepreneur Richard Branson is “Richard” to many friends, but he is also “Mr. Branson” to many acquaintances and “Sir Richard” to many fellow Brits. While we are a far less formal society at large, using a person’s name out of context is a good way to get a relationship off on the wrong foot. Susan or Suzie? Ben or Benjamin? Jacqueline or Jackie? The best advice is to avoid guessing. Don’t call Richard “Richie,” “Rich” or “Dick” in an email unless he’s been introduced as such, he’s asked you to use that name, or he’s referred to himself with that name in a voice mail, text message, or email to you. If you’ve not been introduced and have never corresponded, do a little homework on what people in your same relational position are calling him. Don’t check to see what his Facebook or Twitter friends call him—at this point you’re not yet his friend and have not earned the right to call him a more casual name. Instead, review how he refers to himself on his website or blog. If there is an article written about him or in which he is referenced, use that name. We must remember that a person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and use it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it, and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage. While many choose the safer alternative and address a person with terms such as “man,” “ma’am,” and “sir,” you can place yourself in the same person’s better graces by taking the time to not only remember but also use his or her name. Many of the salutation pitfalls we fear are easily avoidable with a few minutes’ worth of research. Aren’t a few minutes of your time worth it if it means standing out from the crowd, if it means making a better impression than most people make on others? If you want others to remember and use your name, the small investment is necessary. People have names coming at them in all forms all day long—people’s names, company names, brand names, street names, and store names. What will set yours apart? Largely, the emotions people associate with your name. If you’re just another waiter in just another restaurant in Atlanta—a metropolitan area of more than five million people—you will be no more memorable than the numbers on your license plate or the color of your shirt. Your name will do little to trigger emotions that connect others to you. It is no coincidence that Mr. Bates easily remembered James’s name after only one encounter. He estimates he dines out about twelve times a month. When asked if he remembers other waiters’ names, he replied, “I barely remember my own some days.” We should always be aware of the magic contained in a person’s name and realize that this word is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing, and nobody else. It is a person’s trademark. After the gift of life, a person’s name is the first gift he or she received. When this word is used in conversation, the information we are discussing or the connection we are seeking takes on greater meaning. Perhaps a doctor’s office provides the best evidence. There is an ongoing debate in the medical world about how and when first names should be used. Does a first-name basis overpersonalize interactions that are best kept in a professional realm? Or would a first-name basis help in the process of health and healing and particularly in the process of discussing very difficult prognoses? It would seem that most doctors believe professionalism is important and first names are best kept at bay. Yet doctors’ offices are typically places where patients feel dehumanized. They are folders and cases, not faces and feelings. Their names are frequently mispronounced or mistaken altogether, only serving to highlight a potentially dangerous disconnection. One high-profile doctor decided to buck the trend.10 Dr. Howard Fine is the head of the neuro-oncology program at the National Institutes of Health. In that capacity he performs original research, oversees and distributes all of NIH’s funding, and is the hands-on doctor for as many brain cancer patients as want to see him—free of charge, since it is a government program. When patients arrive to see him for the first time, they are largely hopeless. They’ve seen the statistics on the Internet. They’ve heard horror stories. Dr. Fine views part of his job as restoring hope—responsible hope. How he handles names plays a leading role in this process. He estimates he’s seen more than twenty thousand patients over the years, and one of the ways he has chosen to interact is by introducing himself as “Howard Fine,” without the doctor designation. From there his patients are encouraged to call him by his first name. It takes the relationship to another level, whereby he is no longer a detached doctor trying to keep them from dying; he is a highly educated friend, wise confidant, and fierce advocate who will fight for their full recovery. He is not in the business of blowing smoke. Instead, he understands that because the sharing of facts is both important and poignant for his patients, the establishment of rapport is essential for their well-being. What brain tumor patients need more than a doctor is a trusted advisor who understands. This is achieved more naturally when the doctor puts himself on the same level of his patients, a fellow human with a strong desire to live. It would be easy for a prominent physician to find power in the “Dr.” moniker. But a big part of what makes Fine’s program the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health, according to one of the institute’s heads, is that he recognizes that first names are more powerful and purposeful than detached ranks or bestowed titles. It is why Carnegie insisted names are “the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”   4Listen Longer How do you get the job, land the client, increase your influence, and not lose $180 million in market capitalization? Listen. In March 2008 the members of a little-known indie band from Canada were on their way to Nebraska to for a weeklong tour. The first leg of their United Airlines flight landed in Chicago. As the guys began to deplane, they heard a woman behind them exclaim, “They’re throwing guitars out there!” They pressed their noses up against the windows to see for themselves. The woman was right; their guitars were being tossed and dropped and tossed again onto the luggage cart. One of those guitars, a $3,500 Taylor, belonged to the band’s lead singer, Dave Carroll, who immediately tried telling a flight attendant what was happening. On his website he explains she cut him off. “Don’t talk to me,” she said. “Talk to the lead agent outside.” He went outside, where another employee never took the time to listen to his complaint. A third employee dismissed him saying, “But hun, that’s why we make you sign the waiver.” He explained that he hadn’t signed a waiver and that no waiver would excuse what many people on the plane had seen. She told him to wait until Omaha to talk to someone.1 Not surprisingly, when he opened his guitar case he discovered it had been badly damaged. Thus began a yearlong odyssey in which Dave Carroll tried to get someone at United Airlines to listen. During those twelve months, every United employee Carroll spoke with told him what to do, but none bothered to listen to him. At one point they told him to bring the guitar to Chicago for inspection. He had long since returned to his home in Canada, some fifteen hundred miles away. In the meantime, Carroll had the guitar fixed for $1,200. He was a professional musician and needed the primary tool of the trade. But the sound wasn’t the same. He told United he would settle with them for the repair bill. His request fell on deaf ears. But a traveling songwriter always has two things: something to say and a means to say it. If United wouldn’t listen, perhaps his music audience would.2 Carroll sat down and wrote a song called “United Breaks Guitars,” and on July 6, 2009, he uploaded a video of it to YouTube. He hoped for a million views in the first year. People listened far more than he anticipated: two weeks after it premiered, the video had nearly four million views. Within days, The Times of London revealed, “the gathering thunderclouds of bad PR caused United Airlines’ stock price to suffer a mid-flight stall, and it plunged by 10%, costing shareholders $180 million. Which, incidentally, would have bought Carroll more than 51,000 replacement guitars.”3 The power of listening is the power to change hearts and minds. More consequentially, it is the power of giving people what they most desire—to be heard and understood. Seesmic founder Loïc Le Meur maintains that the very idea of online ad campaigns is passé. The key for any and every company is a “long-term engagement program” that facilitates listening to customers.4 Online ad campaigns have so much promise, though. They can deliver a demographic profile unlike any other medium. Your company wants a twenty-three-year-old female computer programmer who likes basket weaving? There’s almost certainly a site where she can be found. Such profiling has long been the dream of advertisers everywhere. How could this not work? It doesn’t work, Le Meur says, because generating impressions or exposure simply isn’t how the world works.5 Rather, it works through listening and building up trust. This process is a slow one, but one that will always bear fruit. During the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him to come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him. The old neighbor got to Washington as quickly as he could. Lincoln talked to him for hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing the slaves. He went over all the arguments for and against such a move, and then read letters and newspaper articles, some denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he was going to free them. After the long conversation, Lincoln shook hands with his old friend, said goodnight, and sent him back to Illinois without ever asking for his opinion. Lincoln had done all of the talking. But the talking seemed to clarify his mind. “He seemed to feel easier after that talk,” the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted a sympathetic, trusted listener to whom he could unburden himself. Ultimately it is what we all seek at one time or another. The question is whether you are discerning enough to be a burden lifter. When President Coolidge became vice president, Channing H. Cox succeeded him as governor of Massachusetts and came to Washington to call on his predecessor. Cox was impressed by the fact that Coolidge was able to see a long list of callers every day and yet finish his work at 5:00 p.m., while Cox found that he was often detained at his desk up to nine o’clock. “How come the difference?” he asked Coolidge. “You talk back,” said Coolidge.6 Listening’s power, like that of smiling, is strong. When you listen well you not only make an instant impression, you also build a solid bridge for lasting connection. Who can resist being around a person who suspends his thoughts in order to value yours? Few people in modern times have listened as well as Sigmund Freud. A man who once met him described his manner of listening: It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities, which I had never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of that piercing “soul penetrating gaze” business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary. You’ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.7 One might argue that people such as Freud, Lincoln, and others in an age gone by had it easier. Their world was smaller and certainly more controlled. There is some truth to this argument, but not anything that provides us an excuse. Yes, our age is broader and far more untamed, but we made it so. And it is therefore we who can make such traits work in our favor. Unfortunately, it seems many haven’t yet figured it out. While our circle of influence balloons well beyond our neighbors and work colleagues to encompass, primarily through Facebook, much of our relational history, such an expansive network that numbers in the hundreds if not the thousands seems to be overwhelming to most. While the number of people to whom we might listen has expanded, the number of people to whom we actually listen is diminishing. A recent study profiled in the American Sociological Review reveals that people are growing more socially isolated than they were even twenty years ago: Overall, the number of people Americans have in their closest circle of confidants has dropped from around three to about two. . . . Whereas nearly three-quarters of people in 1985 reported they had a friend in whom they could confide, only half in 2004 said they could count on such support. The number of people who said they counted a neighbor as a confidant dropped by more than half, from about 19 percent to about 8 percent.8 “We’re not saying people are completely isolated,” notes Lynn Smith-Lovin, a Duke University sociologist who helped conduct the study. “They may have 600 friends on Facebook . . . and e-mail 25 people a day, but they are not discussing matters that are personally important.”9 More so than when this book was first published in 1936, there is a crying need for people who will make the time to listen, for people who will resist the “skitterish impatience” so prevalent in our age and make people more important than progress. It is of course absurd to believe progress can be made without the fidelity of other people, but we usually don’t see this until other people let us know—with their eyes, with their silence, with their closed wallets. There are few new tips that can create a personal or corporate cache of better listening. But there is one principle that, if applied daily, can reconnect you with others on a lasting level: presence. A martyred spiritual ambassador once framed the principle this way: “Wherever you are, be all there.”10 John, an aspiring political writer, understood this principle far earlier in life than his peers. His claim is that he’s never given a bad job interview. For every interview, he’s received an offer. But what is perhaps most interesting is that there has rarely been anything on paper to suggest he was the best fit. “I have, more often than not,” he admits, “been an average prospect on paper.” To what, then, does he attribute his uncommon interview success rate? A counterintuitive perspective on interviews. He explains: Every interview is a chance to learn something new about people I’ve never met. Think about it; the environment is conducive to it. There’s already a natural give-and-take. In my interviews I’ve learned about everything from culinary tastes to dashed dreams to crazy hopes. People want to be listened to and they want people around who will listen. So I listen. And I’ve found that listening imparts a great deal of respect—more so than any planned speech ever could.11 So it turns out that listening also garners great respect. And John’s rare interview presence has translated into rare opportunities—he has served as both a CIA agent and a White House speechwriter. When asked for suggestions on embodying his level of presence with others, he says his personal goal is to ask fifteen questions per day. The most important five, he explains, are to your family or those in closest proximity to you. Sure, ask about their day. But go deeper. Ask what made them laugh. Or perhaps what made them cry. Ask them about a lesson they learned or a person they met whom they liked. The next five are for the people with whom you work on a regular basis. “The old truth that there are no bad questions may or may not be true in a brainstorming session. It is certainly true when done with sincerity in a conversation with another person. If you ask with respect and interest, you cannot go wrong.” Finally, he explains, the last five questions are for your digital space—Facebook, emails, Twitter, and blogs. “Read others’ posts and messages closely; comment or reply with questions, and do it for at least five different people every day. In addition to that, use your posts and updates to ask more questions of your friends and followers. You may be surprised at how many people respond.” These are lessons Bob Taylor of Taylor Guitars certainly takes to heart. When he heard that Dave Carroll’s Taylor guitar had been damaged by United Airlines, he called Carroll directly and offered him two guitars of his choice. Imagine what might have happened if someone, anyone, at United exercised an ear for how to make things right with David Carroll. If they had, chances are high they would not have had to issue the following statement when Carroll’s video went viral: This has struck a chord with us. We are in conversations with one another to make what happened right, and while we mutually agree that this should have been fixed much sooner, Dave Carroll’s excellent video provides United with a learning opportunity that we would like to use for training purposes to ensure all customers receive better service from us.12 It is often said that you live and learn, but perhaps an equally important lesson for us all is that if you listen and learn, you live more harmoniously.   5Discuss What Matters to Them At a dinner party, George Bernard Shaw sat next to a young man who proved to be a bore of historic proportions. After suffering through a seemingly interminable monologue, Shaw cut in to observe that between the two of them, they knew everything there was to know in the world. “How is that?” asked the young man. “Well,” said Shaw, “you seem to know everything except that you’re a bore. And I know that!”1 Not quite the impression the young man was aiming for. But it proves an important point: when it comes to mattering to others, you must discuss what matters to them. Assume all else will fall on deaf, or in this case dull, ears. This is an interesting principle to consider given the spirit in which the vast majority of people communicate today. Most messages are primarily meant to educate others about our lives or our products, to reveal compelling portions of ourselves we think others would be attracted to. While this appears to be an assertive strategy, it is actually a passive strategy in that it requires others to connect with us. Like a banner ad on a website waiting to be clicked, we offer up digital ads of our best selves, hoping others will be compelled to engage. The trouble is, that’s marketing monologue, not relational dialogue. It’s assumption, not assimilation. When assumption guides our efforts to befriend or influence others, the results end up on the wrong side of memorable. In 1810, U.S. general William Henry Harrison, then governor of the Indiana Territory, was negotiating with Tecumseh in order to try to prevent open hostilities. He ordered a chair to be brought for the Native American chief. The man who brought it said, “Your father, General Harrison, offers you a seat.” “My father!” Tecumseh exclaimed. “The sun is my father and the earth is my mother, and on her breast I will lie.” Ignoring the chair, he stretched himself out on the ground.2 Today’s biggest enemy of lasting influence is the sector of both personal and corporate musing that concerns itself with the art of creating impressions without consulting the science of need ascertainment. Not only is this method presumptuous, but it is a poor business tack. What the world needs more of—what Carnegie espoused seventy-five years ago—is bridge-building dialogue. This begins when you flip the modern spirits of marketing and social media on their heads and begin all interactions with a mind for what matters to the other person. This starts, as we have said, with listening. Once you know what matters to others through a practice of longer listening, you can then truly engage them by putting such matters at the forefront of your interactions. If you’re talking business, this process is about putting the customer back into customer relationship management—an endeavor that blogger Doc Searls once pointed out is more often about management than the customer.3 “Everyone is wrong about influence,” writes power blogger and business strategist Valeria Maltoni, “except your customers.” Think about that before you get into trouble for not delivering meaningful results. . . . True influence flows from drawing together people with shared interests. It’s a process of identifying areas of relevancy among your customers and prospects, community building and allowing others to amplify your influence as you meet their needs. . . . You’ll be chasing the popular kids (even those who demur) until the cows come home if you keep thinking that influence is about you. It’s not. And you don’t need the following of a celebrity to build something of significance.4 You are ultimately building a community when you initiate interactions with what matters to others. And a community is what really matters to you, whether you’re building a brick-and-mortar business, launching a new brand, or planning an important reunion. Sure, there is an initial connection, and you need to make it. But much of marketing and social media today is only about the connection point—gaining another follower, notching another fan, claiming another customer. Often forgotten is the long-term plan. Businesses call it a customer retention strategy, but it is best thought of as a lively, meaningful dialogue among a community of friends. If the foundation of all long-term success is the establishment of trust-based relationships, then the goal of all interactions should be to convey value as soon and as often as possible. There are common hurdles to overcome. Jason travels to Senegal’s most remote regions a few times a year. He first traveled with a nonprofit that led him there. He returns today because he still learns there. Recently one of the village elders pulled him aside on a 115-degree afternoon to ask him a most urgent question: How did people in North America live? Jason explained that most lived in individual houses somewhat akin to the huts in the village. Others lived in apartments stacked on top of and next to each other to form bigger buildings. “And all of these homes,” the elder inquired, “they have walls all around?” Yes, replied Jason. “But why?” “To keep themselves safe from bad weather and sometimes from bad people and to protect the things in their home and to give privacy.” “Oh, no, no, no,” the elder replied. “That is backward.” In their village, he explained, they had torn down the walls to keep themselves safe. “You see, too many things hide behind walls. If we tear down the walls for all to see, then we are all safer.” We live in a modern world, and in the modern world we put up walls. There are firewalls for our computers, mortar walls for our estates, and wood and wire fences for our farms and family yards. Then there is the great wall of diffuse social interaction. It can lead to a level of influence that exists outside relationship—an influence founded on followership but not friendship. Open Leadership author and social media maven Charlene Li warns about the danger of such fortified digital influence. In a recent interview she noted the biggest concern—a false sense of security. “There is a difference between a friend and a fan,” she explained. “Fans have a smaller sense of commitment, smaller levels of interest. There is a continuum of loyalty whereby fans stand at one end and friends at the other. Influence occurs across the continuum but it is more certain and lasting on the friends’ end.”5 The easiest way to prove Li’s point is to go online and try to buy a Facebook friend. It can’t be done. Companies galore will sell you Facebook fans, and they can assure you of lots of Twitter followers, but leave it to social media to shine a bright light on the great truth that no true friend can be bought. “When are we going to learn that millions of followers does not always equal influence?” blogged Canadian Mitch Joel, author of Six Pixels of Separation and one of the iMedia 25: Internet Marketing Leaders and Innovators. It’s a game (err . . . business) that worked well until the proper analytics and platforms were put in place. . . . [S]maller, stronger groups are where influence lies. . . . The brands that are winning “true influence” . . . are winning (as opposed to #winning) because they have people who are having real interactions with other real human beings (and those interactions are truly meaningful). . . . [I]t is much more practical/realistic for businesses to think about using these opportunities to connect and have a sincere engagement instead of trying to rack up their numbers.6 Newton Minow was the influential head of the Federal Communications Commission under President John F. Kennedy. He later went on to serve in various other prestigious public and private sector jobs. When asked what his secret was, he said that it all came down to his college major. He’d majored in semantics—the study of meaning. Semantics isn’t simply about words; it’s about the context in which those words are used. It’s about understanding. He once remarked that 99 percent of all conflicts are about the misunderstanding of words used in different contexts. His success, therefore, came from trying diligently to understand what someone meant.7 The endeavor is all the more significant today because when Mark Zuckerberg decided to call everyone on Facebook “friends” he made a semantic choice that is easily misunderstood. The human brain—to say nothing of the human heart—cannot process hundreds of friends. According to Oxford University professor of evolutionary anthropology Robin Dunbar, the size of our brain limits our ability to manage social circles to around 150 friends, regardless of our sociability. Dunbar has looked at Facebook and found it to be true online as well. “The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world.”8 But here it is important to introduce Dunbar to Minow, because Dunbar defines a friend as someone you care about and contact at least once a year. Distinctions must be made, for while we cannot have 150 intimate friends, we can have 150 influential relationships. Intimate friendships possess deep commitment and are based on great risk—first comes the risk of believing that we are people who matter enough, who are weighty enough, to influence others’ lives. If we do not understand the significance of our presence, we can never give anyone the present of our lives. But an equally great risk is that having intimate friends opens us up to being deeply hurt by those friends. Some people protect themselves from relational pain by having no intimate friends. Others do it by having so many shallow friends that a hurt inflicted by one is diffused by the mass. The bottom line is that relationship involves risk, and if we want to influence other people’s lives, we have to be comfortable accepting that risk. While the amount we give of ourselves varies based on the relational intimacy we are seeking, risk is always implicit in the process of moving people from curious followers to certain friends with whom you have influence that transcends transactional trends. Once you know what matters to others through a practice of listening, placing your matters in a holding pattern is the only way to truly engage others with a steady diet of what they care about. And as with most meaningful risks, the reward is commensurate. Subsequent influence is more potent, and there soon comes a time when what matters to you matters to them. Jamie Tworkowski understands. In 2002 a friend named Renee was using the same razor blade to line her cocaine and cut her arms. Depressed, alone, and surrounded by “friends” who were spiraling down with her, Renee was not long for this world. Jamie, an unassuming surfboard sales rep, stepped in and with a group of friends intervened in Renee’s world. Eschewing emotional risk, they tried to give her the gift of presence. They bought her coffee and cigarettes, they gave her music, they surrounded her with love. They wondered what it would be like if, instead of her cutting a self-loathing, four-letter moniker into her arm, they could write love on her arms. Jamie’s friendship with Renee led him to design some T-shirts to sell to support the cost of her recovery program. His friendship with the lead singer of a popular rock band led him to ask a favor of the front man: “Wear one of our T-shirts onstage.” The musician did. Nearly a decade later, Renee is clean and Jamie’s organization, To Write Love on Her Arms, sells nearly $3 million in T-shirts a year and invests that money in numerous recovery programs. More than 200,000 follow Jamie on Twitter and Facebook. But he knows most are curious fans and followers. A much smaller number are friends, such as Renee. He has some slight influence with those who follow him; yet it is shallower than the influence he has with his friends, and mostly fleeting. He accepts this and celebrates that there are others in the world also doing good things worthy of following. He has strong influence with his friends; this is the malleable setting in which he chooses to reside. It is this place—different for everyone—where you must reside, whether you’re a multinational corporation or an individual change agent. The distinction between your friends and your followers is an important one to consider when seeking to make a lasting impression on others. There are those in this world with whom you have earned significant influence; they are a gift and a responsibility. You should not only know who they are but also always know what matters to them. The gift is what they bring to you; value it. The responsibility is to lead your relationship somewhere meaningful to both of you—but at the very least, to them. “A brand’s ability to have its message put in front of millions of people begins and ends with that impression,” concludes Mitch Joel in his aforementioned blog post. We (as a public) seem to believe that the influence comes from the sheer volume of impressions and connections that we have in the marketplace. . . . It doesn’t. True influence comes from connecting to the individuals, nurturing those relationships, adding real value to the other [people]’s lives and doing anything and everything to serve them, so that when the time comes for you to make an ask, there is someone there to lend a hand. Worry less about how many people you are connected to and worry a whole lot more about who you are connected to, who they are and what you are doing to value and honor them.9 Perhaps what is most meaningful to you, after all, is being meaningful to others. One thing is certain: In an age when the mass of messages multiplies daily, only a small number really matter. To influence others, make sure yours are among them.   6Leave Others a Little Better “He called himself Mike,” began blogger and consummate Building Champions business coach Steve Scanlon as he relayed a story he loves to share. “My wife, Raffa, and I were staying a few blocks south of Central Park, and we’d hailed his cab to embark on an annual dining tradition in Little Italy. Our timing was terrible. It was Halloween, and the already crowded streets were twice full. As Mike chopped his way through midtown and lower Manhattan it was apparent our plans would need to change. He suggested Greenwich Village, and we agreed. A few minutes later he dropped us at a Village curb, recommended three restaurants, and then rolled back into the crawling mass. I thought it was the last we’d seen of him.”1 But, as Scanlon likes to say with a smile, Mike thought differently. As they enjoyed their meal, Scanlon reached for the front pocket of his pants. He patted here and there, and there and here. His phone was missing. He panicked as he suddenly remembered where it was. Resignation set in as he imagined the misery of canceling his account, losing valuable contact information, and buying a new phone. He dialed his number from his wife’s phone, expecting to hear his own recording. Instead, a gentle Indian accent answered. “Hulloo?” “Who’s this?” Scanlon snapped, brusquer than intended. “Thees is Mike,” the voice said. Scanlon took a breath and fumbled through an explanation that ended with them needing to catch a flight home very soon. “My goodness,” Mike replied, “your phone is very important. I will come as quickly as I can.” He then coordinated a street corner meeting and promised to hurry. Scanlon turned to his wife in amazement and relief and explained what was happening. When Mike pulled to the curb twenty minutes later and delivered the phone, Scanlon put $80 in the cabbie’s hand—all the cash on him. “He was humbled,” explained Scanlon, “but I wanted him to know how outstanding the act was. He hadn’t mentioned money once. Turning off his meter and going way out of his way to help an irresponsible customer was extraordinary—I’d have given him twice the cash if I had it on me.” This cabbie’s small act of service made a big impact; it turned a nightmare into noteworthy experience. Scanlon calls what Mike did “small-picture thinking.” It is the foundation of leaving others a little better. Somewhere along the way, we were taught to keep the big picture at the forefront of our minds. We learned the benefits of setting big goals, making big connections and closing big deals. Today, the most common big picture may be gaining a big following. And while such big pictures have value, if our minds are focused only on big payoffs, we will overlook the small opportunities that make the biggest difference. We will miss chances to go a little deeper, to connect a little tighter, to make others feel that much better about their relationship with us. “The point,” explained Scanlon, “is not that big-picture thinking is bad. It is a necessary piece of progress—especially with people—but it alone is not enough to reach your big goals.” Many steps come between what we sow and what we reap. Most are small seeds planted in the small moments of every day. Consider the sales manager at Macy’s who cast a big vision to double women’s shoe sales in June. There would be a big summer sale, he explained, and in combination with a big push in upselling, that would turn out big results. What resulted, unfortunately, was no big deal. June 1 came, and his sales force stopped listening to the customers’ stories. They stopped being sensitive to customers’ budgets and considerate of their time. Instead they began fishing for big opportunities to suggest a more expensive shoe or a half-priced second pair or a matching accessory. By month’s end, total sales had decreased by 8 percent. What went wrong? A typical sales manager might blame his sales team for lack of execution. This particular manager pointed the finger at himself. What could he have done differently? He realized his big-picture obsession had taken his team’s focus off the small actions that would make it a reality. It is a common mistake. Fortunately, this particular manager had a second chance. A few months later, Macy’s was having a Labor Day sale. The sales manager took a different approach. He painted the same big picture—double the previous month’s sales—but this time he described the small details within the big picture. He asked his people to look for every opportunity to serve their customers: walk them to the bathroom, hold their babies, park their strollers behind the counter, be mindful of their time commitments and budget constraints. Instead of focusing on what they were selling, the sales team should focus on making their customers’ days a little better, whether or not they bought shoes. What do you think happened? Total sales for September were 40 percent higher than August. It was not a doubling of sales—a goal even the manager admitted was quite lofty—but it was 50 percent better than the same effort in June. Most important, it was progress. The difference was in the details. The big picture didn’t change. The salespeople’s focus did. Instead of looking for the big sell, they sought small, meaningful ways to leave people a little better. The smaller seeds sown meaningfully reaped a bigger harvest. Many people make the mistake of equating inspiration with implementation. They are like an art teacher who sets his students down in an alpine meadow and asks them to reproduce the glorious landscape. The big picture is inspiring: long swaying grass, white aspens with shimmering golden leaves, a brook winding toward the backdrop of snowcapped mountains. But merely seeing the picture does not equip the students to skillfully depict one blade of grass on the canvas. Without instruction in painting each small detail in that big picture, their efforts will look nothing like that picturesque meadow before them. To become great artists who can replicate the big picture, the students must learn to focus on the small particulars. Nowhere in life is this truer than in human relations. Who doesn’t have grand plans for certain partnerships, collaborative efforts, or friendships? A marriage proposal is nothing if not a vision for the future of the relationship. A collaboration agreement is nothing if not a vision for the future of the business partnership. An employment agreement is nothing more than a vision of the great work an employer and employee can accomplish together. But is it enough to wax poetic about your love for the woman? Is it enough to promise great customer service, relevant content, or valuable support? It is said that Leonardo da Vinci began painting Mona Lisa in 1503 and did not finish until 1519. Some art historians speculate he spent much of that span considering and crafting the enigmatic smile that has been the centerpiece of conversation for five centuries. The famous smile now adorns its own $7.5 million room in the Louvre, where 6 million visitors pay their respects each year. The painting’s value is estimated in the ballpark of half a billion U.S. dollars, though most claim she is priceless.2 What would Mona Lisa be without its most famous detail? A big picture that never realized its potential. In the same respect, your biggest and best intentions—for a relationship, for your followership, for a company or collaborative endeavor—will regularly fall short of their potential if your inspirational intentions do not translate into small acts of service and value. “Most business people treat customer service like an ad campaign,” said Scanlon. “They post it, promise it, and promote it. But unless they produce it in small increments every day, customer service is only lip service.” It is Mona Lisa without the smile—a nice effort but not that different from anything, or anyone, else. What you must always remember is that what motivates you to win friends is rarely what motivates others to grant you friendship. You are motivated by what can be achieved with others’ loyalty or support or collaborative effort. You are motivated by the big picture of connection and collaboration—by how things can be. In contrast, those with whom you want to connect and collaborate see only the small pictures of their own experience with you. They see the true measure of your motives in bytes and feats. They are motivated by how things are. Others are constantly asking of you: “How valuable is my relationship with this person?” “What have you done for me lately?” still guides the mind of the masses, perhaps more so today amid the backdrop of millions of messages and messengers vying for attention. This does not suggest, as some believe, that you must continually outdo yourself or that you must parade as a spectacle. It simply means that the secret to all interpersonal progress is adding value, and doing so with regularity. Unfortunately, “in the digital age winning friends has come to be about marketing, about standing out, about being significant,” said legendary peak performance coach Tony Robbins in a recent interview. “There are two ways to be significant,” he explained, “do something really well or do something really poorly. Unfortunately, infamy is the easiest way to get known today. Technology gives us the incredible power to connect with, learn from, and add value to any person on the planet 24/7, and yet we can burn someone or be foolish and get significance instantly. It is unfortunate many people choose that path.”3 Besides the obvious relational consequences of this tack, the strategic problem is that there is no shortage of provocative items being broadcast in the digital age. Between media outlets, marketing campaigns. and me-first digital manners, your competition on the stage of sustaining interest is colossal. And the rewards are famously shallow. The real key to winning friends and influencing people today, says Robbins, is “moving relationships from manipulative to meaningful. The only way you do that is by constantly adding meaning and value.” This is the scale on which every one of your interactions is judged—every tweet, post, email, call, and tangible encounter. To which side does your scale tip in each encounter—toward more value or less value? To which side does your scale tip over time? That is perhaps the more important question, because we all make mistakes. We have bad days. Still, the fallout of interpersonal failures can be swifter and more merciless than it has ever been before. For that reason alone, it is wisest to do everything within your power—through every medium and every message—to leave others a little better. While we certainly have some room for error, it’s more of a laundry room than a grand ballroom. How many times has a mere glance put a relationship on the fritz? Various traditions tell of gods and goddesses of justice. Themis, a Titan, was an organizer of communal affairs. Dike was the Greek goddess of justice, who weighed right and wrong. Justitia was the Roman personification of justice, forced to ascend to the heavens because of the wrongdoing of mortals. Ma’at was the Egyptian goddess who held the universe in order until the moment of creation and then became a heavenly regulator. Out of these gods and goddesses arose a modern personification of Justice, the blindfolded, sword-holding, scale-bearing image associated with Western judicial systems. Her message couldn’t be simpler: truth must be weighed on a case-by-case basis for truth to prevail. A subtler message is this: anything can tip the scales. There isn’t an idle argument or irrelevant fact in a case. The scales of justice measure it all. What’s true in justice holds true in human relationships. There are no neutral exchanges. You leave someone either a little better or a little worse. Jordan was assessing his divorce a decade after it occurred, on the eve of his second wedding. A friend asked why his first one failed. It was, he said, because he neglected the scales. Every single interaction with his spouse sent her one of two messages—that she was the most important person in the world to him or that she wasn’t. He’d sent the latter message far too often. It is unrealistic to expect every exchange with every person to be life-altering. But your scale still tips one way or another every day. Knowing this should give you plenty of reasons to pay attention to every message you send. Placing this high a priority on altruism would set you apart in this digital age. New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote a column called “High-Five Nation” in which he contrasted the humility on display after Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II with what we see on display today. “On the day of victory, fascism had stood for grandiosity, pomposity, boasting and zeal. The allied propaganda mills had also produced their fair share of polemical excess. By 1945, everybody was sick of that. There was a mass hunger for a public style that was understated, self-abnegating, modest and spare.”4 Humility, and the sense that others should occupy our minds as much as if not more than we do, was part of the culture of that era. Over time the sentiment began to change, writes Brooks. “Instead of being humble before God and history, moral salvation could be found through intimate contact with oneself . . . self-exposure and self-love became ways to win shares in the competition for attention.”5 Certainly some people have gained attention today—perhaps “notoriety” is a better word—by worshipping themselves and creating a culture of celebrity around themselves. Some make millions off this strategy. But what is our impression of such people? Do they influence others for good? Perhaps after all the attention, they point people to a cultural good, which is better than nothing. But such people serve primarily as provocateurs. Like wine before a bland meal, they prepare our palate for nothing substantial. There is one thing that hasn’t changed over the millennia—something philosophers from every culture have concluded. It is as old as history itself. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia 2,500 years ago. Confucius preached it in China 2,400 years ago. Lao-tse taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the holy Ganges around the same time. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it 1,000 years before that. They all concluded: Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want them to do to you. Two thousand years ago Jesus put a slightly different spin on it: “Do to others what you would have them do to you.”6 It is the only rule in human history we call golden. An ironic advantage of our digital age is that many people hold a notion of superiority, which affords you a simple way to make a lasting impression: show them in some subtle way they are right. They are far more likely to return the favor. “You know why I like you, Ike?” Winston Churchill asked President Dwight Eisenhower, who had labored, more or less harmoniously, alongside the strong personalities of Bernard Law Montgomery, Charles de Gaulle, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. “Because you ain’t no glory hopper.”7 Always leave people a little better, and you might be surprised how big it makes you and how far it takes you.   Part 3How to Merit and Maintain Others’ Trust   1Avoid Arguments In their book The Preacher and the Presidents, coauthors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy detail the Reverend Billy Graham’s path of unlikely ascendance and unmatched influence with not only seven U.S. presidents but also nearly every other global leader in the Western world. This path, they point out, was not without its resistance, especially early on. How Graham dealt with one of his staunchest opponents provides a preview of the first principle necessary for winning others’ trust. “In February 1954,” they write, “Graham’s patron Henry Luce wrote to TIME’s man in London, the legendary correspondent Andre Laguerre, to prepare him for what was about to come when Graham landed in London for a spring crusade.” This was a time when church membership was much lower in Britain (between 5 and 15 percent of the population) than it was in the United States (59 percent). “ ‘Religion in Britain is near death,’ Luce noted, ‘so Billy’s impact will be worth watching. . . . Surely he will be scorned by all the people you know.’” One of those scorners, explain Gibbs and Duffy, was a columnist from the Daily Mirror, “a man named William Connor, who called Graham ‘Hollywood’s version of John the Baptist.’ As he often did with prominent critics, Graham suggested they meet in person; Connor mischievously suggested a rendezvous at a pub called the Baptist’s Head.” As it turned out, neither Luce, Laguerre, nor Connor could estimate the effect Graham would have on the city. “So many people came the first week that from then on he held three meetings at Harringay Stadium on Saturdays. . . . Night after night eleven thousand people sat and another thousand stood, in rain or sleet or cold, to hear him preach.” His audience included members of Parliament, an admiral, and the navy chief of staff. Nor could the journalists estimate the effect Graham would have on them personally—especially William Connor. After meeting the preacher for a chat at the irreverently named pub, Connor the critic became Connor the admirer. “I never thought,” he confessed of Graham in a subsequent column, “that friendliness had such a sharp cutting edge. I never thought that simplicity could cudgel us sinners so damned hard. We live and learn.”1 While Graham could have employed a front of passive aggression by ignoring the cheeky jabs, or fought the jabs with press-worthy indignation, he chose a higher road, a far more effective path. He avoided an argument altogether and won his critic over with grace and goodwill. Arguing with another person will rarely get you anywhere; they usually end with each person more firmly convinced of his rightness. You may be right, dead right, but arguing is just as futile as if you were dead wrong. Humorist Dave Barry made this point quite well when he said: “I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don’t even invite me.” So much of our time online is spent arguing or feeding arguments. Look no further than comments at the bottom of popular blogs and news sites. It’s nearly always a string of he said/she said or attempts at one-upmanship. Beyond that, the recent and ongoing corporate and political banter seems to primarily involve proving points and stating cases instead of finding common ground on which to build something of mutual value. Few of these arguments change people’s minds. Because the arguments are digitally veiled and lack the clear-cut consequences of tangible confrontations, both parties can get away with devolving into snarky personal attacks and passive ambiguity—the least effective tools of human relations. Such was the case when former BP chief executive Tony Hayward took a hard line of personal self-exoneration and arrogant apathy in reaction to the tragic Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill that took eleven human lives, ravaged the Gulf states ecosystem, and devastated the livelihood of thousands more workers around the country. According to an article in The Times, he started by refuting scientific findings about the nature and amount of the spill. Then his contention that the spill was “tiny” compared to the size of the ocean and that the environmental impact of America’s biggest oil spill, and of the 950,000 gallons of toxic dispersant that have been used to treat it, would be “very, very modest” set off a series of gaffes from which he could not recover, including a backhanded apology to the people of Louisiana in which he stated, “I would like my life back.”2 When, two days after dodging questions and ditching blame before U.S. lawmakers, he was found in Cowes on the southern coast of England for a yacht race in which his boat, Bob, was entered, it merely highlighted what had already been established: whether or not he was right, Hayward had lost both his credibility and his case in the court of public opinion. When influence and impact are at stake, it is often the only court that matters.3 After his line of argument, few could trust the man. He seemed to care about two things and two things only: himself and his empire. Under his argumentative approach, BP quickly went from suspect to reject, regardless of what story the facts would turn out to tell. Wherever BP was sold to consumers, boycotting began. Why fill up at a BP station when there were a dozen others belonging to companies that didn’t have fearlessly uncaring leaders trying to argue their way to exoneration? Some of the chain of reaction was based on perception, of course, but reality remains perception when the facts aren’t clear. And when the case is in the realm of human relations, perception is often so strong that even irrefutable facts are not enough to supplant the wave of bad press that preceded them. In Hayward’s defense, after his dismissal from BP—a day he called one of the saddest of his life—he was far more empathetic not only about his company’s role in the spill but also about his approach to the tragedy. Friends laud Hayward as a kind and generous family man, and there is no doubt they have good reason. Furthermore, BP has been a solid, respectable company for decades. Both deserve to be valued for their finest moments, no less than any of us would had our argumentative approach with a spouse, colleague, or client been widely publicized. And both Hayward and BP still likely will. But why not avoid the valleys in the first place? We will face conflict nearly every day of our lives. So how do we prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument? In the end you must value interdependence higher than independence and understand that deferential negotiation is more effective in the long run than a noncompliant crusade. One South American leader has proven this principle’s merit despite great historical and personal odds. For a man who came from poverty, who led a labor union in a country not known for workers’ rights, who watched his wife die when she was eight months pregnant because they couldn’t afford adequate health care, and who formed his own political party, one might expect a fighter. But Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva, called Lula by all, defied expectations at every turn. “My mother always said two people can’t fight if one person doesn’t want to,” Lula told a reporter once. And so Lula doesn’t fight, an approach that helped him become the president of Brazil and hold the position for almost ten years. When his newly formed socialist party lost elections year after year, he developed an alliance with a right-wing party and courted business leaders despite his social goals. When he became president on the promise to prioritize the impoverished in Brazil, he also built alliances with Brazil’s wealthy and vast upper class by focusing on growing the economy. “I consider myself a negotiator. If we want peace and democracy, we have to be tolerant, to negotiate more,” he has said.4 Lula’s tolerance and negotiation helped him achieve astounding things during his time in office. Through building alliances both domestically and internationally, he enacted social programs that pulled more than twenty million people out of poverty and into the middle class, while also creating a period of strong economic growth and stability. In a country known for the vast divide between the rich and the poor, Lula’s people skills put Brazil on course to reverse historical inequalities.5 The notion of communication has been greatly misinterpreted, explains corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles. “We have come to believe it is all about the delivery. In doing so, we regularly forfeit the full potential [of] our exchanges.”6 Jeles reminds the executives and employees of corporate clients such as Twentieth Century Fox, Leo Burnett, and Harpo, Inc., that there is an important reason all personal growth techniques spring from the act of listening to your inner wisdom. Inside us all is “a vault of better self-understanding, higher knowledge and greater ideas,” she explains. “Tension and conflict occur when you—and/or those with you—discard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard.” How, then, do we build a practice of avoiding arguments? See the singular advantage of operating interdependently. This occurs, says Jeles, when you “acknowledge that greater interpersonal results are always more probable when your experience and insight are compounded with that of others.” No matter how expressive or persuasive you might be, this does not occur by one person trumping another. It occurs when the end result of the tension is a mutual stretching of insight and personal growth. And if you can see your interactions clearly despite tension and conflict, there is little you can’t accomplish in collaboration with others. “All of us know how to get attention,” asserts Jeles, “but few of us know how to get attention and respect at the same time.” Set yourself apart by being one who avoids the arguments that most jump into with both feet.   2Never Say, “You’re Wrong” The best solution, wisest decision, and brightest idea nearly always exist outside of what one party brings to the table. Yet we find it quite easy to declare another person wrong, often before we’ve taken the time to consider what he or she is saying. Even when we believe another is wrong, there is only one way to guarantee an unenviable end to an interaction and all chance of connection or meaningful collaboration, and that is to tell the other person we think so. “Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. Those who learn the wrong lessons from the past may be equally doomed,” writes Harvard Business School professor and coauthor of Negotiation Genius, Deepak Malhotra, in the opening of a Forbes.com article comparing the 2011 NFL revenue share dispute with a similar dispute between the owners and players of the National Hockey League in 2004–5. In both disputes, the owners, concerned about rising costs, asked the players to accept a smaller share of league revenues. In both disputes, the players rejected the owners’ request and asked to see proof of the rising costs. In both disputes, the owners initially refused to substantiate their claims. In the NHL the situation turned dire because neither would back down. “Accusations of greed were rampant,” explains Malhotra. “Unable to bridge the divide even months after the collective bargaining agreement . . . had expired, the NHL eventually canceled the season. Two billion dollars in revenues were lost.” Was the result a foregone conclusion? According to Malhotra, it was avoidable if only the sides had understood the basic human relations problem at the heart of the matter. “Both sides lost the season because the owners refused to acknowledge that players had legitimate concerns. By seeing them as greedy rather than mistrusting, the owners adopted the wrong strategy—intransigence rather than transparency—for too long.” The dispute fell into the trap of “I’m right, you’re wrong” because neither would consider the alternative: that perhaps both were right. There is a critical lesson here. “Negotiations become more productive,” concludes Malhotra, “when each party acknowledges that the other may have legitimate concerns. In the NFL dispute, both the owners and the players need to bring a more nuanced perspective to the bargaining table—or fans across America may be doing something other than watching pro football games next fall.”1 Nuance, or subtle difference, is a critical concept to remember in the midst of disagreement. In most disputes, our differences with others are far subtler than we allow ourselves to see. We so easily treat dissonance like a chasm that cannot be crossed—the only resolution being one party taking a dive (or being shoved) off the cliff, so that only one party remains. It’s far from the truth. “Friendship that insists upon agreement on all matters is not worth the name,” exhorted Mahatma Gandhi. “Friendship to be real must ever sustain the weight of honest differences, however sharp they be.”2 The truth is that disagreement is more often a small crack in the sidewalk that can easily be negotiated if we come to the discussion table with a more open mind. “We talk because we know something,” explained corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles in a recent interview. “Or we think we know something. Or, in the workplace, because there is an expectation that we ‘should’ know something.”3 This expectation of knowledge tends to work against us in interactions because it closes off our minds to the possibilities that exist outside the knowledge we bring to the table. We enter interactions with corroboration in mind, and if that corroboration does not come, we spend the remainder of the interaction attempting to either rebut the other’s assessment or rebuke the other’s right to make an assessment in the first place. The result is that collaboration—or the possibility of it—is forfeited. If that’s your approach, you will rarely progress far in relationships. All effective problem solving, collaboration, and dispute resolution, said Jeles, begins with an emptying of the mind—of what we know or what we think we should know. “This can feel incredibly unnatural,” she admitted, “because we have been trained to demonstrate what we think, to show our knowledge, our smarts—we think therefore we talk.” Yet by approaching a conversation with a blank slate, we take a humbler and more honest approach. We acknowledge the possibility that we may not know all the facts and that we may not in fact be the only one who is right. Better yet, we create the possibility for meaningful collaboration—the melting of thoughts, ideas, and experiences into something greater than the sum of two parties. The notion that we might not be the only one who is right and that we may in fact also be wrong is of course nearly always the case, but we seem so averse to admitting it. Why is that? More often than not it is because we value personal victory over collaborative possibility. Yet in doing so, we not only stunt the relationship, we also punt the probability of greater progress than we originally considered. We expect too little if in the midst of disagreement we only seek a winner. Jeles shared the following story from her experience with a well-known media conglomerate whose swift response to a national disaster caused an aftermath of in-house conflict. Her cell rang at midnight—it was the president of a media conglomerate that had retained her. The man needed Jeles to facilitate a meeting first thing in the morning to deal with an assembly line of catastrophes. The president was referring to the Hurricane Katrina tragedy. In the wake of one of the United States’ worst natural disasters, his company had swiftly deployed 90 percent of its employees to various regions of the Gulf Coast. No planning, no strategy, just some general instructions to come back with the important stories. Now, two weeks later, the teams had returned to the realities of resuming business in the severely disjointed aftermath. “I have four production teams fighting about whose coverage should take priority,” the president explained. “I have legal fighting with production about waiting for proper vetting. And I have accounting fighting with everyone about divvying up the huge expense of the whole thing.” He paused briefly, then went on to tell her how much it had cost: “Six times more than any previous production.” Jeles’s role, said the president, was to meet with all the bickering leadership teams and help them talk it out. Jeles knew precisely what to do. The next morning, as she sat in the auditorium where the meeting was to be held, she watched a familiar sight: the executives and their senior staff each entered the auditorium metaphorically carrying a case—the case they would state to win the dispute. As they settled into their seats, she jumped in with an invitation. “I would like everyone to take a moment and ask yourself this question: ‘What could I have done differently during this assignment that would have helped the other departments succeed?’” In her head, Jeles says, she could hear a series of thuds as the talking heads dropped their verbal cases to the floor. Ears then perked up around the room as, one by one, the team leaders shared their “in the future we could . . .” thoughts. The CFO began by suggesting that his accounting and production teams could lay out a preliminary budget for projects. “We don’t have time,” the executive vice president of production barked back, “for sitting around and making budgets when a story is breaking.” Jeles intervened with a question: “Can you see why accounting is suggesting this practice?” “So we don’t overspend,” the executive vice president replied. “Accounting,” Jeles added, “has an imperative function for the survival of this company, equally as important as production.” She then asked the chief financial officer and the executive vice president of production, “Could your two departments collaborate on creating a preliminary budget for weekly assignments and a breaking news budget with moving caps based on crisis proportions?” Both nodded. The mediation moved on. The company’s chief counsel suggested legal could compose a “most common vetting problems” document so production would know beforehand how to avoid long vetting processes. Jeles looked at the executive vice president, who was nodding. “That would be very helpful,” she agreed. “Done,” replied the chief counsel. The meeting continued in this manner, even going so far as to roll out the specifics of suggested items including budgets and documents. Within thirty minutes, everyone in the room was in agreement about the solutions. The meeting was formally adjourned, and it was then that perhaps the most surprising thing of all happened: many executives and their staff stayed behind to capitalize on the collaboration momentum. As Jeles picked up her bag to leave, the president approached. “In twenty-five years,” he asserted, “I have never attended a meeting where there were more people listening than talking.” In the spirit of all great artisans who begin with only a blank page, white canvas, or lump of clay, we must enter all disputes with a mind open to what more we might discover and produce together. Only then can our true interpersonal potential be tapped. On June 26, 2000, in the White House’s East Room, where Teddy Roosevelt used to box, where Amy Carter had her high school prom, and where Lewis and Clark once camped in their tents, President Bill Clinton announced the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome. “Humankind is on the verge of gaining immense, new power to heal,” he remarked.4 Next to him stood Dr. Francis Collins, noted geneticist and the head of the Human Genome Project. For seven years he had led an international team of more than a thousand scientists in what Time journalist J. Madeleine Nash called “the challenge of pulling off a technological tour de force that many ranked alongside splitting the atom and landing men on the moon. ‘There is only one human genome project, and it will happen only once,’ Collins said at the time. ‘The chance to stand at the helm of that project and put my own personal stamp on it is more than I could imagine.’ “5 That Collins had to do it while competing against a former colleague made it all the more interesting. In May 1998, five years after Collins agreed to helm the project, Craig Venter, a passionate NIH biologist who was among the countless scientists dedicated to harnessing genomes to cure diseases, announced he was founding a company to scoop Collins’s project by four years. The “race” between Collins and Venter made for great press. Central to ongoing commentary were the two men’s very different personalities—one brash, one reserved. And Collins, the reserved one, had little choice but to compete. Doing so meant getting scientists from six countries, numerous government agencies, and many more numerous university labs to work together for a common interest rather than individual glory. So it was even more remarkable that in the East Room that day Francis Collins introduced Craig Venter this way: “Articulate, provocative and never complacent, he has ushered in a new way of thinking about biology. . . . It is an honor and a pleasure to invite him to tell you about this landmark achievement.” Collins chose a path of cooperation and partnership and resisted the temptation to proclaim Venter wrong. Ultimately, he merely saw him as different. But different didn’t have to mean opposed. While Collins admits the two are “different people . . . wired in a different way,” Time’s Nash points out, “Collins now says that he considers Venter to have ‘been a stimulant in a very positive way.’” At the heart of the assertion that others are wrong is actually an unspoken admittance that we don’t want to be rejected. It is in the spirit of not wanting to be wrong ourselves that we project that role on others. If not for a pointed patent leather reminder, Dale Carnegie himself would have fallen prey to this unenviable reaction. Shortly after the close of World War I, he was the business manager for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in Palestine; shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him fifty thousand dollars, the king of England knighted him, and for a while he was the talk of the global town. Carnegie was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honor, and during the dinner, the man sitting next to him told a humorous story that hinged on the quotation “There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.” The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong, and Carnegie knew it positively. By his own admission, he appointed himself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct the storyteller. The other man stuck to his guns. From Shakespeare? Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And the man knew it. Frank Gammond, an old friend of Carnegie’s, was seated to his left. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare. So the storyteller and Carnegie agreed to submit the question to the expert. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked Carnegie under the table, and then said, “Dale, you are wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.” On their way home that night, Carnegie said to Mr. Gammond, “Frank, you knew that quotation was from Shakespeare.” “Yes, of course,” he replied, “Hamlet, act five, scene two. But we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Always avoid the acute angle.” It taught Carnegie a lesson he never forgot. Telling people they are wrong will only earn you enemies. Few people respond logically when they are told they are wrong; most respond emotionally and defensively because you are questioning their judgment. You shouldn’t just avoid the words “You’re wrong.” You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture, so you must guard against showing judgment in all of the ways that you communicate. And if you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. It is easy to allow a certain tone to creep into our online communication, a tone that tells another person that we believe he or she is wrong. Sometimes we don’t even realize the tone is there until we read what we’ve written sometime later. We believe we are being diplomatic, but each word, presented in absence of expression or a soft tone of voice, is usually a condemnation. This is one of the reasons settling disputes is best accomplished in person. Instead of presenting a truncated argument through email, IM, or Twitter, create a more respectful, conciliatory environment for conversation. Then offer your point with an open mind. While you in fact might be right and the other person wrong, there is no sense in denting a person’s ego or permanently damaging a relationship. If you remember those who obstinately insisted you were wrong, you can be certain others will remember you in that same negative light if you choose to turn an interaction into an opportunity to teach a lesson instead of a chance to strengthen a relationship. Always default to diplomacy. Admit that you may be wrong. Concede that the other person may be right. Be agreeable. Ask questions. And above all, consider the situation from the other’s perspective and show that person respect. Such a humble approach leads to unexpected relationships, unexpected collaboration, and unexpected results.   3Admit Faults Quickly and Emphatically Only slightly less of a cliché than “The check is in the mail” is this: “The ref blew the call.” While the sport and circumstances vary, referees regularly make mistakes. Occasionally the consequences are significant. Around the world some are so famous they have their own monikers. Take the “hand of God” goal, for instance. In the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals, Argentina and England were locked in a scoreless tie when Argentina’s captain, Diego Maradona, leapt high in the air over goalie Peter Shilton and punched the ball into the net. The referee, Ali Bin Nasser, didn’t see the handball and ruled the goal legal. Then there was Jeffrey Maier. In the 1996 American League Championship Series, the Orioles led the Yankees 4–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter hit a long fly ball into right field. The twelve-year-old Maier reached over the wall and caught the ball, preventing Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco from making the play. Umpire Rich Garcia improperly called a home run instead of an out or automatic double. The Yankees went on to win the game. Add to these incidents ten thousand other blown calls, and fan exasperation at referee errors can be faintly understood. Certainly we are passionate about our teams. But referees are human, after all, and we can understand making mistakes. What makes exasperation linger, however, is the inability or unwillingness of the referees to admit their mistakes. That is what makes one of the worst examples of referee error so extraordinary—and ultimately redeeming. It’s been called the “perfect game robbery.” Since 1900—the generally recognized start of baseball’s modern era—nearly four hundred thousand games have been played in the United States. During this span only eighteen times has a pitcher delivered perfection, retiring every opposing batter in order without giving up a walk or a hit and without his teammates putting a runner on base with an error. To put this in perspective, the odds of a perfect game being thrown in baseball (one in twenty thousand) are far smaller than the chance you will be struck by lightning in your lifetime.1 But a perfect game is precisely what Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga had happening one early June evening in 2010. He’d recorded twenty-six consecutive outs and had gotten the twenty-seventh batter to tap a weak ground ball to the first baseman. Galarraga ran from the mound, took the throw from the first baseman, tagged the bag ahead of the runner and got ready to celebrate. There was only one problem: the umpire, Jim Joyce, swung his arms wide and shouted, “Safe!” Galarraga’s perfect game had been lost in one of the most egregious blown calls in sports history. But here is where things took an equally unexpected turn. It is perhaps the most significant and memorable detail of the story. When he got back to the umpire’s locker room, Joyce immediately cued the game video and watched the play—only once. He saw how badly he’d blown the call. But instead of letting the dust settle in silence like so many of his colleagues, Joyce chose a different path. He walked straight to the Detroit Tigers locker room and requested an audience with Galarraga. Face red as a tomato, tears in his eyes, he hugged Galarraga and managed to get out two words before dissolving into tears: “Lo siento.” He apologized boldly and unreservedly. In doing so he changed sports history. There had been previous perfect games in baseball, but this was the first redemption game. There are many things that are common to us all—birth, death, and a lifetime full of mistakes, errors, and gaffes. We all know this, and the vast majority of our mistakes, while temporarily frustrating and even maddening to others, are forgivable. Why, then, do we have such a hard time admitting them? Take Tiger Woods, for example. His Thanksgiving-night car crash outside his home quickly triggered seemingly endless accusations and allegations of extramarital affairs. Where once rumors of affairs would be passed around town as unsubstantiated gossip, our digital age can broadcast, accuse, and convict almost overnight. Woods’s response? A prepared, vague admission of his “transgressions” and a request for privacy. His professional and personal world soon collapsed around him. Sponsors dropped him, his wife left him, and his golf skills suffered greatly. Could he have taken a different road? Of course. In the first weeks of the breaking news, before the fallout of endorsement deals being cancelled or Woods’s wife’s departure, PR experts pointed to a different approach that could have stopped the bleeding much sooner. In a Phoenix Business Journal article, journalist Mike Sunnucks cited Abbie Fink of HMA Public Relations: Fink said Woods and his camp chose silence over getting in front of a story that ended up being driven by TMZ and the National Enquirer. “In the absence of anything coming from Tiger, the media will go find the sources elsewhere. And after today’s news, it would appear that there are plenty of people willing to share their side of the story,” Fink said. Troy Corder, a principal with Critical Public Relations in Phoenix, said the Woods camp made numerous mistakes including essentially lying, hunkering down with a bunker mentality and not being ready to respond to tabloid reports, which have been true in part.2 A sincere and swift apology, publicly made, would have brought him to earth in the right sort of way. He had been an untouchable icon. A quick and emphatic admission not only would have cleared the air but also would have confirmed to people he was like all of us, human, mistake-prone, and messy—something we all knew anyway. That would have only helped him return to others’ good graces much sooner. Digital Royalty CEO Amy Martin observed at the time: Tiger should humanize his brand via social media outlets, specifically with Twitter and real-time raw video. His Facebook presence has a polished and promotional tonality leaving fans wanting a glimpse behind-the-scenes. . . . If he had allowed people to see the person behind the superstar personality, perceptions and expectations could have been different in recent events.3 Unfortunately, it was not the road Tiger’s team chose after the events that changed the course of his career. And the dust took much longer to settle. Such is the effect of ignoring this principle in the digital age. Negative news spreads faster than ever. If you’ve made a mistake, it is far better that you control the news being spread. Come clean quickly and convincingly. One reason we find it so difficult to admit our faults is that we are inclined to forget the messages that apologies bear. This forgetfulness is all the more dangerous today. If we admit our faults immediately and emphatically, it is like shooting a full-page press release across the wires that confirms we genuinely care about the people we hurt, that we are humbled, and that we want to make things right. People rarely hold on to anger and disappointment when they can see that we view ourselves and the situation properly. We are much more forgiving of those who are willing to come clean right away. Contrast the public’s view today of baseball slugger Jason Giambi, who immediately and tearfully admitted steroid use as the scandal was coming to light, against former slugger Mark McGwire, who waited five years to clear the air. Giambi had his life back rather quickly. The public was gracious and quick to forgive. While McGwire certainly had his reasons for delaying his explanation, in many baseball fans’ minds he forever wears a scarlet S on his chest. A half decade after his stellar career ended, he still remained a long way off from receiving the Hall of Fame induction that was once a foregone conclusion. If we are aloof and ambiguous about our mistakes, we also shoot out a full-page press release, but one that reads: “I would like my life back.” While we’d all like our pre-mistake lives back after a mistake has been made, we have to remember that no one changed the circumstances but us. It is not others’ duty to give us back the life we took from ourselves. Only we can get our life back. That always begins with admitting our faults quickly and emphatically. What all of us at one time or another forget is that there is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one’s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness but also often helps solve the problem created by the error much quicker. Ronald Reagan was known as the “Great Communicator” because, to the joy of his supporters and the consternation of his critics, he could move from a place of defensive weakness to undeniable strength with a simple quip. One of his tried-and-true methods? An easy familiarity with the apology. During one particularly rocky patch of his presidency, he poked fun at his own White House, conceding, “Our right hand doesn’t know what our far right hand is doing.”4 Reagan knew it was easier to bear self-condemnation than condemnation from others. If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it better to beat the other person to the punch? When we recognize and admit our errors, the response from others is typically forgiveness and generosity. Quickly the error is diminished in their eyes. It is only when we shirk responsibility or refuse to admit our errors immediately that we raise the ire of those around us and the original misjudgment seems to grow in importance and negative effect. Today we have the opportunity to broadcast our apologies, to let everyone involved know we made an error and are sorry for it. We nip negative opinions in the bud when we take that action. And we gain people’s respect, because it takes courage to admit our faults publicly. It also takes courage to admit our faults privately. Consider our families. How hard is it for husbands and wives to admit their mistakes to each other? It’s akin to stabbing yourself in the gut. But no matter what that mistake may have been, it is crucial to choose the path of humility and rely on the power of forgiveness. Anne was a successful finance executive and mother of three. Honors graduate of an Ivy League school, she’d never really failed at anything. She married the man of her dreams and then one night found herself hanging out with some of her buddies from work while at an out-of-town convention. One drink led to two, and two to four, and the group of buddies got smaller until it was just a male coworker and her. They decided to leave the bar, and in the elevator they kissed. A few more floors and footsteps later and they stood outside her hotel room door. She opened it. They kissed again. Then they stopped. He backed away and so did she. Each was married; they loved their spouses. They kissed again. And then they stopped, and he left and the door closed behind him. Anne went to bed alone . . . and then woke up to the nightmare that she’d betrayed the man of her dreams. She went home two days later and said nothing for six years. It was a mistake. A one-time mistake with only one witness, who wasn’t going to say anything either. The years passed with the memory locked away in a mental and emotional safe. She knew that if this secret got out, it would be the end of her life as the one who had it all together, the one who made no mistakes. But one evening, while on vacation, she told her husband everything. He looked at her and started crying. Of all the reactions she’d considered, that hadn’t been one of them. Over the next several weeks, they talked to each other, to their friends, and to their pastor. Her husband grieved, and with every minute of his grief her own heart broke. But something else broke as well—her mask of perfectionism. As friends learned of her mistake, she was overwhelmed by the very thing she never considered possible—grace and forgiveness. She discovered that the truth did indeed have the power to set her free. Anne’s mistake was not without consequence, but in admitting the mistake and seeking forgiveness, she allowed room for a different perspective on her life, a perspective in which she was safe being imperfect. If only she had given herself room six years sooner. The same perspective exists for us all if we are brave enough to own it. Any fool can defend a mistake—and most fools do—but admitting your mistake raises you above the pack and gives you a feeling of exultation. At the end of 2010, people in the sports world engaged in that casual end-of-year discussion about whom Sports Illustrated would name as its “Sportsman of the Year.” The honor ended up going to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees for leading the once hapless Saints to their first-ever Super Bowl victory. It was a fitting selection. But Chris Harry of AOLnews.com believed two different men should have shared the prize instead. “As far as sheer sportsmanship, to me, nothing compared to the fallout from the night of June 3.” Harry goes on to recount the now-famous story of the blown perfect game and concludes: About 16 hours later, the Tigers and Indians played again, but the meeting that mattered came before the game when Galarraga was tabbed for the trip to home plate to turn in the lineup card. Joyce was waiting for him. The two exchanged handshakes and hugs in one of the most inspiring, emotional and moving displays of sportsmanship any sport had ever seen. It was a moment worthy of being relived and helped us learn a lesson about invoking class and dignity when circumstances very easily—especially in this day and age—could have brought about a very different reaction.5 Oh, the power of two words to change everything: “Lo siento. I’m sorry.”   4Begin in a Friendly Way “Successful leaders . . . are always initiators,” writes leadership expert John C. Maxwell in his flagship book The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. He then recalls an instance where beginning in a friendly way was not only necessary but highly recommended. Still a young man, he had been hired to take over the leadership of a troubled church in Lancaster, Ohio, where he was told a large and intimidating man named Jim Butz, the elected lay leader of the congregation, was the most influential person in the organization. He was also told Jim had a reputation for maverick behavior that at times had led the church down the wrong path. The first thing Maxwell did was arrange a meeting with Jim in his office. It could have been an awkward or even grossly misperceived moment—a twenty-five-year-old rookie summoning the sixty-five-year-old patriarch to meet with him—but Maxwell dispelled that notion immediately. The second Jim sat down, Maxwell began with a humble acknowledgment of the situation. Jim was the influencer in the church, and Maxwell wanted to work with him, not against him. Maxwell then suggested they meet once a week for lunch to talk through the issues and make decisions together. “While I’m the leader here,” said Maxwell, “I’ll never take any decision to the people without first discussing it with you. I really want to work with you. . . . We can do a lot of great thing together at this church, but the decision is yours.” When he finished, Maxwell explains, “Jim didn’t say a word. He got up from his seat, walked into the hall, and stopped to take a drink at the water fountain. I followed him out and waited. After a long time, he stood up straight and turned around. . . . I could see that tears were rolling down his cheeks. And then he gave me a great big bear hug and said, ‘You can count on me to be on your side.’”1 Friendliness begets friendliness. We are more inclined to agree with another person or see things from his perspective when we have friendly feelings toward him. If, in contrast, we feel a person is busy or brusque or uninterested in sharing a common courtesy, we tend to mirror the sentiment. This is a difficult obstacle to overcome whether you’ve just met the person or have known him awhile. Where the initiation of interactions is concerned, no approach sets the tone more effectively than gentleness and affability, even if the other person is a source of pain, frustration, or anger. A friendly greeting says: “You are worth my time. You are valuable.” This subtle message has tremendous power—more than most realize. In The Seven Arts of Change, author David Shaner shares an incredible experience that taught him the immense power of beginning in a friendly way.2 He had been recruited by a longtime friend to teach Ki-Aikido at the Aspen-Snowmass Academy of Martial Arts, just up the road from Pitkin County, a Colorado locale made famous in 1970 when American journalist Hunter S. Thompson ran for sheriff on the “Freak Ticket,” promoting the decriminalization of drugs for personal use, turning asphalt streets into grassy meadows, banning buildings that obscured the mountain view, and renaming Aspen “Fat City” to deter investors. Thompson narrowly lost the election that year, but his sentiment set the stage for another, less controversial, but equally unconventional man to become sheriff. His name was Dick Kienast, whose campaign poster had cited Sissela Bok’s vision of societal values: “Trust is a social good to be protected just as much as the air we breathe or the water we drink.”3 Kienast believed civility and compassion should rule all law enforcement interaction whether it involved violent felons or frustrated traffic offenders. “It was a momentous change initiative,” writes Shaner, “and one that many thought foolish and unnecessary. . . . Nevertheless, he moved forward in confidence.” Among Shaner’s first Ki-Aikido students at Aspen-Snowmass Academy were Sheriff Kienast and his deputies. Bob Braudis was one of Kienast’s key deputies and would go on to succeed him as Pitkin County sheriff. Before then Deputy Braudis would establish his legacy with a compelling display of beginning in a friendly way. Braudis was an imposing presence and fit the stereotype of a brawny, no-nonsense cop. This presence served as a stark and effective contrast to his demeanor with people. He never raised his voice, even in the midst of volatile situations. One event serves as a case in point. While Deputy Braudis was the patrol director, a dispatch came through that an armed man was holding all the patrons hostage at a local restaurant called the Woody Creek Tavern. Braudis was the first to arrive on the scene, and from outside the building he was apprised of the situation. The man’s estranged wife was prohibiting him from visiting his daughter, whom he had seen in the restaurant. Rather than attempting a peaceful greeting, something clicked inside the man. He yanked out a gun and forced everyone inside to comply with his wishes. Deputy Braudis assessed the danger and took a different tack. He peacefully approached the window unarmed. Sensing the deputy’s affability, the gunman allowed him to enter the building. Braudis then proceeded to address the man in a civil manner, asking him to consider the consequences of his actions, which could ultimately lead to him never seeing his daughter again. “Bob’s placid demeanor, his rational discussion of the real issues, and his empathy toward the man’s rage validated the suspect,” writes Shaner. “And the more the man talked with Bob, the more he realized that much of his anger was with himself. He eventually put down his weapon. The man’s whole demeanor then changed. . . . Bob explained that exiting the tavern with cuffs on would put all the law enforcement people outside the tavern at ease so that neither Bob nor the suspect would run the risk of being shot. The man complied, and the conflict was ended peacefully.”4 Consider this story the next time you sit down to write an email to somebody who has made you frustrated or angry. Will you begin with a civil, courteous tone or let your emotions take over and jump into conflict? Will you take a few moments to inquire about the other person’s life or work situation or to create a bond through some shared interest by telling them something about yourself? If you begin in a friendly manner, you are far more likely to get the positive results you seek, especially if you and the other person are currently at odds. “I do not like that man,” Abraham Lincoln once said. “I must get to know him better.”5 If you believe building a friendly rapport will be critical to achieving a certain outcome, using texts, chats, or other short forms of communication isn’t likely to get you very far. Because of the limited space and the lack of intonation and nonverbal cues to support your sentiment, it’s very difficult to create the level of communication necessary to convey affability. If face-to-face is not possible, at least use a medium that will allow time and space to convey a level of friendliness that in Carnegie’s time ruled human relations. It takes creativity and a bit more time to replicate the effect of a warm smile and a firm handshake, but it can be done. “Social media requires that business leaders start thinking like small-town shop owners,” concurs entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, who wrote The Thank You Economy. This means taking the long view and avoiding short-term benchmarks to gauge progress. . . . In short, business leaders are going to have to relearn the ethics and skills our great-grandparents’ generation used in building their own businesses and took for granted. . . . [O]nly the companies that can figure out how to mind their manners in a very old-fashioned way—and do it authentically—are going to have a prayer of competing.6 There was an age when people left their houses in their best attire and said hello to all they passed on the way to work, when a meeting meant meeting and when a call meant paying someone a visit rather than using the phone. While our transactions span the globe today, making such tangible connection more infrequent, it is still key to treat others in the same spirit you would if they were before you. Of his growing wine empire, Vaynerchuk explains, “We talk to every single individual as though we’re going to be sitting next to that person at his or her mother’s house that night for dinner.”7 It’s the proper perspective because it places the burden of accountability squarely where it should be—on the messenger’s shoulders. The mistake many make today is placing the burden of accountability on the recipient of the message. We use the responses and reactions of others as the only gauge of whether we have taken the right approach or made the right impression. This is a slippery slope on two fronts. First, it can lead to laziness in considering motive’s role in effective connection. If garnering a great response is the only measure of connection, then we easily become mere entertainers, provocateurs, and product pimps who think only about the next great gimmick to grab people’s interest. Shock value is worth little where true connection is concerned. Second, responses can be deceptive, especially in the beginning. A tweet may garner many retweets, but this does not mean that those relaying your message to others have become fans or even friends. They may be thinking of someone else who might benefit from the message or might want to consider the product; worse, they may have in mind someone who would laugh alongside the retweeter at your lack of knowledge, sincerity, or tact. An online marketing campaign might generate a spike in site traffic or a print media campaign lots of journalistic buzz, but wise businesspeople know this does not mean relationships are being formed. There is a big difference between engagement and interest. Interest is piqued in a number of ways, many of which are less than genial. It often begins and ends on a superficial level because the primary emotions tapped are curiosity, surprise, or disgust. Engagement occurs on a deeper level when a person’s core values are tapped. Common to all core values is the notion of being considered worthy of relationship. When you engage another in a friendly manner, you convey to him he is someone worthy of friendship, someone whom you’d like to call friend. It is for this reason “he who sows courtesy reaps friendship.”8 If you want your voice to reach through the noise and beneath the surface to others’ motives for moving in your direction, begin in a friendly way. The first impression that makes is far more memorable than anything the loudest or most provocative attention-grabber on the planet could come up with. Years ago, when Carnegie was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school in northwest Missouri, he read a fable about the sun and the wind. It serves as a vivid reminder of the power of this principle of earning others’ trust. The sun and wind debated about which was the stronger, and the wind said, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.” So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him. Finally the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, the man mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then reminded the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force. It’s a timely lesson in an age that appears to divvy rewards based on greatest volume, speed, and splash. Such rewards mean little in the long run because engagement that engenders longevity is continually authenticated on mutual benefit and trust. If you don’t establish a foundation for both from the beginning through a friendly sentiment, both become more difficult to secure with each passing day. Wait too long or take too many shallow shots at attention and you’ll be left trying to talk the other into a relationship. It’s never the place you want to be—begging for commitment. “Engagement has to be heartfelt,” writes Vaynerchuk, “or it won’t work. . . . You cannot underestimate people’s ability to spot a soulless, bureaucratic tactic a million miles away. It’s a big reason why so many companies that have dipped a toe in social media waters have failed miserably.”9 Winning friends begins with friendliness.   5Access Affinity Like. Friend. Follow. Share. In the digital age, affinity often exists before we share the first hello. In Carnegie’s time friendship and commonality walked hand in hand. You met. You talked. You found common ground and with it a fondness that led to deeper friendship. Today people follow you on Twitter or belong to the same Facebook group or “like” your latest video on YouTube before you ever meet. Often there are numerous threads of affinity before you actually meet. With the particulars of what we like and dislike—digital buttons and thumbs-up included—we give and are given permission to make agreements and disagreements based solely on affinity. We have points of affinity and points of dissonance, and more often than not, we gravitate and grant influence to those with whom we have the most in common. This can be a tremendous boost to building lasting relationships in which influence exists. We are not speaking of the law of attraction. You can think about having lots of friends with whom you have lots of influence, but nothing much will change if you don’t take genuine, meaningful action to build those relationships. We are speaking of what author John C. Maxwell calls “the law of magnetism.” “Effective leaders are always on the lookout for good people,” he writes. Think about it. Do you know who you’re looking for right now? What is your profile of perfect employees? What qualities do these people possess? Do you want them to be aggressive and entrepreneurial? Are you looking for leaders? Do you care whether they are in their twenties, forties, or sixties? . . . Now, what will determine whether the people you want are the people you get, whether they will possess the qualities you desire? You may be surprised by the answer. Believe it or not, who you get is not determined by what you want. It’s determined by who you are.1 Like attracts like—in character and commonality. Today, however, we can have a head start. We can ascertain affinity before we approach a person. Liking serves, in the digital age, as a perfect door to influence. When someone joins the same Facebook group, follows your blog, or comments on a website, he or she is saying yes to you. That creates an intensely powerful position to hold if you want to influence that person. When a person says no and really means it, a physiological cascade of reactions is taking place that is putting the person in a defensive position, ready to withdraw. But when this same person says yes and really means it, he is in a position of acceptance, of openness, of moving forward. So the more yeses you can get at the outset of an interaction, even if they have little to do with the ultimate proposal, the more likely you are to put the person in a mood to agree with you along the way. Getting to yes is so much easier if you start with yes. We have an obvious opportunity—a positive position from which to start dialogue. With the vast opportunities available to us to connect with the people who are interested in who we are and what we have to say, there is little excuse for starting a relationship, or even a conversation, on the wrong foot. More than that, organizations have the power to get their constituents saying yes based purely on the influence of the community. Microsoft understood this well when it released Windows 7. The computer giant had been dealt a blow with the exasperating launch of Windows Vista, a universally derided operating system. But it was ready to reenter the fray with Windows 7, and it had learned from past experiences. It had to get its customers, its users, onboard right from the start. It had to get them saying yes. First it had to find its fans, the potential influencers in the community of PC users. In Empowered, authors Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler explore Microsoft’s strategy for getting back in the ring. To combat the slick Mac-versus-PC commercials that depicted the PC as a nerdy, inefficient, outdated number cruncher, it solicited “I’m a PC” videos directly from users via a YouTube channel. It edited them together to create a powerful beginning to their yes-based marketing campaign. When it released a beta version of Windows 7 to targeted users, it trolled the feedback on blogs, Twitter, Facebook, discussion forums, and other social communities. In preparation for the market release, it created a moderated feed of the content posted on a host of other sites and platforms and presented the feed on its website, Facebook page, and elsewhere. It created advertising featuring users, highlighting the concept that Windows 7 was designed in part as a result of customer suggestions. The tagline: “I’m a PC, and Windows 7 was my idea.” The coup de grâce, though, was how it got its fans to celebrate Windows 7 and to share it with others. It offered an opportunity to its fans—it made them feel important. If you were a Windows 7 fan you could sign up to have a party in your home to show off the new features—Microsoft would send along materials. . . . Word about the party opportunities spread through social media and before long, tens of thousands of people in fourteen countries had signed up. Microsoft estimates that the parties reached about eight hundred thousand people, including hosts and guests.2 Considering how the release of Windows Vista had gone, PC users could have said no to Windows 7 right from the start, but Microsoft got them to say yes. When we start with yes, at the most basic level we are creating affinity. But to turn affinity into influence, there must remain a foundation of empathy. We must be able to constantly see the interaction from another’s point of view so that we know the ultimate value of our points of affinity. Rather than use social media opportunities to help us start from yes and maintain that necessary commitment, we often ignore what it is that others want and bombard them with our pitch. Instead of getting them to say, “Yes! Yes!” we force them to say, “Stop! Stop!” Social media guru Chris Brogan calls it the blizzard of business rather than a communication snowfall: Conversations and relationships are based on several touches. In the traditional marketing and communication world, people would use each touch to ask for something, to issue a call to action. This isn’t how social networks work. . . . They are there to give you permission to reach someone who has opted into a relationship with you. . . . It’s a snowfall. Every individual flake doesn’t mean a lot, but the body of work can change everything.3 You have to offer them what they want in your communication if you want to begin and remain at yes. Only then have you earned a level of trust that permits you to confidently offer others your pitch, whether it is for a product, service, or cause. Of course, this principle is equally relevant and required outside of the digital realm. A newspaper company had a policy of delivering a new paper to customers who called to complain that their papers had been damaged by inclement weather. But over time rising gas prices and fewer subscriptions made it financially impossible to maintain the practice. So they sent what they believed to be a very friendly letter to their customers. It began something like this: Dear valued customer, We will no longer deliver replacement newspapers when previously delivered newspapers have been damaged by weather. They went on to explain the change in policy. And then, at the very end of the letter, they wrote this: If you do receive a damaged newspaper, please let us know and we will refund the price of the newspaper on your next bill. The first response customers might have when reading this letter is irritation and protest. By the end of the letter, they’re too worked up to care that an alternative—and possibly a better one—is being offered. What if, instead, the company had written the letter as follows: Dear valued customer, We recognize how frustrating it can be when the paper you receive is damaged due to the weather. (Yes, it is!) You pay for a product and service and expect quality in both areas. (Yes, I do!) Consequently, we will now offer a full refund for any paper you receive that has been rendered unreadable because of the weather. (Really? Great!) We also wanted to make you aware that, like you, our business has been affected by rising gas prices. Consequently, we will no longer be able to offer to deliver replacement papers. Just call us, and you will receive a refund instead. (Oh, okay.) At the very least, customers might have viewed the actions of the company in a much more favorable light. Today, there are two kinds of agreement. We need to keep both in mind where our interactions are concerned. The first kind of agreement is the common variety. It is the sort that surrounds two parties holding the same opinion on a particular issue. The presumption with this kind of agreement is that they were engaged at one time in a dialogue in which they uncovered their harmony of opinion. For most of us this sort of dialogue-based agreement is the only kind of agreement we consider. But there is another kind of agreement that was far less feasible during Carnegie’s time but has become all the more important today. This second kind of agreement is based on two parties liking the same thing—or, as we might view it, being similar people. We don’t typically call this sort of harmony an “agreement,” but in the digital age it is best to think of it as such because we are always drawn to those with whom we have something in common. Establishing this commonality or affinity at the outset is a new form of yes. The more early yeses you possess, the more likely you are to succeed in capturing a yes to your idea, solution, or transaction. Access affinity as early and often as possible.   6Surrender the Credit A Dale Carnegie Training student in Australia relayed the following story, which serves as a good lesson for what can happen when we ignore this principle. My business partner and I operated one of the largest IT retailers in Brisbane. We had eight stores, employed more than sixty staff members, and had a turnover of more than $10m per year. Although my business partner had helped me a lot and he was a reasonably easygoing person, I believed all the success was contributed by me. There was only one way to run the company and it was my way. When there was a likelihood of an argument, I made sure it became an argument and tried to win it regardless of the cost. I never began our meetings in friendly fashion and often talked down to him. I never considered his feelings and even wondered why he wasn’t more like me. In the end I won all the arguments and had my way, but I lost the partnership and subsequently the company. After I learned this principle I started looking back and now understand how wrong I was. I often think if I had known these things sooner, how different my business would be today. I know I can’t change the past now, but I can see the mistakes I made and try to not repeat them. Today this gentleman is a different person. “Now I always ask my partners about their goals before I set my own,” he writes. “Then I ask myself, ‘What can I do to help this relationship lead to their goals?’” While it’s easy to see why we want credit for successes for which we labored, claiming the credit will never win you friends. It will also diminish your influence quicker than just about any other action. What is the worst quality in a leader? Ask the followers and they would tell you it is the quality of taking credit when things go well and dishing out blame when things go wrong. Few postures send a clearer “It’s all about me” message. Few messages send people scurrying in the other direction faster. Who wants a friend who thinks it’s all about them? Who wants a leader who doesn’t see your contributions? The answers to those questions are easy. Answering the opposite questions is just as easy: Who wants a friend who doesn’t care who gets the credit? Who wants a leader who sees the full value of your contribution? “Giving away credit is a magical multiplier,” writes Forbes blogger August Turak, a former founding employee at MTV. It works equally well in business and in our personal lives. But harnessing this magic requires an attitude of gratitude. Without a sincere sense of gratitude, sharing credit is just another manipulative trick bound to backfire. . . . None of this is rocket science. It’s common sense. So why is credit stolen far more often than shared? The usual suspect is fear.1 But fear, in this case, should be reserved for the possibility of becoming a person who is afraid to share the spoils of success. Turak shares a homily he once heard that makes this point well: “The Sea of Galilee is teeming with fish and life,” the priest began. “The Dead Sea is dead and devoid of life. They are both fed by the sparkling water of the River Jordan, so what’s the difference? The Sea of Galilee gives all its water away. The Dead Sea keeps it all for itself. Like the Dead Sea, when we keep all that is fresh and good for ourselves, we turn our lives into a briny soup of salty tears.” Surrendering the credit for a job or project can’t be a false humility, a covert approach to seeking the spotlight. This is a form of the martyr syndrome. The principle suggested here is born not of attention-seeking activity but rather of a supreme confidence that you are a far better person when those around you know they play an important role not only in a collaborative success but also in your personal success. Watch any film or music awards show and you will see this dynamic in action, especially in the more magnanimous participants. What is the first gesture expected of the winner of an award? An acceptance speech. And what are acceptance speeches but a list of thank-yous to those who were responsible for the winner’s success? Some would argue this is merely standard show script, but those faces behind the names would have something else to say. As the camera swings to show these faces, all are beaming—some even crying joyful tears, sharing in the success, and reciprocating the gratitude. It is perhaps no coincidence that Greer Garson, the woman credited with the longest acceptance speech in Oscar history at five and a half minutes, is also the co–record holder with Bette Davis for the most consecutive Best Actress Oscar nominations at five. Could it be that all that gratitude was a big part of the reason she was so successful? It’s often said that to be successful you must surround yourself with successful people. While there is truth to the statement, few see that there are two ways to approach this positioning. Either you can seek friendships with those who are already successful, or you can seek success for those who are already friends. Whichever way you choose, one thing is certain: your success is always commensurate with the number of people who want to see you successful. But one way provides better numbers. When you seek friendships with those who are successful, there is no guarantee they will want success for you too. You might have to work to overcome being perceived as a relational leech. On the other hand, when you seek success for those who are already friends, you can just about guarantee that these same people will want success for you. Surrendering the credit is a way of life you cultivate in your relationships because you are grateful for them and for what they give to you. It is nothing more than putting the success and betterment of others first—and putting your confidence in both who you are and in the rubberlike power of reciprocity. Mark Twain certainly possessed the former; and Henry Irving could not accuse him of at least trying to put confidence in the latter. There’s an amusing anecdote about a conversation between the two literary contemporaries that neatly demonstrates this principle. Henry Irving was telling Mark Twain a story. “You haven’t heard this, have you?” he inquired after the preamble. Twain assured him he had not. A little later Irving again paused and asked the same question. Twain made the same answer. Irving then got almost to the climax of the tale before breaking off again: “Are you quite sure you haven’t heard this?” The third time was too much for the listener. “I can lie twice for courtesy’s sake, but I draw the line there. I can’t lie the third time at any price. I not only heard the story, I invented it.”2 Twain would have been happy to let the awkward irony pass without a word of the actual truth. Did it really matter to him that it was his story all along? No. He was happy to have the story play well for the good of the conversation. While Twain gave in at the end—and who could blame him?—the funny story illustrates that it doesn’t matter who gets the credit for a thing so long as that thing benefits all the parties involved. Inherent in the principle of surrendering the credit to someone else is this word we’ve already used: “reciprocity.” We don’t give in order to get in a transactional sense. But we do give in order to foster relationships—and by doing so we know there will be rewards. Reciprocity is a natural by-product of a relationship where two people share in joys and pains. “Double the joy, half the sorrow,” goes the saying. In true relationships friends look for ways to repay friends. What would happen if this spirit of relating spread throughout a company or a particular niche in the marketplace, or even across an entire value chain? Two things are certain: (1) everyone involved would enjoy life a lot more, and (2) success would be more probable as collaboration occurred naturally. We have more power to spread this spirit of relating today than ever. In the long run, no one but the originator remembers things such as whose idea it was, who spoke first, or who took the first risk. What people remember is magnanimity. It is an interesting paradox that the more you surrender the credit for something you’ve done, the more memorable you become, and the more you actually end up receiving credit. President Ronald Reagan was once quoted as saying, “What I would really like to do is to go down in history as the president who made Americans believe in themselves again.” From this quote alone we can establish a fairly accurate character analysis of the man. He was in the game so that others could win. His political goals centered on the uplifting and success of those he served in the office of president. Perhaps what best typifies Reagan is the quote on the plaque that sat above his Oval Office desk. It read: “There is no limit to what a man can do, or where he can go, if he doesn’t mind who gets the credit.”3 So often this is the case for influential people. They pursue a higher calling, something that transcends whatever political, bureaucratic, or success-oriented motivations stifle others. Reagan dismissed comments about his legacy with the quip that he wouldn’t be around to hear what the scholars and historians would say of him. This is what endeared him to so many as a person and leader. He lived and led with a constant surrender to the greater good of a country and did so with starkly unconventional methods. This is the mark of a person who seeks to elevate others despite himself. It is the unconventional mind that understands success isn’t about attention and accolades. It’s about partnerships and progress.   7Engage with Empathy We already discussed the debacle surrounding Armando Galarraga’s almost-perfect game, destroyed by a gross umpire error on what should have been the final play. When you look at the replay you see that Galarraga’s face slips from elation to disbelief in seconds. The cheers of the crowd are interrupted by an eerie silence. Then loud boos and profanity ensue. Galarraga was needlessly robbed of what is considered the holy grail of pitching accomplishments. This is all the more maddening when you consider that the pitcher was not a superstar expected to reach such heights. He was an average journeyman who had accumulated an equal amount of wins and losses. This was perhaps his one shot at pitching prominence, and it had been spoiled. Who would blame him for lashing out at the umpire—crying out for justice? Even Joyce himself, after the game, said that if he were the pitcher, he would have been fast and fierce in the umpire’s face. But there is yet another side—a third dimension—to the story. More memorable than Galarraga’s tainted perfection or Jim Joyce’s subsequent contrition was the pitcher’s response to the pilfering of his prize. His handling of the injustice engaged the entire world. In an ESPN interview following the game Galarraga admitted he did not know what the call was going to be. He was just concentrating on catching the ball and getting the out. He admitted he was disappointed but conceded that the runner might have been safe. He was both nervous and excited. The intensity of the situation meant that he had to rely on the calm judgment of the umpire. After the game, however, Galarraga viewed the replay and knew that a perfect game had just been taken from him. Yet somehow, when he spoke to the umpire he was able to say, “I know nobody is perfect.” He saw Joyce’s contrition and knew he had a choice: beat him down further or see things from his perspective. The consideration compelled Galarraga to offer a hug to Joyce to make him feel okay. This was no camera-ready compassion. Galarraga was sincerely disappointed and sincerely empathetic. Throughout the postgame interview he consistently responded to questions and the situation with the utmost nobility. He did not attempt to paint the umpire as a villain. He displayed humility and perspective, the progenitors of empathy. In an age bent on self-promotion and interpersonal leverage, we seldom take the time to consider how someone else might feel in any given situation. No one in the sports world would have faulted Galarraga for ripping the umpire on national television. Who would have whispered a word if the pitcher had used a featured interview as a platform to demolish Joyce’s reputation? Yet Galarraga did nothing of the sort. His comments centered on how the umpire must have felt or what he must be feeling and the acknowledgment that nobody is perfect. We marvel at this kind of reaction because it is so uncommon. Yet an intriguing and noteworthy point is that the young pitcher cemented a more memorable place in sports history for his response to losing the perfect game than he would have if he had achieved pitching perfection. Those who can find a way to engage others in a manner worthy of such distinction are on the path of significant influence. When dealing with a person, always ask yourself, “How would I feel, how would I react, if I were in his shoes?” “Cooperativeness in conversation,” wrote Gerald S. Nirenberg, “is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.”1 We frequently hear critiques of the world’s leaders. It is easy, as the saying goes, to sit in the stands and solve everyone else’s problems. What we rarely witness are people who say, “I can’t imagine the pressure you must be under to have the weight of an entire country on your shoulders. I can’t imagine how much you must lie awake at night thinking through whether you made the right decision or said the right thing on national television.” Once you take the time to consider the other person’s perspective, you will become sympathetic to his feelings and ideas. You will be able to authentically and honestly say, “I don’t blame you for feeling as you do. If I were in your position, I would feel just as you do.” This phrase, so rare in discourse today, will stop people in their tracks, will immediately get their attention, and will make them far more amenable to your ideas. Most people are merely looking for somebody who will listen to them and be sympathetic with their plight, regardless of how large or small their woes. If you can do that for another, you are giving her a gift that will brighten her day, even her week or month. One man took a Dale Carnegie course years ago and reported how the special, genuine interest of a nurse profoundly impacted his life. Martin Ginsberg grew up poor, without a father and with a mother on welfare. One Thanksgiving day he waited alone in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. His mother had to work and couldn’t be there for him; loneliness was crushing him. He pulled the covers and pillow over his head and wept. Just then a young student nurse poked her head in, heard him sobbing, sat on his bed, pulled the covers and pillow off him, and wiped away his tears. She told him how lonely she was too. She had to work all day and couldn’t be with her family. Then she asked young Martin whether he would have dinner with her. He agreed. So she went to the cafeteria and returned with two trays of Thanksgiving dinner. They talked and talked, and while she was supposed to get off work at 4:00 p.m., she stayed until 11:00 p.m., when he fell asleep. “Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since then,” Ginsberg writes, “but not one ever passes without me remembering that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness, and the warmth and tenderness of a stranger that somehow made it all bearable.” Today there’s little excuse for misunderstanding or overlooking another’s perspective. Most of us are broadcasting the details of our lives, seeking significance or a sympathetic ear from anyone who will listen. By taking time to research other people’s current circumstances you will avoid making assumptions about them. If a person is important to you in some way, every second you spend trying to better understand his perspective is a second well spent. We are not empathetic creatures naturally, so we must work at it. Many elements can factor in to how we respond in certain situations: our upbringing, our faith persuasion, our economic status, or our current career status. These and more mix with our emotions to produce a mode of personal engagement with others. Yet when we take the very things that personally move us and allow them to paint our perceptions of others, we move to a more influential place where our words can have significant impact. We would all grow in stature and confidence if we could learn how to celebrate the most common thread in everyone. Imagine the personal barriers you could bridge in your workplace, your home, or your friendships if you could always respond to mistakes and disputes in a gracious manner. What sort of treatment would you receive back? What sort of perception would others have of you? Remember, empathy is not a networking tactic to be learned and leveraged; it is a link to immediate affluence in human relations. It is Galarraga giving up his right to berate Jim Joyce and burning his name into the heart of every sports fan the world over. This is the undeniable power of a gracious, understanding approach.   8Appeal to Noble Motives We all crave transcendence—to be part of something bigger than ourselves, to be meaningful to the world and the people within it, to have it said of us that we rose above, took a stand, reached beyond, and did what was right and honorable and true. Small boys long to be the strong warrior or the heroic prince of an imaginary kingdom. Small girls long to be the clever maiden or the captivating princess at the center of a grand adventure. At a foundational level, these same desires are a reason you hold this book in your hands. While relational improvement and business productivity are centerpieces of our lives, their importance exists because we long to be people who make a difference. Tapping this noble motive in those you’d like to influence can therefore reap great rewards. And it is likely simpler than you think. When the British newspaper and publishing magnate Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him that he didn’t want published, he wrote the editor a letter. He didn’t say, “Please do not publish that picture of me anymore; I don’t like it.” He appealed to a nobler motive: the respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He asked that the picture not be published simply because his mother did not like it. When John D. Rockefeller Jr., wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn’t say, “I don’t want their pictures published.” He appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming children. He said: “You know how it is, boys. You’ve got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.” Such an approach does more than just appeal to a noble motive in another; it assigns to that person a certain nobility. It conveys the message, “You are capable of doing the right, honorable, true thing.” It is a subtle compliment that essentially says, “I believe in you.” These are powerful words that move people to action, as a Dale Carnegie Training graduate named Sarah learned. She and a friend were arranging a trip to Austria and Germany for a group of ten. They contacted a coach company to arrange a transfer from Austria to Europa Park in Rust, Germany. They received a quote of 965 euros for the transfer, which they agreed to and confirmed via email. One week before the transfer, Sarah received an email from Peter, an associate in the coach company, asking her which Rust she was planning to visit with the group. Peter told Sarah that if they were visiting the Rust in Austria it would cost 965 euros, but if it was the Rust in Germany it would cost 1,889 euros. Naturally, Sarah was angry about the sudden change in price. She knew there was little time to arrange for another transfer at a reasonable cost. She was faced with a dilemma. Should she begin sending an angry litany of emails to Peter regarding how he changed his offer? Or was there another way to handle the problem? Sarah determined that berating Peter would accomplish little and would still leave her stuck with the transfer problem. So she decided on a different approach. She would appeal to Peter’s noble motives and attempt to fix the problem through honest interaction. She acted calmly. She replied to his email by asking him if there were two different Europa Parks in two different cities called Rust. Peter replied in the negative. Sarah replied with another email, including a copy of his initial offer, and explained that she had clearly specified that the transfer was for Europa Park, Rust, Germany, and that, based on his reply, there was only one. She then concluded, “I kindly request an explanation for this change of pricing, as I am sure as a respectful company, you value your initial offers, and care about maintaining your credibility with your clients.” Sarah received an apology from Peter the next day, explaining that there had been some confusion on their end. He then gladly confirmed the initial offer. By appealing to Peter’s and his company’s nobler motives, Sarah was able to solve the problem without further financial or emotional cost. Most of us do not recognize these noble desires in ourselves while we are children, but when we grow up we see them in our children and feel them well up inside of us when we watch films such as The King’s Speech, Gladiator, or Little Women. In some way we all want our everydayness to include heroic elements. “What if ?” writes author and former marriage and family counselor John Eldredge, “What if those deep desires in our hearts are telling us the truth, revealing to us the life that we were meant to live.”1 Few would refute that there is something noble and redeemable in everyone. All of us, being idealists at heart and preferring to present ourselves in the best light, like to think of motives that sound good. If we provide an opportunity for others to do the same, if we don’t assume that their motives are selfish or deceitful, we allow them to increase their own self-worth in their response to us. We allow them to prove us right about them. Today’s advertisers are exceptionally good at applying this principle. Consider the campaigns for environmentally friendly products, Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty, and other products that make either the buyer or the company seem nobler in motive. Nonprofit organizations also employ this tactic and use social media to propagate their messages in these ways. This works because most people will react favorably to your proposals if they feel that you admire them for being honest, unselfish, and fair. One morning at breakfast, University of San Francisco business professor David Batstone learned that one of his favorite restaurants in the Bay Area was using slave labor. The newspaper article that exposed the atrocity detailed how the restaurant forced employees to work under harsh conditions by threatening to expose their status as illegal immigrants. The story caught David off-guard and ignited a passion within him to start the Not for Sale Campaign, an organization that seeks, among other things, to expose modern-day slave labor in communities and companies across America. To hear David speak about the campaign is to be compelled to join in. This is precisely what he wants to see happen. He knows the issue will touch everyone. The thought of slave labor in this day and age is appalling—it makes us indignant and ready to rise up to help. In 2010 David and his team rolled out a new initiative called Free2Work. The program is actually an app for your smartphone. The consumer scans a product, and the app then produces a grade for the company that makes the product. If, for example, you want to buy a shirt from Patagonia, you can scan the item and the Free2Work app will give Patagonia a manufacturing grade indicating how well the company performs with regard to fair trade, employment, and overseas manufacturing. The app provides a new level of accountability for manufacturing companies and a new level of responsibility for consumers. We can’t claim ignorance anymore for supporting companies that employ slave labor or fail to be transparent in their international manufacturing efforts. On a deeper level, the app speaks directly to the noble motives of the companies involved. When held accountable for their business dealings and asked to meet a high and humane standard, companies tend to comply. They understand that consumers increasingly care about how products are made and how their companies treat the people they employ. The Free2Work Campaign targets the noble motives of consumers and manufacturing companies to incite positive cultural change. How can you begin targeting the noble desires of your constituents and vendors in a way that will contribute to changing the ethos of a particular industry that may need new life, new standards? This is an important question to answer today. The key to successful growth and positive impact inside and outside the marketplace is what digital maven Amy Martin calls “the business of humanity.” Her response to the 2011 tsunami in Japan exemplifies the power of appealing to noble motives in the digital age.2 It also serves as a candid reminder of the consequences of not embodying this principle. During a late-night workout on an elliptical machine, Martin was perusing others’ Twitter updates on her iPad. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit in Japan, and suddenly the Twittersphere was inundated with the news. She flipped to CNN on the television and caught live footage of vehicles being washed away and people frantically trying to outrun the crushing tide coming ashore. “I wasn’t sure what to do,” she blogged, “but I felt accountable and compelled to help in some way.” She began sifting through the most relevant tweets and links and redistributing them to her large following. She also asked her followers to send her any valuable information they had that she could broadcast to others. For four hours she continued, and none of it had anything to do with marketing or promoting products. It was about “people coming together through a virtual medium to help each other,” she wrote. “It was the business of humanity.” Still, during her humanitarian efforts she witnessed an alarming contrast—large television news outlets seemingly crippled by an ill-timed concern for ratings. While she was in the midst of the digital effort, certain prominent news channels toggled back and forth between dramatic footage of the catastrophe and the latest celebrity spectacle. “I was aghast,” she wrote. “In my opinion, if these news organizations are in the least concerned about the way the public perceives their brand then they should exercise more discernment and care more about saving lives than the Hollywood beat. . . . Sometimes you need to put [Hollywood] in the backseat and focus on the right thing to do.” Martin clarifies something that is easy to forget amid the push to transactional effect. The many social media channels to which we are privy are first and foremost interpersonal communication tools designed for humans to connect. “They weren’t invented,” she notes,“for marketers.” Many of Martin’s followers echoed the sentiment in her blog post and appreciated her appeal to the noble motives not only in the large news organizations but also in all who had the capacity to help those suffering in the wake of the tsunami. While Martin was selling nothing that night, it is no wonder 1.3 million people follow her on Twitter and some of the most prominent businesses, celebrities, and professional sports teams call on her for digital guidance. She is one who knows that doing business in the digital age is predicated on doing the business of humanity well. So often we are content to simply plug others into our digital world and browse them like commodities until we are ready to engage in some sort of transaction. Such sentiment removes the nobility inherent in our shared humanity. It makes our relationships merely tools of transaction rather than transcendence. To truly connect with people you must celebrate their inherent dignity. In doing so you celebrate yours. Appeal to noble motives and you can move the masses, and yourself along with them.   9Share Your Journey Peddling ice to Inuits? Selling seawater to a dolphin? Compelling consumers to wear cotton? Today the last of those doesn’t seem like a stretch. Examine the threads of every clothing item you own and chances are high many if not most of them are cotton. But in the 1970s that was probably not the case. Polyester and its synthetic cousins were the rage. They didn’t wrinkle, they resisted stains, and they were formfitting—and as a result, cotton’s market share dwindled to about 33 percent.1 The industry decided to fight back. It needed to make cotton desirable again, so it did what any industry would do: it started a trade association, hired ad firms, and rebranded cotton. The slogan they settled on to save their industry? “Cotton: The fabric of our lives.” They had celebrities pitch the slogan. Barbara Walters famously donned a Hawaiian shirt, looked into the camera, and said, “Cotton . . . it’s making my life comfortable today.”2 When the cotton industry was on the line, its members made the strategic decision that the best way to get people to buy their threads was by threading cotton into a personal story. Cotton wasn’t a soft, white, fluffy fiber that was spun into threads that became fabric that became garments; cotton gave life meaning by tying it together into a beautiful story. Today cotton commands about two-thirds of the market.3 People don’t want to be treated as commodities, but more than that, they don’t want to see their lives as ordinary. People want to know that they matter, and the best way to show them that they do is by allowing them to connect with a larger story. People and businesses that understand this principle are unbeatable. In 2011, Apple topped Fortune’s survey of business people as the world’s most admired company for the fourth year in a row.4 Part of the company’s secret is found in one of the most famous TV ads in history. In 1984, during the Super Bowl, Apple unveiled its Macintosh personal computer for the first time. The ad was aimed at distinguishing the radically new and creativity-encouraging Mac from the conformity of the masses (to Apple, that was IBM). In the ad an athletic young woman carrying a large hammer runs into a room of look-alike, dress-alike pseudo-people. She throws the hammer at a great screen and destroys an Orwellian Big Brother–type figure. It is the dawning of a new day. Treating people as mere Social Security numbers with arms and legs is over. One-on-one business was the wave of the future. The proof of this concept isn’t found just in Apple’s success; it is also found in some simple shoes. Blake Mycoskie started TOMS shoes after a story disrupted his life. He was traveling in the developing world when he noticed a simple problem: the kids he saw had no shoes. No shoes meant a lot of other nos in their stories . . . a lot of deprivation. So Blake decided to start a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes for a child in need. The first year he had the pleasure of giving away ten thousand shoes. Today that number is over one million. But that’s not where the story ends. One afternoon in an airport waiting area Mycoskie noticed a girl wearing a red pair of his shoes. Without revealing his identity, he asked about them. The girl told him the whole story behind TOMS in such detail that it rivaled his own description of the company. It was a moment that made him realize, “The truth is, what’s inside this box is not nearly as important as what it represents. TOMS is no longer a shoe company; it’s a one-for-one company.” “In addition to attracting the interest of mainstream media starting with Vogue, Time and People magazine, TOMS Shoes attracted prestigious partners,” explains power blogger Valeria Maltoni. “Ralph Lauren, who had not partnered with anyone for 40 years, joined in with TOMS Shoes for the rugby brand. The ad agency working with AT&T created a commercial to tell the ‘authentic story’ of how Blake used their network to stay in touch and work on the go.” Maltoni concludes her thoughts on the success of TOMS with an insightful nod to the power of this principle: “People remember. And when a message is a mission, they will tell your story to anyone who will hear it—even a stranger at an airport. And by doing that, they become your strongest advocates in marketing your product. . . . The lesson: influence is given.”5 While larger stories can be inviting, the land of small, personal stories can be intimidating. It is one thing to reveal a cause, cure, or commodity. It is another thing entirely to reveal yourself. In April 2003, author David Kuo was driving home from a party with his wife. He woke up in the ER, told he had a brain tumor likely to kill him in a matter of months. At three o’clock on that Palm Sunday morning, David and his wife, Kim, faced a decision: How much of their story did they want people to know? How willing were they to share it? The tendency was to remain private. But they resisted that impulse, and Kim started calling friends, telling them the story and telling them to tell others so that they could pray. Within hours a page for them was set up on CaringBridge.org, a nonprofit site where people facing serious illness can post updates, needs, and anything else that they would like. In the weeks and months that followed, the Kuos decided that the more information they could share, the more people they could help—they knew they were hardly alone in their cancer battle. That decision was life-changing for them. They saw their story as part of something far larger than them. It eventually provided a type of opportunity for them with other people facing similar challenges. Their first bit of advice for everyone? Share your story. That’s something Ann M. Baker from Seattle, Washington, learned in a Dale Carnegie Training course: Most people treasure their privacy, as I do. However, when faced with breast cancer, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments, I did not want to share the worry and the pain.But when my cancer news slipped out among family, friends, and coworkers, I was overwhelmed with email encouragement. Even family acquaintances whom I had never met emailed their breast cancer stories, including phone numbers and follow-on get-well cards. This amazing outpouring of courage and love started a recovery journey that has changed my life. . . . And thanks to email, I know that no one needs or wants to journey the cancer road alone. For life is not about me. It is about us. There’s nothing wrong if something that is “about us” is also “good for me.” One digital media blogger with more than a million followers put out the word that she was going to have Lasik surgery to correct her eyesight. Not only was she going to have the surgery, she was going to stream it live on her blog for all who were interested in having the surgery themselves. Transparency became her currency. She not only got 20/15 vision, she got better insight into a whole new way of using the digital world to share our personal journeys with others. She cites the live stream of a friend’s recent wedding or a client’s use of live streaming video to watch his son’s football games when he’s away on business as good examples. “Aside from sports, entertainment and marketing, what else can live video be used for?” she asks. “Will it be adopted as a new communication channel used for functional benefit? . . . What about weddings, graduations, club meetings, religious ceremonies, birthdays, coaching, instructional content, cooking classes, births or even funerals? The opportunities are endless if they are embraced.”6 People trudge through most days with little excitement in their lives. But our digital age provides so many opportunities to give people an authentic view of who you are or what your company strives to be, thus creating touch points of commonality that draw you into closer friendship with others. It is easy to make a video instead of presenting a few drawings. It is easy to create a dynamic website to support a new company or organization. It is easy to use video conferencing instead of a call and to show a compelling presentation to all involved instead of simply telling them. But people have come to expect these things, too. To really make your idea pop, take a unique approach. Step beyond the bounds of your computer and do something people don’t see every day. Use all of the tools available to you and your imagination to make your ideas vivid, interesting, and dramatic. Share your stories, and others will be willing to share theirs. Together you will create a new and larger story. More and more common—and commonly effective at building influential relationships—is the authentic intersection of personal and professional life. While this intersection will always have certain judicious boundaries, many of the historically businesslike boundaries have been lowered or removed altogether today because most people have come to remember that the short- and long-term success of all interactions—transactional or otherwise—rides on the depth of the relationship. The more a colleague, friend, or customer shares of your journey, the more you can accomplish together. When your journey is our journey, we are both compelled to see where it goes.   10Throw Down a Challenge When it comes to discussions about the best players in NBA history, two names usually come up: Larry and Magic. Larry Bird and Earvin “Magic” Johnson were, individually, two of the most compelling players to ever grace the hardwood courts—gifted passers who possessed almost otherworldly senses of players and positions on the basketball court. They were virtually unrivaled in clutch situations. They prided themselves for their defense as much as for their offense, and they worked harder than any of their teammates. And they defined basketball for a decade. Magic beat Larry in the 1979 NCAA championship, then beat him again in the 1984 NBA Championship. Larry beat Magic in 1985 and then lost to him again in 1987. For most of their careers they didn’t much like each other, but their respect for each other knew no bounds. Then in 1991, Magic was unexpectedly forced to retire from professional basketball because he contracted HIV. The day after Magic’s announcement, Bird found himself preparing for a regular-season game. He stretched his back, loosened up by jogging through the corridors of the arena, shot baskets from his usual spots on the floor . . . and for the first time in his life he had no desire to play. His competitor, who by then had become his friend, was gone from the sport. Magic had played a major role in making Bird who he was. A few months later, at his retirement ceremony, Magic said, “I want to thank Larry Bird personally for bringing out the best in Magic Johnson because, without you, I could have never risen to the top.”1 Some people seem to think that competition is a dirty word. It isn’t. Competition is one of the most compelling realities of the natural world. While connection is necessary to keep us thriving, competition is necessary to keep us striving. “As iron sharpens iron,” wrote King Solomon, Israel’s third monarch, “so one man sharpens another.”2 The sound of iron sharpening iron is about as subtle as the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard. But King Solomon recognized that the only way to get the best out of yourself and others is to challenge and collide. While a life of permanent interpersonal pleasantries appears more comfortable and sounds more peaceful, a relationally complacent life is a fruitless life. A challenge doesn’t have to involve blood, sweat, and tears. Coke issued a challenge to consumers in a 2010 social media ad campaign—they challenged people not to smile. Coke set up a special vending machine on a real college campus. This machine didn’t just dispense soft drinks. It surprised students with everything from free bottles of Coke to a bouquet of flowers, a pizza, and a six-foot sub.3 The cameras caught it all, and the results were streamed to YouTube. The sheer joy and surprise of the students receiving the gifts—some high-fiving, others hugging, all smiling and laughing—also put smiles on the faces of the nearly four million viewers who watched it online. The challenge to viewers was not to smile, and it garnered millions of willing failures, just as Coke had hoped for. One of the things that drove the early, wild days of the Internet was the passionate competition between Microsoft and AOL. Easily forgotten in this era of Apple and Google, the AOL/Microsoft battle accelerated the availability of cutting-edge services for the customer. Each company envisioned the day when consumers would perform the majority of their transactions online, get most of their information online, and live a big chunk of their lives online. The companies loathed each other, and their cultures were vastly different—one was a consumer-oriented marketing company that happened to use technology and the other was a technology company that happened to use consumer marketing.4 AOL testified against Microsoft in the antitrust trial against the giant software company. And yet that competition made both companies larger and more successful than either would have been without the other. Yes, everyone faces challenges in their lives, and people commonly say it doesn’t matter what the challenge is; what matters is how one responds to it. True enough. Some people get injured or sick or hurt and give up. They put themselves on the conveyor belt to the grave. Others rise to great heights. Take Teddy Roosevelt, for example. A sickly child, young Teddy had life-threatening asthma. Oftentimes he struggled to breathe, and the asthma weakened his heart. Then, when he was twelve, his father put down a challenge: “Theodore, you have the mind but you have not the body, and without the help of the body the mind cannot go as far as it should. You must make your body. It’s hard drudgery to make one’s body, but I know you will do it.”5 In response, the boy half grinned and half snarled—the first reported instance of the look that would become known the world over. He then jerked his head back and replied through clenched teeth, “I’ll make my body.”6 Over the next year his life consisted of strenuous exercise. And as his strength grew, so did his boldness and daring. He plunged into icy rivers and climbed seven mountains, including one of them twice in a single day. And as he did these things his obsession with nature began. Everything from birds to moss fascinated him, and he collected several hundred specimens for preservation in the “Roosevelt Museum of Natural History.”7 Without his father’s challenge, what might have become of such a sickly boy? The challenge changed him forever. It is also true, however, that the challenge itself is just as important as the response to it. Challenges that inspire and compel are very different from challenges that discourage and depress. In 2010, Shaun King, pastor of Courageous Church in Atlanta, wanted to raise money for a permanent home for disabled Haitian orphans. But how to do it? This was the first challenge. In the digital age, creativity in such matters is greatly expanded. He wanted to reach the biggest audience possible with the message. He came up with the idea for a celebrity charity auction with a twist. People wouldn’t be bidding for a picture, an autograph, or a date. They’d bid for a celebrity to follow them on Twitter and retweet their posts. He approached Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria Parker with the challenge. She jumped in and then challenged her celebrity buddies to become part of it as well. They did, and TwitChange was born.8 In 2010, more than 175 celebrities with a combined ninety million followers garnered thirty million hits and raised more than $500,000.9 That’s the power of a meaningful challenge in an age where our reach is long and influence expansive. There are pernicious half-truths in the world, but few are as disturbing as “Go along to get along.” That isn’t a way to live a life, raise a family, or run a business. People don’t want to be leveled down; they want to be leveled up. They want their vision raised, and sometimes that means throwing down a challenge. Charles Schwab once said, “The way to get things done is to stimulate competition.” When we compete, we are striving to win because winning generates a feeling of success and importance. When victory is defined as team victory—for a cause, a country, a cure, or a company—winning is all the more compelling, because the competition forces us to communicate and connect on an area of affinity. The competition comes to mean as much to us for its camaraderie as for its ultimate result. Look around your sphere of influence for an area of affinity that can generate a competition that can mean something more than reaching the finish line—something that can mean lasting friendships and corporate influence for positive change. If it’s one person you’d like to help change, throw down a compelling challenge that gets you both involved in the arena. Nobody said challenges were clean endeavors. Get dirty for the sake of others, and they will get dirty for you.   Part 4How to Lead Change Without Resistance or Resentment   1Begin on a Positive Note In his classic book Leadership Is an Art, author Max DePree famously asserted, “The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant.”1 A tendency is to take the assertion to mean we must bear down and get the ugly stuff said first, as though it were to the leader’s advantage to get the bad news out of the way. But this is not the case, especially in a day and age when bad news travels at the speed of light. While a current relationship, whether between a company and its customers or between two individuals, might be strained or even in serious trouble, it does little good to start off a conversation on a negative note. Like a play whose first act features a tragedy, it sets a gloomy and unpleasant stage. Shoulders sag, faces fall, and hearts begin to sink inside the recipients. Imagine this effect spread viruslike throughout the ranks of an organization or across a company’s entire value chain or across an entire country. You will be forced to work against a wave of negative psychological and physiological reactions from the start, and even if you can overcome them quickly, there’s no need to spend the little time you may have trying to undo something that could have been avoided in the first place. Instead, begin a conversation with honest and genuine appreciation; the receiver will be more amenable to your ideas and less defensive or resistant. Many of us have experienced that defensiveness and resistance when dealing with customer service agents—amazingly enough! But Sanjiv Ekbote, who had recently read How to Win Friends and Influence People, knew how to handle a difficult situation.2 He had recently purchased a house with a home warranty. One evening the bathroom faucet began to leak, so he called the warranty company. And within four hours, a young technician arrived to fix the problem. First he replaced the valve, but the water began flowing faster. So the technician capped the pipe, but the water pressure broke seals and water began leaking inside the walls. Sanjiv was upset and immediately called the warranty company to ask them to send a more experienced technician. He could have ranted and raved at the person who answered the phone, but instead he paused. He calmly provided his information, and then he thanked the representative for sending out a technician so quickly. He explained what had happened, and the woman tracked down an expert technician, scheduled the earliest appointment possible, and waived the service fee. If Sanjiv had reacted differently, would he have received the same service? This seems like a rather simple technique, yet it is deceptively difficult to practice. Let’s consider DePree’s mandate for leaders to understand why. At the heart of our misinterpretation of his statement is the connotation that the term “reality” carries in our daily discourse. Why is it that we have to “face reality,” deliver “a dose of reality” that is reluctantly swallowed like foul medicine, bring someone “back to reality” from an idyllic dreamland that doesn’t jibe with the hard-nosed facts? This is the mind-set from which we often approach crucial conversations. Is reality actually a bitter pill, or at least an overly pragmatic one? Probably not, but we may be hardwired to see it that way, particularly when something is nagging at us. Our hunter-gatherer ancestry still dictates that we pay particular attention to the most dramatic unfolding around us, and usually these are negative ones. Our survival depends on this ability—or it once did, anyway. Neuroscientists, in a variety of studies, have shown that “we care more about the threat of bad things than we do about the prospect of good things. Our negative brain tripwires are far more sensitive than our positive triggers,” wrote Ray Williams, a leadership coach.3 We even remember negative events better, or at least our memories are skewed toward them. Unfortunately, research has shown that this effect isn’t limited to events but extends to the impressions we form of other people. We may weigh those traits or behaviors we deem to be negative more heavily than the positive, particularly if they are moral or ethical in nature.4 At those times when we hope most strongly to encourage change in others, we are often frustrated with current conduct. Our brains are preoccupied with the negative behavior. It shapes our perception of reality. It crowds out the positive. And so it is no surprise that in our communications we can’t seem to help jumping into the problem—or, from our listeners’ perspectives, the criticism. Our listeners’ brains are just like ours. The negative or critical in what we say becomes their point of obsession. It drowns out all possibility of discovering the positive opportunities within the conversation. I’m sure you’ve seen it happen: faces grow tight, expressions become studiously blank, and only the eyes may reveal the inner rant of protest that is blocking out anything else you might have to say. If we don’t work hard to avoid this drama, we shoot ourselves in the leadership foot. In a classic study on how negative and positive feedback affect performance, J. Sidney Shrauger and Saul Rosenberg discovered, quite simply, that our performance suffers when we receive feedback that we have failed in some way.5 Now, if we are confident and have strong self-esteem, the effect is less severe. However, a secondary reaction to criticism is to discount the validity of the feedback—we reject it outright, so it has little effect on our behavior except to sully our attitude. Why take the risk? Why not mitigate these effects on performance or attitude right from the start? In an article on leadership skills for teachers, Trent Lorcher explained how, as a basketball coach, he had handled a disappointing loss with his team. “We lost an important game on account of several missed free throws. My natural reaction was to yell at my team. Instead, I praised them for being aggressive and getting to the free throw line consistently. We then practiced free throws for the next hour. My players, already upset by the loss, responded well to praise.”6 In his latest book, Good Boss, Bad Boss, Robert Sutton, an organizational psychologist, relates a story sent to him by a former U.S. Army officer. Most of the man’s superior officers were jerks—nasty, belittling, and mean-spirited. But his battalion commander was different. I got out of a line a few times and he brought me in immediately and counseled me on my behavior. He didn’t yell or belittle me, but I got the point and was embarrassed that I had let him down. I’m a better person for it and I’d like to think that I have picked up his habits and that I emulate his actions by treating people the way they should be treated.7 We can overcome our baser instincts by acknowledging our inherent tendencies and working to focus our attention on the positive. It’s not just positive thinking; it’s rewiring our brains to recognize that our perceptions are not necessarily in line with truth, stopping to analyze our underlying assumptions about a situation, and questioning those assumptions until we get to a fuller picture. We can train our mirror-neuron systems—those cells discovered in recent decades that enable us to understand the actions of others, to interpret their intentions, and to predict what they might do next—to include positive behaviors and what they reveal about the people we coach. And that is essential if we want to be authentic in our appreciation. We need to find a truthful positive point to begin from, and we need to show appreciation that resonates with the receiver. The best bosses, according to Robert Sutton, take the time to discover how each member of their teams think and act. It isn’t easy. Leaders, despite their best efforts, are often naturally removed from situations that may be the most revealing about individual personal dynamics. But making the effort is worth the payout in terms of influence and effectiveness as a leader. When we acknowledge the value a person has to our organization, we establish a positive tone for open communication. Of course, we must get around to the matter at hand eventually. Perhaps worse than attempting to get the bad news out of the way is attempting to soften it or simply not address it at all. This “Mum Effect”—a term coined by psychologists Sidney Rosen and Abraham Tesser in the early 1970s—happens because people want to avoid becoming the target of others’ negative emotions.8 We all have the opportunity to lead change, yet it often requires of us the courage to deliver bad news to our superiors. We don’t want to be the innocent messenger who falls before a firing line. When our survival instincts kick in, they can override our courage until the truth of a situation gets watered down into pabulum. “The Mum Effect and the resulting filtering can have devastating effects in a steep hierarchy,” writes Sutton. “What starts out as bad news becomes happier and happier as it travels up the ranks—because after each boss hears the news from his or her subordinates, he or she makes it sound a bit less bad before passing it up the chain.”9 Leading with the positive and resisting the urge to promote drama are tools that can help us bolster our resolve, techniques for stepping confidently into the breach. And leaders who model this behavior are less likely to be blindsided by catastrophes they should have known about all along. At Sonda, Andrés Navarro found a way to institutionalize this approach by adopting a three-for-one rule. “We try to criticize as little as we can. We have a rule. If you get into this company and you find someone whom you don’t like and you think doesn’t do his work the way he should, don’t say anything. Write it down on a piece of paper.” People are then required to discover at least three good things about the person before they can open a discussion designed to change the other’s behavior.10 How, then, do we engage in interactions in which undesirable topics must be discussed? We know intuitively it is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points. If the praise is contrived or if the segue from praise to criticism is too abrupt, then this principle will fail. To avoid this, consider the following. First, the praise you offer must be genuine and heartfelt, not just a tool to bide time while you compose your criticisms. Second, you must be able to create a smooth flow from point to point. Third, offer constructive advice rather than criticism following the praise. This style of communicating a point can be particularly difficult in written form. Without the natural flow of a conversation that presents opportunities to segue from one topic to the next, it may seem to the other person that you were just “buttering her up.” If the topic is particularly contentious, you should really have a face-to-face conversation. Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word “but,” which signals that the criticism is about to begin. This may make the listener question the sincerity of the praise. Use “and” instead, and provide constructive advice rather than criticism. This is possibly the most effective way to address an issue in written form without seeming false in your praise. Beginning with praise and appreciation will help you help employees be more productive, vendors be more committed, and friends and family be more inclined to see your point of view. A positive outlook always places interactions on a positive path.   2Acknowledge Your Baggage Beth was a high-level executive in a Fortune 100 company. While much loved by her bosses and her team, she was in the throes of battle with a colleague, Harvey, who headed up another division. All’s fair in love and war, right? Well, Beth was living by that motto, revealing her most vindictive side in their interactions. But Beth wanted to be a better leader, and so she enlisted the aid of Marshall Goldsmith, executive coach and author of What Got You Here Won’t Get You There. What she learned is that while she was respected by many, her behavior with Harvey was still affecting her reputation. She needed to negotiate a peace agreement with Harvey, and to do so, she had to admit fault. This might be one of the hardest situations in which to follow this approach—one in which you have to acknowledge your mistakes to the person those mistakes have harmed. Tensions on both sides are already high, competition may be a driving factor, and you may feel it isn’t safe to make yourself vulnerable. Yet these are also the situations that can be most effectively defused by talking about your own mistakes first. So what did Beth say? “You know, Harvey, I’ve got a lot of feedback here, and the first thing I want to say is that I’m positive about a lot of it. The next thing I want to say is that there are some things at which I want to be better. I’ve been disrespectful to you, the company, and the traditions in the company. Please accept my apologies. There is no excuse for this behavior.”1 Harvey’s response? He got tears in his eyes, admitted that he too had behaved dishonorably, and declared that together they would improve. A lengthy, embittered turf war ended simply by proclaiming the mistakes she had made. It isn’t nearly so difficult to be open to a conversation that may include a discussion of your faults if the other person begins by humbly admitting that she too is far from impeccable. Admitting one’s mistakes—even when one hasn’t corrected them—can help convince somebody to change his behavior. Carnegie, the ever-effective communicator, applied this same lesson when writing on it. He began the discussion with a story of how he had failed as a mentor and coach to help readers become open to the idea. It’s a subtle and masterly strategy—and proof that it can be effective in many forms. The difficulty that leaders face in implementing this strategy rests on one critical element: you must admit that you have made mistakes, that you are fallible. Leaders across the globe struggle with this, even though most understand inherently the value of it. And if they don’t understand it inherently, research certainly supports it. Researchers at the Institute for Health and Human Potential conducted a study of thirty-five thousand people on the factors in career advancement. The item found to be most linked to career advancement? Freely admitting to making mistakes.2 Admitting you have made a mistake is like the first step in a twelve-step program: it is both the hardest and the most important. Until we accept accountability, how can we learn from our mistakes, use them to propel us forward, and encourage others to trust us? “To leave the road of continual failure, a person must first utter the three most difficult words to say: ‘I was wrong.’ He has to open his eyes, admit his mistakes, and accept complete responsibility for his current wrong actions and attitudes.”3 Portia Nelson poetically describes this process in her “Autobiography in Five Short Chapters.” What begins in many of our first chapters as a pit of despair progresses only to detachment from the problem until we are able to accept responsibility for our faults. Once we see the link between where we are and what we do, only then do we begin to see quicker solutions to our problems; only then do we begin to walk around the deep holes in our path altogether. Eventually we learn we can simply walk down a less problematic path. That is to say, we move from merely being proficient problem solvers to behaving more proficiently.4 Aside from the personal gains of admitting our mistakes, the trust it builds with our colleagues and customers, our friends and families, and our community members is invaluable. Marshall Goldsmith writes, “No one expects us to be right all the time. But when we’re wrong, they certainly expect us to own up to it. In that sense, being wrong is an opportunity—an opportunity to show what kind of person and leader we are. . . . How well you own up to your mistakes makes a bigger impression than how you revel in your successes.”5 When we talk about our mistakes, it makes us human. It becomes easier for people to relate to us. They feel we understand their perspective better. And in this mental space, they are more open to our advice. What is lovely about this principle is that we all make mistakes and so have an ample supply of stories to use when trying to put someone at ease. Remember to follow the story with constructive advice, not straight-up criticism. How did Carnegie use the principle with his niece and new assistant, Josephine? By considering her lack of experience and his own blunders at her age and experience level. “You have made a mistake, Josephine,” he would begin, “but Lord knows, it’s no worse than many I have made. Judgment comes only with experience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so many silly things myself I have very little inclination to criticize you or anyone. But don’t you think it would have been wiser if you had done so-and-so?” By admitting your own mistakes, you direct the other person’s attention away from his own; you soften the approach and avoid raising his defenses immediately. When you acknowledge your baggage, trust builds naturally.   3Call Out Mistakes Quietly During the first days of his presidency, Coolidge and his family had not yet left their third-floor suite at the Willard Hotel in Washington. In the early morning hours the president awoke to see a cat burglar going through his clothes, removing a wallet and a watch chain. Coolidge spoke: “I wish you wouldn’t take that. . . . I don’t mean the watch and chain, only the charm. Read what is engraved on the back of it.” The burglar read: “Presented to Calvin Coolidge, Speaker of the House, by the Massachusetts General Court.” Coolidge then identified himself as the president, persuaded the burglar to relinquish the watch charm, led him into a quiet conversation, found out that the young man and his college roommate were unable to pay their hotel bill and buy train tickets back to their campus, counted out $32 from the wallet (which the dazed young man had also relinquished), declared it to be a loan, and advised the student that in order to avoid the Secret Service, he should leave as unconventionally as he had entered.1 Calling attention indirectly to someone’s mistakes or missteps works wonders with people who may resent any direct criticism—and that defines most people. Leaders of all kinds have a fantastic tool available to them for sending a subtle message about the behavior they are trying to encourage. They simply have to model that behavior themselves. And if they do not, the message to those around them will be loud and clear: “I tell you I want you to behave in such a way, but it’s not actually that important. Otherwise, I would do it myself.” This concept is John Maxwell’s thirteenth law of leadership in his classic The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. He calls it “The Law of the Picture” because people do what they see. He tells the story of platoon leader Dick Winters of Easy Company during World War II. Winters believed that it was an officer’s responsibility to go first, set an example, lead the charge, and take risks alongside his men. One of the most remarkable incidents demonstrating Winters’s way of leading by example occurred soon after D-Day on the road to Carentan, a town that Easy Company need to take from the Germans. As the American paratroopers under his command approached the town, they became pinned down by German machine-gun fire. Huddled in ditches on either side of the road, they wouldn’t move forward when ordered to. Yet if they didn’t move, they would eventually be cut to pieces. Winters tried rallying them. He coaxed them. He kicked them. He ran from one ditch to the other as machine-gun bullets flew by. Finally, he jumped into the middle of the road, bullets glancing off the ground near him, and shouted at the men to get moving. Everyone got up and moved forward as one. And they helped to take the town.2 At times it isn’t possible to influence others by modeling behavior, either because you aren’t with the people you are trying to influence or because you actually aren’t immersed in what it is that they are doing. How do we influence behavior then? The authors of Influencer offer some compelling advice for these situations: • Identify those in the group, team, family, or community who have the most influence over others and get them to model the behavior you want to promote. • Develop a community approach to the behavior by appealing to the broader good. Peer pressure goes a long way toward influencing the thoughts and actions of individuals. • Make any changes possible to the resources available or the environment to make the new behavior or mind-set easy to adopt.3 At the end of World War II, soldiers were returning from the front lines and reentering the workforce. In the process, they were displacing the women who had stepped up and filled many positions in their absence. Many women chose to remain in the workforce, which created animosity between the sexes in the workplace but also gave rise to a new view of the role women could play in the American economy. Restaurants around the country were facing a particular struggle. The returning soldiers were granted positions as cooks. The women who had held those positions were demoted to waitresses, positions of lower pay. The result: an antagonistic relationship between cooks and waitresses in an environment in which cooperation is a necessity. Everybody suffered, including the patrons, who often received late or wrong orders. Employees were quitting and restaurants were losing customers. So the National Restaurant Association enlisted the help of William Foote Whyte, a professor at the University of Chicago, to solve the problem. He observed the activity in a sample of restaurants, watching as cooks and waitresses slung insults, ignored each other, and behaved vindictively (at the expense of the customer). “While many consultants might have been tempted to alter this unhealthy social climate by teaching interpersonal skills, conducting team-building exercises, or changing the pay system, Whyte took a different approach,” explained the authors. “In his view, the best way to solve the problem was to change the way employees communicated.”4 Working with a pilot restaurant, Whyte recommended they use a simple metal spindle to place orders with the kitchen. The waitresses would put the orders on the spindle and the cooks would fulfill the orders in whatever way was most efficient, but making sure that those that were placed first were prioritized. The results were immediate: decreased conflict, decreased customer complaints, and communication and behavior that were more respectful on both sides. Sometimes the best way to correct behavior is not to openly punish the wrong behavior but to use the situation as a platform for building self-confidence and deeper connection. Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was flying back to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. At three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane and save himself and two others on board. But it was badly damaged. Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline. Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well. You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for such carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize his gross negligence. Instead, he threw his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.” In life, sometimes mistakes are the by-product of extenuating circumstances. We don’t always fail at work because of incompetence. We can fail because our hearts and minds are not engaged due to problems at home or elsewhere. The leader understands that mistakes and failures surface from all corners of life and, therefore, should be treated as isolated and redeemable instances rather than fatal flaws. In an age where emerging leaders are skeptical of inauthentic leadership tactics, it is best to confront mistakes honestly while not using them as opportunities for condemnation. To many, passive-aggressive approaches or manipulative encounters with leaders diminish their view of that particular leader and make them cynical about their contribution to the task at hand or even the organization they serve. It is to your advantage to pull people out of their dejected state as quickly as possibly. Do so by calling out their mistakes quietly and returning them to a place of confidence and strength.   4Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders In the military, orders are a part of everyday operations. You receive orders and you are expected to follow them to a T. But when Captain D. Michael Abrashoff took command of the USS Benfold, a guided missile destroyer, he knew he was facing a challenge that would require a different approach. The Benfold was not the top ship in the navy, not by far. The crew was sullen, morale was low, and most of the sailors on the ship were just biding their time until their discharge date. To add complexity to an already difficult leadership situation, the previous commander had not been well loved, so the crew was assessing their new leader with a harsh and critical eye. But this was Captain Abrashoff’s first sea command, and he was determined to do it well. His first step: learn about his crew. “It didn’t take me long to realize that my young crew was smart, talented, and full of good ideas that frequently came to nothing because no one in charge had ever listened to them,” wrote Captain Abrashoff in It’s Your Ship, his leadership chronicles of his time aboard the Benfold.1 So Captain Abrashoff vowed to listen to his crew, but not just when they decided to speak up. He knew that if he wanted to turn the ship around, the ideas for how to do that had to come from the crew. And what better way to find out what their ideas were than to interview them? Captain Abrashoff interviewed five crew members a day until he had interviewed every crew member on board—approximately 310 of them. What did he learn? That they wasted a lot of time on dreary chores, such as painting the ship six times a year. So Abrashoff found a way to replace all of the fasteners on the ship that caused rust streaks and a way to run many of the exterior panels through a special paint process. The ship didn’t have to be painted again for almost two years, freeing up time for more valuable endeavors, such as advanced training. He learned that many of them had signed up for the navy as a way to pay for college. So he arranged for SAT testing on the ship and long-distance advanced placement courses for the crew. He found that many of them came from rough backgrounds and had led tough lives but also were very attached to their families, so he included family members as much as possible in the sailors’ lives by sending birthday cards, letters of praise, and other important notes to parents and spouses. “I wanted to link our goals,” wrote Captain Abrashoff, “so that they would see my priority of improving Benfold as an opportunity for them to apply their talents and give their jobs a real purpose.” What was the result of asking questions of his crew? A serious shift in morale, a greater willingness to push the limits of what was possible, and some of the highest testing rankings the navy had ever seen. If Captain Abrashoff had stepped on board, issued a directive that the crew was to improve its rankings, and then outlined how that would happen, what might the result have been? We’ll never know, but it is unlikely that the Benfold would have become the ship—or the leadership catalyst—it became. Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable and reduces resentment, it often stimulates creativity and innovation in solving the problem at hand. People are more likely to follow a new path if they feel that they have been involved in shaping it. The familial leaders of the Marriott organization were known for their intense devotion to inspecting Marriott hotels to ensure that they were well run. Bill Marriot Jr., in particular, “was constantly on the go, asking questions and paying close attention to the responses,” writes Ed Fuller, the leader of Marriott International Lodging. In fact, sometimes he would be criticized for listening to too many people—and listening just as hard to frontline people as to senior executives. . . . His favorite question during his frontline visitations was, “What do you think?” It was his way of combating the tendency of employees to shy away from rocking the boat or passing on bad news to the boss.2 Bill Marriot Jr. was an enlightened leader who understood the negative power of the Mum Effect and how best to engage employees in making every Marriott property live up to his expectations. While we understand that asking questions increases the engagement of those we hope to influence, many leaders don’t take this route. Why? Because at times, asking questions can seem like a roundabout way to lead people to the answer you already have in your head. Why not just tell them? It would be more expedient. People don’t like to be ordered around, that’s why. Leaders are also reluctant to ask questions because they don’t know what responses might result. What if the other person doesn’t head in the direction you were intending? There is no way to overcome that possibility. Instead, leaders must think about it as an opportunity rather than as a risk. The answer you get may be better—likely will be better—than the one you already know. When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision machine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he was convinced that he could not meet the promised delivery date. The work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept the order. Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the order through, he called everybody together, explained the situation to them, and told them how much it would mean to the company and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time. Then he started asking questions: “Is there anything we can do to handle this order? Can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that will make it possible to take the order? Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that would help?” The employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the order. The order was accepted, produced, and delivered on time. While it should not be the case, many leaders dread doing performance reviews. They know they have employees who need improvement, and they foresee a battle as they deliver criticism and the employees become increasingly defensive and sullen. These leaders need to take a different tack. Most employees have a keen understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. While some may be obtuse, most, if you ask, will tell you exactly what you are thinking. Many organizational psychologists recommend instituting a self-appraisal stage in the review process. Studies have shown that self-appraisals lead to reviews that are more satisfying for managers and employees and have a greater positive effect on performance.3 Begin by giving the employee some questions to think about prior to the review: “What do you think you’re exceptionally good at? What are your goals for the coming year? Where do you think you could improve your skills or abilities to help you meet those goals?” Imagine beginning the meeting with a complete set of answers to these questions, answers that you don’t have to deliver. At least 80 percent of the time, they will have come to the same conclusions you’ve arrived at and the conversation will be a much more positive one. The wonderful thing about asking questions is that it can be effectively done in almost any medium. What if you sent a text or tweet to your team with a question about how to handle a recalcitrant client? Would that help employees who might be weak in this area reconsider their own methods or recognize that they don’t have one? You can ask pretty powerful questions in 140 characters or less. Questions allow you to create a conversation—in any medium—that can lead to a better place for all involved. And it allows everybody to feel that they were involved in shaping the outcome. Wouldn’t you rather be asked a question than be given an order?   5Mitigate Fault In the summer of 1941, Sergeant James Allen Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross for climbing out onto the wing of his Wellington bomber, thirteen thousand feet above Zuider Zee, to extinguish a fire in the starboard engine. Secured by only a rope around his waist, he managed to smother the fire and then return along the wing to the safety of the aircraft’s cabin. Winston Churchill, an admirer as well as a performer of swashbuckling exploits, summoned the shy New Zealander to 10 Downing Street. Ward, struck dumb with awe in Churchill’s presence, was unable to answer the prime minister’s questions. Churchill surveyed the unhappy hero with some compassion. “You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence,” he said. “Yes sir,” managed Ward. “Then you can imagine how humble and awkward I feel in yours,” said Churchill.1 With just a few words, Churchill moved Ward from a miserable fool to the hero he was. He mitigated fault and helped Ward save face. Few of us take the time to consider how to let another save face. We ride roughshod over others’ feelings, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or employee in front of others. We could offer a considerate word or two, take the other person’s feelings into account, pull them aside—anything to alleviate the sting. Yet many of us don’t take the time to do so. For leaders, what does this insensitive behavior instill in those around us? Fear of failure. If we know we will be berated for our failures, possibly even publicly, will we take any risks in our work? Will we attempt to be innovative or creative? Will we speak up with ideas and opinions? Probably not. Yet failure is an everyday part of our lives—at home, at work, in all of our endeavors. It is such a given that the venerable Harvard Business Review devoted its entire April 2011 issue to the subject. The cover heading and tagline? “The Failure Issue: How to Understand It, Learn from It, and Recover from It.” Not one mention of avoiding it. Of course, we intuitively know that failure is inevitable, so why can’t we be more supportive when somebody is suffering through it? An executive at a large media company was responsible for launching a new magazine. She spent a year’s worth of time, effort, and resources trying to get the fledgling publication off the ground, but it never flew. The magazine had to be cancelled. The CEO of the company, who could have fired or demoted the executive for the failure or who could have held her up as an example of what not to do, instead provided a psychological safety net, allowing the executive to save face. “The CEO stood up at a gathering of the firm’s top executives and congratulated the failed executive for her courage and skill, for doing the wrong thing in the right way. He emphasized that the ill-fated decision wasn’t just hers; senior management backed it, and the magazine failed despite great content and marketing,” writes Robert Sutton in Good Boss, Bad Boss.2 What this CEO epitomized in his actions was a technique that Sutton calls “forgive and remember,” a critical path for learning from mistakes and changing behavior. The technique was first described by Charles L. Bosk in his book Forgive and Remember: Managing Medical Failure.3 The goal is to help individuals achieve accountability while managing the existential problem of failure, a demoralizing inner battle for anyone. Isn’t this the true responsibility of any leader? Because if the battle is lost, the individual will learn little from the mistake, have a diminished self-image, become fearful, and contribute less to the success of a company, a family, or any other organization. Despite a leader’s best efforts, those in his care will fail. And he will fail. Recognizing this and the inherent benefits failure may present can help us learn how to help others come through it and land positively and securely on the opposite shore. Great leaders tap the creative and innovative power of their teams by helping them save face before they’ve even failed. Fiona Lee, Amy Edmundson, and Stefan Thomke conducted a study with 688 employees in a large health care organization during the rollout of a new data system that integrated and presented data from all departments and divisions within the organization. The employees received little training and were told to learn the system by experimenting with it.3 The findings? In departments where managers specifically told their teams that making mistakes was okay and didn’t set up reward systems that penalized people who did make mistakes, experimentation with the system was much greater. In departments where managers were inconsistent in their messages or punished failure, even subtly, employees experimented with the system much less. In fact, lower-status employees in those departments didn’t use the system at all because of their greater fear of failure. As you might expect, the employees who experimented the most with the new, more efficient system became the most proficient with it and used it regularly in their everyday work. What the supportive managers were actually developing within their team members, even if only on a small scale, was resilience. Resilience, explains Martin P. Seligman, author and positive psychology pioneer, is the difference in the ways people respond to failure. In his books and other writings, he describes how some people bounce back from failure, learning and growing from the experience, while others languish, becoming self-critical and fearful of the future. Which would you rather foster in the people in your life? Companies who recruit from the military have learned the value of resilience well; they recognize that people in the military are used to dealing with mistakes and failures, sometimes on an almost moment-by-moment basis, and moving forward purposefully despite them. Donovan Campbell, author of Joker One, a memoir about his experience as a platoon leader in Iraq, is part of PepsiCo’s elite Leadership Development Program. He explains the perspective he gained while commanding a platoon. In school you’re rewarded for not making mistakes. And then you get out and get a job, and a lot of times you get promoted because you make very few mistakes. And so what you do is you develop a mindset that mistakes are to be avoided at all costs. What you learn in the military is that it doesn’t matter how hard you try or how good you are. One, you will make mistakes; and two, sometimes events or the enemy or a changing situation will mean that you do not succeed, and in fact you fail. And you become comfortable with the idea.4 This mature approach to failure, as opposed to being frozen in a state of indecisiveness or inaction, is what we want from our employees and our leaders. Making it safe for them to fail is a sure way to ensure that they will more readily admit their mistakes (which is a key aspect of leadership we’ve explored), more quickly recover from them, more fully learn from them. As a leader, you will gain a more complete picture of their work and become a better coach and mentor for it. So how do we create this type of environment? Charlene Li, in her important book Open Leadership, maps out five actions that leaders can take to instill organizational resilience within their teams: • Acknowledge that failure happens. Leaders can acknowledge failures quickly when they happen, but they can also discuss with their teams the likelihood of failures occurring. • Encourage dialogue to foster trust. Honestly discussing problems is the best way to learn from them and to trim the seedlings before they become fully grown catastrophes. • Separate the person from the failure. Rather than saying “you failed,” say “the project failed.” In most cases, that is the truth. Amy Edmondson, Harvard professor and researcher, explored this point with executives. “When I ask executives to . . . estimate how many of the failures in their organizations are truly blameworthy, their answers are usually in single digits—perhaps 2% to 5%. But when I ask how many are treated as blameworthy, they say (after a pause or a laugh) 70% to 90%. The unfortunate consequence is that many failures go unreported and their lessons are lost.”5 • Learn from your mistakes. Otherwise, they are lost opportunities for learning and for coaching. • Create a risk-taking and failure system. Being methodical about how we approach risk and failure can help mitigate some of the emotional responses to it. Why go to these lengths? Alberto Alessi, the great Italian designer, described his company’s approach to design as an effort to find the borderline between what is possible and what is not possible and design along it. The best designs are those that fall right on the edge of the borderline, just this side of possible. That is the space of innovation, the space where we test our talents and grow as individuals. Of course, hugging the line means that you will often flop over it—you will fall into the realm of the impossible and fail. But what a glorious failure it will be, and who knows what might be learned from it. Famed vacuum cleaner designer Sir Richard Dyson produced more than five thousand prototypes before bringing his first product to market. What we must remember when faced with a person who has made a mistake is that how he handles it is dependent on the support he receives while living through the tough moment and learning from it. A primary difference between ordinary and extraordinary people is how they perceive and respond to failure. A good leader can influence which camp we fall into. Now, there are mistakes and then there are “mistakes.” Some mistakes come about from minor lapses in judgment, from inexperience, from the need for coaching. These are actual mistakes. Others come about from recklessness, greed, a lack of concern for others’ well-being, and a desire to elevate oneself at the expense of others. In these instances, it’s highly likely that the person at fault actually feels no remorse, no sense of accountability. Is it appropriate to help such an individual save face? Possibly not. If the mistake and attitude are severe enough, it’s likely that helping the other person save face would just exacerbate the problem. In these instances, it’s best to keep public comments to a minimum and use private conversations to address the severity of the issue as deftly as possible. Other than creating an environment in which people are not pilloried for their mistakes when part of a larger whole, Charlene Li’s advice can be transferred to situations when we should help an individual save face to recover from a minor error, oversight, or gaffe. • Acknowledge that a mistake was made, but do it gently. Pretending that nothing happened certainly meets the “forgive” criteria, but it seems a little disingenuous when the error was blatant. • Recognize and address your own role, even if minor. • Focus on what was gained. • When appropriate to do so without making others culpable, address the issue from a broad perspective. Imagine that you are at a function and are introduced to somebody you’ve met before, but he clearly doesn’t remember you. You could say, “We’ve met before,” throwing his error in his face. Or you could say, “Oh, hello, Mark. It’s nice to see you again. Did I see you at the Better Business Bureau lunch last month? It was a great networking event, although there were so many people, it was a bit overwhelming.” Today, our faults, missteps, and outright failures are so much more public than they once were. When an employee makes a mistake, it’s not surprising when a customer starts blogging about it, posts the experience on her Facebook page, or shoots off a quick email tirade to the CEO of the company. The employee is already in a position to feel humiliated and fearful. Why make it worse? Allowing others to save face is crucial in the digital age. Of course, helping someone save face is sometimes more difficult to do because his failures have been broadcast. It is important to maintain strict discipline in terms of what you write in emails. An email accidentally sent to the wrong person or hacked and posted on a blog may not only cause embarrassment but also ruin somebody’s professional reputation. If you need to discuss a mistake or gaffe that somebody made, it’s best to do it in person or over the phone. Save your written communication for praise and constructive advice. While it’s important to help others weather their failures gracefully, helping a customer or potential customer save face can be useful as a business tactic. Wolfgang Schmidt explained how his company, Rubbermaid, uses the technique to win new customers: We do get complaints. About half those complaints come about as a result of a consumer buying a product, thinking it’s ours, but it’s a competitor’s product. So the consumer writes to us. Our policy is simply to write a personal letter and say, “We can understand how you made the mistake because we have these competitors who copy our products. You made an honest mistake, but we would like for you to see directly the difference in value. So try one of ours for free.” We send them our replacement product for whatever it is they complained about. And we think that’s a wonderful way to communicate very credibly the story of Rubbermaid value.6 Even if the other person is wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. We do nothing to change his or her behavior. On the other hand, when we mitigate fault, we not only save the other person’s psyche, we build confidence and trust into our relationship with that person. Save someone’s face once and your influence with him rises. Save his face every time you can, and there is practically nothing he won’t do for you.   6Magnify Improvement One bright day in 2010, the hotel company Best Western created a special Facebook page. Visitors flocked to it. Hundreds of messages were posted to the wall. “Wallace makes weary travelers feel like they’re coming home! The best thing about the hotel lobby is his smile.” “Wallace is the best. We love going back just to visit with him!” “Upon leaving, the kids asked when we were coming back to see Wallace!” “I may pass him in the lobby or the hall fifteen times in a visit, and every time, he has a great big smile and something fun to say. He is one of the greatest parts of my visits!” “We should all relate to one another as Wallace does. If he ever has a bad day, you wouldn’t know it.” “In all of my travels, I’ve never encountered anyone more kind and helpful, more eager to make a guest feel welcome.” “My day is always made brighter by seeing Wallace. His always warm welcome, his knowledge of the city, his kindness and professionalism, and that terrific smile make my stay so enjoyable. . . . He has a special gift for connecting with people.” Who is this Wallace? Wallace Pope—Chicago native, single dad, longtime employee of Best Western River North Hotel, and a man who loves helping others. When Wallace was nominated for the Stars of the Industry award from the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, Best Western was determined to show its pride and support—and to help him win.1 So the company created a Facebook page called “Wallace Should Win” and encouraged visitors to the hotel to go to the page and share their stories of Wallace’s customer service skills. The page had 2,722 visits within the first week. Heartfelt stories of love and support poured in from the hotel’s customers. Wallace’s genuine kindness and his ability to improve customers’ travel and personal outlook were lauded again and again. And while Wallace didn’t win the award, the praise and encouragement he gained from the Facebook page was far more meaningful than a plaque. Praise and encouragement: the two essential elements of motivating any person to fulfill their potential, to improve, or to tackle change. Yet it’s difficult for many of us to recognize the efforts of those around us. Dr. Gerald Graham was curious about what managers could do to better motivate employees. So he surveyed fifteen hundred employees, and the results were rather shocking: • 58 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise from their manager • 76 percent reported that they seldom if ever received written thanks • 81 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise in public And yet praise from a manager, written thanks, and public praise were three of the top five motivators among the surveyed employees.2 These results were from 1982. Decades later, things haven’t changed all that much. Employees who receive frequent praise are still more productive, and organizations in which employees receive frequent praise are universally more successful. It’s one of the twelve indicators of success that Marcus Buckingham and Curt Koffman outline in First, Break All the Rules, indicators based on extensive Gallup Organization research. Yet managers are still notoriously bad at delivering praise. We all crave appreciation; we all desire to feel important. And when we have improved in some way or performed well, receiving praise sends a clear message that others have noticed and that it makes a difference. This is true at work, at home, at school, in our communities. One of the basic psychological tenets of human behavior is that we persist in behaviors for which we are praised; those behaviors that are not positively recognized are likely to fall by the wayside. The Center for Management and Organization Effectiveness offers the following advice for praising those around you:3 1. “Deliver praise from your heart.” Be genuine and sincere. 2. “Deliver praise as soon as possible.” Don’t wait for the next meeting, performance review, family meal, or church gathering. By then, the person’s own joy at the success has dissipated, and you’ve lost an opportunity to amplify that joy. 3. “Make praise specific.” A simple thank-you is not praise; it is politeness. To feel that their efforts are heading them down the path you want them to go, people need to know exactly what you valued in their effort. 4. “Praise people publicly.” In this era of social technology, praising publicly gets easier every day, so there is no real excuse not to do it. Best Western certainly did. Today you don’t have to wait for the next quarterly meeting to recognize a job well done. We should strive to praise as often as possible. Most of us don’t have to struggle to find opportunities to do so; we simply have to take advantage of the opportunities that exist every day. Captain Abrashoff of the USS Benfold understood the power of praise better than most: Most of my young sailors came from hardscrabble backgrounds and had struggled to make it into the Navy. I put myself in their parents’ shoes and imagined how they would feel if they got letters from their kids’ commanding officer, and I imagined how the kids would feel when their parents told them. I began writing letters to the parents, especially when their sons or daughters did something I could honestly praise. When the letters arrived, the parents invariably called their children to say how proud they were of them.4 One sailor was part of a team that had performed very well, but was himself not a star. Captain Abrashoff recognized that praising his accomplishments as part of a team would give this sailor the boost he most likely needed. So he sent the letter of praise to the young man’s parents. Two weeks later, the sailor knocked on Captain Abrashoff’s door with tears streaming down his face. “I just got a call from my father, who all my life told me I’m a failure. This time, he said he’s just read your letter, and he wanted to congratulate me and say how proud he was of me. It’s the first time in my entire life he’s actually encouraged me.” Obviously this was a powerful moment for this young man. How do you think it affected his view of what he could achieve and his level of devotion to the success of his team? Praise, while powerful and necessary, also implies evaluation against some standard. What great leaders and those with influence recognize is that the rest of the time, we must use encouragement. “Praise is given only when one achieves ‘good’ results; encouragement can be given any time, even when things go poorly.”5 That is the essence of encouragement—showing your belief in the talents, skills, and inherent abilities of another person because she exists, regardless of how things are going right now. Being encouraging requires a special attitude. When you look at another person, rather than seeing her faults, you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities, what she is capable of. Insincere encouragement, without the strength of your genuine faith in the other person, only belittles her efforts. What does encouragement foster in the other person? Psychological hardiness—the ability to weather the stressful and anxiety-inducing challenges that we encounter every day, to face those challenges and move forward in spite of them, to pick ourselves up and keep going, keep trying. It is the hallmark of positive, successful people. Encouragement provides motivation, and finding ways to motivate is a huge struggle for leaders in all areas of life. The primary cause of that struggle? Many of us don’t take the time to consider what actually motivates people. We often assume that people want material rewards, that the carrot-and-stick approach is the best approach—but this is rarely the case. People are genuinely more motivated by personal and social encouragement than by material rewards. Through his research on healthy marriages and families, author and psychologist Jon Carlson defined some essential practices that we can use to create an encouraging environment:6 1. Make healthy relationships a priority. Respect and positive communication are two key elements of making that happen. 2. Practice encouragement daily. Don’t wait until somebody has stumbled on the path toward a goal. Recognize every effort and every improvement, even if it is slight, to let them know that your faith in them is unwavering. 3. Be inclusive. For instance, include others in your decisionmaking process whenever possible; it shows your faith in their sound judgment. 4. Don’t let conflicts fester. When we’re in conflict mode, it’s easy to slip into discouraging or belittling dialogue. Compare “I think you can do it” and “Looks like we have problem—what should we do about it?” with “Just let me take care of this” or “I told you to be careful.” 5. Have fun! Clarence M. Jones, a Carnegie Institute instructor, told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct completely changed the life of his son: My son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas, with his mother. He had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow learners. Possibly because of the scar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a normal level. He was two years behind his age group, so he was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added on his fingers, and could barely read. There was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician. I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I decided to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. As we went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard stack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no more cards left. I made a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had missed it previously. Each night we would go through the repeat stack until there were no cards left. Each night we timed the exercise with a stopwatch. I promised him that when he could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41, then under 40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I’d call in my wife and we would both hug him and we’d all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun. Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply. He astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That had never happened before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school’s science fair and was entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati. That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had been told he was “brain-damaged,” who had been called “Frankenstein” by his classmates and told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through high school, he never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the national honor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life changed. Tell someone that you have total faith in his ability to accomplish a goal and encourage him by highlighting all of the skills he possesses that will help him along the way, and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel. Remember, abilities wither under criticism and blossom under encouragement. Magnify improvement and you maximize others’ talents.   7Give Others a Fine Reputation to Live Up To Benjamin Zander was tired—tired of watching his conservatory students, so anxious about the grading of their performances in his class, take a safe approach to their music education. In the top tiers of the arts world, bitter competition can define the talent development process. He considered abandoning grades altogether, but that presented a host of challenges, not the least of which was getting the head of the school to approve such a radical move. Instead, he decided he would give each student an A—on the very first day of class. Upon meeting his new and nervous students, he would say, “Each student in this class will get an A for the course. However, there is one requirement that you must fulfill to earn this grade: Some time during the next two weeks, you must write me a letter dated next May . . . and in this letter you are to tell, in as much detail as you can, the story of what will have happened to you by next May that is in line with this extraordinary grade.” He instructed the students to think of themselves in the future, looking back on all that they had done to earn such an illustrious grade. They were to discuss insights, milestones, and even competitions won. But Zander wanted more than a surface analysis. “I am especially interested in the person you will have become by next May. I am interested in the attitude, feelings, and worldview of that person who will have done all she wished to do or become everything he wanted to be,” he would say to them.1 What did he get from his students? Consider the following letter from a young trombonist: Dear Mr. Z: Today the world knows me. That drive of energy and intense emotion that you saw twisting and dormant inside me, yet, alas, I could not show in performance or conversation, was freed tonight in a program of new music composed for me. . . . The concert ended and no one stirred. A pregnant quiet. Sighs: and then applause that drowned my heart’s throbbing. I might have bowed—I cannot remember now. The clapping sustained such that I thought I might make my debut complete and celebrate the shedding of the mask and skinthat I had constructedto hide withinby improvising on my own melody as anencore—unaccompanied. What followed issomething of a blur. I forgot technique,pretension, tradition, schooling, history—truly even the audience.What came from my tromboneI wholly believe, was my ownVoice.Laughter, smiles,a frown, weepingTuckerspiritdid sing. —Tucker Dulin Over the ten months of his course, Zander watched his students transform themselves in astounding ways. He calls his approach “giving an A.” In his book The Art of Possibility, coauthored with his wife, Rosamund Stone Zander, he has this to say about its potential to foster greatness in an individual: An A can be given to anyone in any walk of life—to a waitress, to your employer, to your mother-in-law, to the members of the opposite team, and to the other drivers in traffic. When you give an A, you find yourself speaking to people not from a place of measuring how they stack up against your standards, but from a place of respect that gives them room to realize themselves. . . . This A is not an expectation to live up to, but a possibility to live into.2 What a magical perspective to assume in an often cynical world. Coaches, mentors, leaders, and parents often find that people live up to our expectations of them, no matter how diminished those expectations are. If a man feels unimportant or disrespected, he will have little motivation for improving himself. So why not create a vision of him that embodies everything you know he is capable of achieving, as well as everything you don’t know about his possibilities? You will rarely be disappointed. Paige Ann Michelle McCabe’s mother described her own adventures in creating a big-girl reputation for her daughter: Four-year-old Paige Ann Michelle McCabe was sitting on one of our kitchen stools when she heard me tell her six-year-old brother, Brandon, that it was now his responsibility to set the table each night before dinner. Paige looked hopeful and almost teary. “What am I big enough to do now, Mummy? What can I do ’cause I’m big too?” Not wanting to break her little heart or deflate her ego, I searched quickly for something that she could take responsibility for. An idea crept into my head just in time. “Paige Ann Michelle,” I announced triumphantly, “now that you are four years old, and old enough to make proper choices, you are responsible for choosing your clothes for the next day. Each night before you take a bath, you should get your clothes out of your drawer, and put them on the bed ready to wear in the morning when you wake up.” The house was a flurry of activity. Brandon was zooming around setting the table, and Paige ran straight to her room, where I could hear drawers and cupboards hurriedly opening and closing. About ten seconds later she ran out to report her success. “Look, Mummy, I did it, I got them out! Come and see, come and see!” Sure enough, the clothes were laid out on the bed, ready to go. I told her how proud I was, now that she was growing up and had her very own job to do, and she beamed. The next morning, a miracle occurred in the McCabe house. Usually, Mummy has to coax a grumpy Paige out of bed, and getting her dressed is difficult, to say the least. If I choose a blue skirt, she wants to wear red pants. If I choose a white shirt with butterflies, she wants to wear the purple shirt with flowers on it. Finally when I give in and tell her to choose, she takes forever. Paige stays grumpy and I end up frustrated. But not that morning. “Look what I am wearing, Mummy!” she said. She had got herself dressed before I had asked her to! I kissed her proudly and told her how happy I was with her choices. It was morning and Paige Ann Michelle McCabe was happy. What a difference that made! Paige Ann Michelle McCabe had lived up to the fine reputation of a grown-up four-year-old that had been bestowed upon her. To change somebody’s behavior, change the level of respect she receives by giving her a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait you are trying to influence is already one of the person’s outstanding characteristics.   8Stay Connected on Common Ground The employees of a manufacturing company had been on strike for six months when a labor contract was finally agreed upon. The terms, however, were less than what the employees had originally asked for. While the employees did return to work, tensions were running high on both sides. The working environment was toxic. How could they get past the animosity and move forward? In Crucial Conversations, authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzer described how they worked with the two groups to build bridges. They instructed each group to spend time considering their goals for the company and to write them out on poster-sized paper. Each group spent two hours discussing their goals, then wrote the goals on the paper and posted it on the wall in the room they were in. The coaches then asked the teams to switch rooms and to review the other group’s goals with the purpose of finding at least some morsel of common ground. What do you think happened? When the two groups returned to the meeting room, they were amazed. Their goals were almost identical: “a profitable company, stable and rewarding jobs, high-quality products, and a positive impact on the community.”1 While this revelation didn’t erase the past, it provided each group with a new perspective on the other. They learned something about each other that would make it easier to reach more positive outcomes in the future. Why is common ground so important? For a leader to effectively influence another’s attitude or behavior, he needs to overcome any potential resistance by making the person feel glad to do what is being asked. We aren’t talking about manipulation or mind control here. If you consider what the other’s goals are and how to connect your goals to hers, you will create a win-win situation that will make everybody glad. It is amazing how simple it is today to find a connection with another when we take the time to. If you go on an interview or a sales call, wouldn’t you spend time researching the company, discovering its vision, its stated goals, its values? All of this is information that many companies post front and center on their websites. And many go much further, posting employee bios, press releases, and updated information on their blogs. Yet we often don’t take the time to make these same inroads with those in our lives, those standing right in front of us, even though it is just as easy. Ask people what they did over the weekend, what they hope to do for their next vacation, or what books they’ve recently read, and you’ll discover something compelling and revealing about their goals, their dreams. And if you’re connected with them online, it may be even easier. Six degrees to Kevin Bacon is an interesting pop culture phenomenon, but it’s actually a fantastic way to think about those you want to influence. When you expand the translation to include common interests, common experiences, common goals, the truth is that we are only one degree away from anyone. To be influential with others, to make them happy to do what it is we would like them to do, we simply have to find that one degree that connects us. One student of the Dale Carnegie Training Institute in Germany discovered that taking the bold path of simply writing to those people she wanted to learn more about—to possibly find that one degree of connection—produced wondrous results. As I was very shy, I decided to write emails to the people I was interested in. I researched and found the addresses of very famous and well-known people and started to ask them questions about their backgrounds, such as how they got started in their businesses and what was important to them personally. Two weeks later I received a two-paged letter from the German president Johannes Rau, who answered my questions. Six weeks later I received another letter. It was a big envelope, and a book was enclosed that would answer my questions. It was sent to me by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. What did this person learn? If you make the effort, people—all people, even those who seem unapproachable—will tell you their stories, their motivations and their goals. One night, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship sports league, accidentally tweeted his direct phone number to more than one million fans, who retweeted it to untold numbers of people. The fans began calling within minutes. A leader less focused on making his customers happy would have called the phone company and had his number changed immediately. But that is not what Dana White did. For more than an hour and a half, he took the calls that came in and talked to the fans. They loved it. It was a fortunate mistake, and Dana White learned a lot from it. He learned that talking to fans was valuable, and the PR company that helps manage UFC’s online presence learned that they had a new opportunity to “provide value to fans, when, where and how they want to receive it.”2 Now Dana White has a dedicated line that he uses to take calls from fans. It’s posted on all of his social media outlets. When he has time, he lets them know he’s ready to talk, and the phone starts ringing. His accidental ninety minutes on the phone with UFC fans from all over the world was no gimmick, and that is key to ultimate fighting being the fastest-growing sport in the world, according to Mashable’s Greg Ferenstein.3 White has been passionate about connecting with fans through social media from the start, and relied on the grassroots support of his fans when major media refused to cover UFC events. When he hired Digital Royalty to grow UFC’s online presence and train the fighters in social media techniques, he told the fighters, “I want you to tweet your asses off!” The secret of his success in connecting with his fans: he is brutally honest and frank. To prove the power of this connection to a companion, White left a restaurant and walked to a nearby gas station at eleven-thirty at night. He tweeted his location. Within three minutes, there were about one hundred fans there. In his analysis of Dana White’s efforts, Greg Ferenstein wrote, “Transparency, outreach and openness are now more important than ever, as social media allows fans to subvert traditional channels and voice their opinions directly. White is willing to meet them halfway, foregoing false showmanship in order to genuinely connect with fans.” While social media is a great tool for learning what drives somebody, it is only a tool. What leaders need to foster within themselves is a genuine desire to ascertain the answer and then to act on the information, a desire that many failed executives undermine, both knowingly and unknowingly. Of this depreciated desire among many high-powered executives, Derailed author Dr. Tim Irwin concludes: Just as humility seems to be at the epicenter of leadership effectiveness, arrogance is commonly at the root of a leader’s undoing . . . and ours. . . . Arrogance takes many forms. The most rudimentary is the self-centered focus that fosters a belief that I am central to the viability of the organization, the department or the team. The resulting dismissiveness of others’ contributions is inevitable. When arrogance blossoms into hubris, a sense of entitlement results. “This place can’t function without me, and I deserve special perks.” Arrogant leaders also seem to eschew feedback so beneficial to any leader. They become truth-starved.4 A contrasting approach is found in Yvon Chouinard, co-founder (with his wife, Malinda) of Patagonia and author of Let My People Go Surfing. Yvon is proud of the fact that Patagonia hires the intensely independent—people who “would be considered unemployable in a typical company,” he’s been told by organizational consultants. While he revels in his independent-minded employees, it also presents a management challenge: how to build a collaborative unit all focused on the same goals. One tool he uses is the design of the offices. “No one has a private office in our company and everyone works in open rooms with no doors or separations [including Yvon and Malinda]. What we lose in ‘quiet thinking space’ is more than made up for with better communication and an egalitarian atmosphere.”5 Now take it a step further and consider Admiral Janitorial Services, the fictional company described in Matthew Kelly’s The Dream Manager. Turnover is high and costly, not surprising for a company staffed by transient workers. What to do? First, find out their biggest struggle. The company assumes that the biggest cause of turnover is pay, but when it surveys the employees it discovers that their biggest struggle is transportation. Many rely on public transportation, which is spotty and even dangerous at night. What should the leaders of the company do? They provide shuttle service. It’s costly, but what they save in turnover costs more than makes up for it. Employees stay twice as long, sick days have dropped, and morale is higher. Still, the leaders know they could do better. What really makes people leave? they wonder. The jobs are dead-end ones, not dream-fulfilling positions, and everybody knows it. The leaders decide that they can’t fix that, but they can find ways to help employees move closer to their dreams while they work for Admiral. So they ask the employees, “What are your dreams?” Surprisingly (or maybe not), the employees tell them. Now the company has powerful information—and it uses it to help the employees achieve their dreams. One employee wants to learn Spanish; another, who happens to be a Spanish speaker, wants to teach. So the company connects them. Yes, this story is fictional, but does the example seem extreme? Why shouldn’t we know what our colleagues, coworkers, friends, and family members dream? How powerful that information would be. How central that information would be for sustaining a course whereby you and those in your sphere of influence achieve what is desired. Do you know what motivates the people around you? There are simple ways to find out. And once you have the information, it is a simple process to link your desired outcomes with their goals: 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. 2. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants. 3. Consider the benefits the person will receive from doing what you suggest. 4. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 5. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. The more you know of others and the more they know of you, the easier it will be to find common ground on which to base all future creativity and collaboration. Staying connected with customers in the digital world, says Richard Branson, the Virgin Group mogul recently voted Most Influential British Business Figure, is keeping many executives awake at night. How companies adapt to this energetic and sometimes chaotic world will define their future success. The website, Facebook page, blog and Twitter feed are no longer add-ons to a business’s communication budget: They should be central to its marketing strategy, and used in coordination with other marketing efforts.6 The key, says Branson, is not defaulting your digital media into mere transactional mode; instead, open them wide for ongoing communication as well. We now live in a connected world where the idea of companies and customers being instantly and constantly in touch is not an exception; it’s the expectation. “The rise of social media,” writes Branson, has presented exciting challenges and caused us to question our usual ways of doing business. . . . To succeed, such efforts must be supported from the top. David Cush, CEO of Virgin America, freed up the management of these social media channels from the company’s classic hierarchy. His social media team is made up of 20-somethings who have been given broad guidelines and then let loose. These digital natives at Virgin have employed Facebook and Twitter as part of the company’s communication strategy. This open digital connection allowed for a unique connection opportunity that flowed into a successful marketing campaign. Many West Coast animal shelters were bursting at the seams with Chihuahuas, and something needed to be done to give the little dogs a better chance to find good homes. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals intervened, contacting Virgin America and asking if the airline would help fly several dogs from San Francisco to New York. Virgin immediately agreed and even volunteered crew members to accompany the small passengers. Virgin’s digital team promoted this story through all their communication channels. “It went viral,” explains Branson, “and also sparked the interest of the traditional media—drawing attention to the ASPCA and Virgin Atlantic’s efforts to help. We then used the story as the basis of a very successful online sale on flights to Mexico.” The traditional roles of advertising, marketing, and customer relations have changed. So too has the role of today’s leader. In digital time and space, with open access and frequent communication, the perfunctory principles of corporate activity have largely broken down and been replaced by the basic principles of human relations. If you don’t know how to win friends and influence people in a genuine and positive manner today, not only will you have trouble keeping pace in a marketplace ruled by the consumer, you will also have trouble keeping your people employed. Long gone are the days when leaders can lord it over their reports from behind closed doors in top-floor offices accessible only by private elevators. In truth, those days never existed where effective leadership is concerned—not in 1936 and not now. Today, with full-time connectivity as the norm, the consequences of remote leadership are more palpable. Physical proximity is not the main issue. Relational proximity is. While an individual can only occasionally maintain a productive, progressive relationship without a reasonable measure of physical presence, no person in the world—especially a leader—can maintain progressive influence without relational proximity. It is true that the world is now open for business, but your first task remains the business of humanity. The greatest endeavors are and always will be interdependent and interactive. In the end, the art of winning friends and influencing people in the digital age is summed up in the activity of connecting and staying connected on common ground.

/home/jeff/Downloads/QuantumPlotBertBooks/The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life (Mark Manson) (z-lib.org).epub,"               CHAPTER 1 Don’t Try Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet. He’s probably the last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in any sort of self-help book. Which is why he’s the perfect place to start. Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected by almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he submitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved. And as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed him deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of his life. Bukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit money and spent most of it on booze. He gambled away the rest at the racetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry on his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having passed out the night before. Thirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol, drugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a lifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent publishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn’t offer Bukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird affection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was the first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the only one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one of two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.” Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks. It was called simply Post Office. In the dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to nobody.” Bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of his books. His popularity defied everyone’s expectations, particularly his own. Stories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative. Bukowski’s life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s practically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski’s and say, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always believed in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of himself!” It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t try.” See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the worst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt. This is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a failure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every woman he could find. Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful. Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing. Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day. But when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice—all the positive and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time—is actually fixating on what you lack. It lasers in on what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be, and then emphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to make money because you feel you don’t have enough money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you’re beautiful because you feel as though you’re not beautiful already. You follow dating and relationship advice because you feel that you’re unlovable already. You try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful because you feel as though you aren’t successful enough already. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is. There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not. And if you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are not that. Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick. Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business. And while there’s nothing wrong with good business, the problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health. It causes you to become overly attached to the superficial and fake, to dedicate your life to chasing a mirage of happiness and satisfaction. The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important. The Feedback Loop from Hell There’s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey? Or let’s say you have an anger problem. You get pissed off at the stupidest, most inane stuff, and you have no idea why. And the fact that you get pissed off so easily starts to piss you off even more. And then, in your petty rage, you realize that being angry all the time makes you a shallow and mean person, and you hate this; you hate it so much that you get angry at yourself. Now look at you: you’re angry at yourself getting angry about being angry. Fuck you, wall. Here, have a fist. Or you’re so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you’re worrying. Or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you’re feeling. Or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about it. Welcome to the Feedback Loop from Hell. Chances are you’ve engaged in it more than a few times. Maybe you’re engaging in it right now: “God, I do the Feedback Loop all the time—I’m such a loser for doing it. I should stop. Oh my God, I feel like such a loser for calling myself a loser. I should stop calling myself a loser. Ah, fuck! I’m doing it again! See? I’m a loser! Argh!” Calm down, amigo. Believe it or not, this is part of the beauty of being human. Very few animals on earth have the ability to think cogent thoughts to begin with, but we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts about our thoughts. So I can think about watching Miley Cyrus videos on YouTube, and then immediately think about what a sicko I am for wanting to watch Miley Cyrus videos on YouTube. Ah, the miracle of consciousness! Now here’s the problem: Our society today, through the wonders of consumer culture and hey-look-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours social media, has bred a whole generation of people who believe that having these negative experiences—anxiety, fear, guilt, etc.—is totally not okay. I mean, if you look at your Facebook feed, everybody there is having a fucking grand old time. Look, eight people got married this week! And some sixteen-year-old on TV got a Ferrari for her birthday. And another kid just made two billion dollars inventing an app that automatically delivers you more toilet paper when you run out. Meanwhile, you’re stuck at home flossing your cat. And you can’t help but think your life sucks even more than you thought. The Feedback Loop from Hell has become a borderline epidemic, making many of us overly stressed, overly neurotic, and overly self-loathing. Back in Grandpa’s day, he would feel like shit and think to himself, “Gee whiz, I sure do feel like a cow turd today. But hey, I guess that’s just life. Back to shoveling hay.” But now? Now if you feel like shit for even five minutes, you’re bombarded with 350 images of people totally happy and having amazing fucking lives, and it’s impossible to not feel like there’s something wrong with you. It’s this last part that gets us into trouble. We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me? This is why not giving a fuck is so key. This is why it’s going to save the world. And it’s going to save it by accepting that the world is totally fucked and that’s all right, because it’s always been that way, and always will be. By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, “I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?” And then, as if sprinkled by magic fuck-giving fairy dust, you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad. George Orwell said that to see what’s in front of one’s nose requires a constant struggle. Well, the solution to our stress and anxiety is right there in front of our noses, and we’re too busy watching porn and advertisements for ab machines that don’t work, wondering why we’re not banging a hot blonde with a rocking six-pack, to notice. We joke online about “first-world problems,” but we really have become victims of our own success. Stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years, despite the fact that everyone has a flat-screen TV and can have their groceries delivered. Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual. We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we don’t even know what to give a fuck about anymore. Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be. And this rips us apart inside. Because here’s the thing that’s wrong with all of the “How to Be Happy” shit that’s been shared eight million times on Facebook in the past few years—here’s what nobody realizes about all of this crap: The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. This is a total mind-fuck. So I’ll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there. It’s like this one time I tripped on acid and it felt like the more I walked toward a house, the farther away the house got from me. And yes, I just used my LSD hallucinations to make a philosophical point about happiness. No fucks given. As the existential philosopher Albert Camus said (and I’m pretty sure he wasn’t on LSD at the time): “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” Or put more simply: Don’t try. Now, I know what you’re saying: “Mark, this is making my nipples all hard, but what about the Camaro I’ve been saving up for? What about the beach body I’ve been starving myself for? After all, I paid a lot of money for that ab machine! What about the big house on the lake I’ve been dreaming of? If I stop giving a fuck about those things—well, then I’ll never achieve anything. I don’t want that to happen, do I?” So glad you asked. Ever notice that sometimes when you care less about something, you do better at it? Notice how it’s often the person who is the least invested in the success of something that actually ends up achieving it? Notice how sometimes when you stop giving a fuck, everything seems to fall into place? What’s with that? What’s interesting about the backwards law is that it’s called “backwards” for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance. Seriously, I could keep going, but you get the point. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame. Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable. In my life, I have given a fuck about many things. I have also not given a fuck about many things. And like the road not taken, it was the fucks not given that made all the difference. Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and then went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your own life when you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary height. For myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks to start an Internet business ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it. These moments of non-fuckery are the moments that most define our lives. The major switch in careers; the spontaneous choice to drop out of college and join a rock band; the decision to finally dump that deadbeat boyfriend whom you caught wearing your pantyhose a few too many times. To not give a fuck is to stare down life’s most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action. While not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it. Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give too many fucks about the rude gas station attendant who gave us our change in nickels. We give too many fucks when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give too many fucks when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. Meanwhile, our credit cards are maxed out, our dog hates us, and Junior is snorting meth in the bathroom, yet we’re getting pissed off about nickels and Everybody Loves Raymond. Look, this is how it works. You’re going to die one day. I know that’s kind of obvious, but I just wanted to remind you in case you’d forgotten. You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked. There is a subtle art to not giving a fuck. And though the concept may sound ridiculous and I may sound like an asshole, what I’m talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively—how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values. This is incredibly difficult. It takes a lifetime of practice and discipline to achieve. And you will regularly fail. But it is perhaps the most worthy struggle one can undertake in one’s life. It is perhaps the only struggle in one’s life. Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck When most people envision giving no fucks whatsoever, they imagine a kind of serene indifference to everything, a calm that weathers all storms. They imagine and aspire to be a person who is shaken by nothing and caves in to no one. There’s a name for a person who finds no emotion or meaning in anything: a psychopath. Why you would want to emulate a psychopath, I have no fucking clue. So what does not giving a fuck mean? Let’s look at three “subtleties” that should help clarify the matter. Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different. Let’s be clear. There’s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They’re couch potatoes and Internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or combing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so they hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They’re afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand. Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices. They hide in a gray, emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitying, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life. Because here’s a sneaky truth about life. There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. You must give a fuck about something. It’s part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck. The question, then, is, What do we give a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter? My mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of The Wire. Sorry, Mom. But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that, Mom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I don’t give a fuck. I will ruin this guy’s life if I have to.” This illustrates the first subtlety of not giving a fuck. When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about anything; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. We mean that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesn’t give a fuck. This is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass—the overcoming adversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway. Because they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego. They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return. Because here’s another sneaky little truth about life. You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others. You just can’t. Because there’s no such thing as a lack of adversity. It doesn’t exist. The old saying goes that no matter where you go, there you are. Well, the same is true for adversity and failure. No matter where you go, there’s a five-hundred-pound load of shit waiting for you. And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with. Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity. Imagine you’re at a grocery store, and you watch an elderly lady scream at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her thirty-cent coupon. Why does this lady give a fuck? It’s just thirty cents. I’ll tell you why: That lady probably doesn’t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons. She’s old and lonely. Her kids are dickheads and never visit. She hasn’t had sex in over thirty years. She can’t fart without extreme lower-back pain. Her pension is on its last legs, and she’s probably going to die in a diaper thinking she’s in Candy Land. So she snips coupons. That’s all she’s got. It’s her and her damn coupons. It’s all she can give a fuck about because there is nothing else to give a fuck about. And so when that pimply-faced seventeen-year-old cashier refuses to accept one of them, when he defends his cash register’s purity the way knights used to defend maidens’ virginity, you can bet Granny is going to erupt. Eighty years of fucks will rain down all at once, like a fiery hailstorm of “Back in my day” and “People used to show more respect” stories. The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to. If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you—your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that’s your real problem. Not the hand sanitizer. Not the TV remote. I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. I think what most people—especially educated, pampered middle-class white people—consider “life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about. It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes. Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about. People aren’t just born not giving a fuck. In fact, we’re born giving way too many fucks. Ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue? Exactly. Fuck that kid. When we’re young, everything is new and exciting, and everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything and everyone—about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not, or what color our birthday balloon is. As we get older, with the benefit of experience (and having seen so much time slip by), we begin to notice that most of these sorts of things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives. Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best. We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them. Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called maturity. It’s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said to his partner Detective McNulty in The Wire (which, fuck you, I still downloaded): “That’s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasn’t your turn to give a fuck.” Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy level drops. Our identity solidifies. We know who we are and we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren’t thrilled about. And, in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And, to our astonishment, this is enough. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis. And we start to think, Maybe that crazy alcoholic Bukowski was onto something. Don’t try. So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway? This book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you’re choosing to find important in life and what you’re choosing to find unimportant. I believe that today we’re facing a psychological epidemic, one in which people no longer realize it’s okay for things to suck sometimes. I know that sounds intellectually lazy on the surface, but I promise you, it’s a life/death sort of issue. Because when we believe that it’s not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves. We start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser on a Tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids. This belief that it’s not okay to be inadequate sometimes is the source of the growing Feedback Loop from Hell that is coming to dominate our culture. The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of “practical enlightenment.” No, not that airy-fairy, eternal bliss, end-of-all-suffering, bullshitty kind of enlightenment. On the contrary, I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable—that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it. This book doesn’t give a fuck about alleviating your problems or your pain. And that is precisely why you will know it’s being honest. This book is not some guide to greatness—it couldn’t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis. Instead, this book will turn your pain into a tool, your trauma into power, and your problems into slightly better problems. That is real progress. Think of it as a guide to suffering and how to do it better, more meaningfully, with more compassion and more humility. It’s a book about moving lightly despite your heavy burdens, resting easier with your greatest fears, laughing at your tears as you cry them. This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go. It will teach you to take inventory of your life and scrub out all but the most important items. It will teach you to close your eyes and trust that you can fall backwards and still be okay. It will teach you to give fewer fucks. It will teach you to not try.     CHAPTER 2 Happiness Is a Problem About twenty-five hundred years ago, in the Himalayan foothills of present-day Nepal, there lived in a great palace a king who was going to have a son. For this son the king had a particularly grand idea: he would make the child’s life perfect. The child would never know a moment of suffering—every need, every desire, would be accounted for at all times. The king built high walls around the palace that prevented the prince from knowing the outside world. He spoiled the child, lavishing him with food and gifts, surrounding him with servants who catered to his every whim. And just as planned, the child grew up ignorant of the routine cruelties of human existence. All of the prince’s childhood went on like this. But despite the endless luxury and opulence, the prince became kind of a pissed-off young man. Soon, every experience felt empty and valueless. The problem was that no matter what his father gave him, it never seemed enough, never meant anything. So late one night, the prince snuck out of the palace to see what was beyond its walls. He had a servant drive him through the local village, and what he saw horrified him. For the first time in his life, the prince saw human suffering. He saw sick people, old people, homeless people, people in pain, even people dying. The prince returned to the palace and found himself in a sort of existential crisis. Not knowing how to process what he’d seen, he got all emo about everything and complained a lot. And, as is so typical of young men, the prince ended up blaming his father for the very things his father had tried to do for him. It was the riches, the prince thought, that had made him so miserable, that had made life seem so meaningless. He decided to run away. But the prince was more like his father than he knew. He had grand ideas too. He wouldn’t just run away; he would give up his royalty, his family, and all of his possessions and live in the streets, sleeping in dirt like an animal. There he would starve himself, torture himself, and beg for scraps of food from strangers for the rest of his life. The next night, the prince snuck out of the palace again, this time never to return. For years he lived as a bum, a discarded and forgotten remnant of society, the dog shit caked to the bottom of the social totem pole. And as planned, the prince suffered greatly. He suffered through disease, hunger, pain, loneliness, and decay. He confronted the brink of death itself, often limited to eating a single nut each day. A few years went by. Then a few more. And then . . . nothing happened. The prince began to notice that this life of suffering wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be. It wasn’t bringing him the insight he had desired. It wasn’t revealing any deeper mystery of the world or its ultimate purpose. In fact, the prince came to know what the rest of us have always kind of known: that suffering totally sucks. And it’s not necessarily that meaningful either. As with being rich, there is no value in suffering when it’s done without purpose. And soon the prince came to the conclusion that his grand idea, like his father’s, was in fact a fucking terrible idea and he should probably go do something else instead. Totally confused, the prince cleaned himself up and went and found a big tree near a river. He decided that he would sit under that tree and not get up until he came up with another grand idea. As the legend goes, the confused prince sat under that tree for forty-nine days. We won’t delve into the biological viability of sitting in the same spot for forty-nine days, but let’s just say that in that time the prince came to a number of profound realizations. One of those realizations was this: that life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention. This isn’t to say that all suffering is equal. Some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering. But we all must suffer nonetheless. Years later, the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world, and this would be its first and central tenet: that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them. The prince would later become known as the Buddha. And in case you haven’t heard of him, he was kind of a big deal. There is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs. The premise is that happiness is algorithmic, that it can be worked for and earned and achieved as if it were getting accepted to law school or building a really complicated Lego set. If I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y, then I can be happy. If I can be with a person like Z, then I can be happy. This premise, though, is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we’ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness. The Buddha argued this from a theological and philosophical perspective. I will make the same argument in this chapter, but I will make it from a biological perspective, and with pandas. The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda If I could invent a superhero, I would invent one called Disappointment Panda. He’d wear a cheesy eye mask and a shirt (with a giant capital T on it) that was way too small for his big panda belly, and his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but didn’t want to accept. He would go door-to-door like a Bible salesman and ring doorbells and say things like, “Sure, making a lot of money makes you feel good, but it won’t make your kids love you,” or “If you have to ask yourself if you trust your wife, then you probably don’t,” or “What you consider ‘friendship’ is really just your constant attempts to impress people.” Then he’d tell the homeowner to have a nice day and saunter on down to the next house. It would be awesome. And sick. And sad. And uplifting. And necessary. After all, the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear. Disappointment Panda would be the hero that none of us would want but all of us would need. He’d be the proverbial vegetables to our mental diet of junk food. He’d make our lives better despite making us feel worse. He’d make us stronger by tearing us down, brighten our future by showing us the darkness. Listening to him would be like watching a movie where the hero dies in the end: you love it even more despite making you feel horrible, because it feels real. So while we’re here, allow me to put on my Disappointment Panda mask and drop another unpleasant truth on you: We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature. Pain, in all of its forms, is our body’s most effective means of spurring action. Take something as simple as stubbing your toe. If you’re like me, when you stub your toe you scream enough four-letter words to make Pope Francis cry. You also probably blame some poor inanimate object for your suffering. “Stupid table,” you say. Or maybe you even go so far as to question your entire interior design philosophy based on your throbbing foot: “What kind of idiot puts a table there anyway? Seriously?” But I digress. That horrible stubbed-toe-induced pain, the one you and I and the pope hate so much, exists for an important reason. Physical pain is a product of our nervous system, a feedback mechanism to give us a sense of our own physical proportions—where we can and cannot move and what we can and cannot touch. When we exceed those limits, our nervous system duly punishes us to make sure that we pay attention and never do it again. And this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful. Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us what’s good for us versus what’s bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations. It teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves or stick metal objects into electrical sockets. Therefore, it’s not always beneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure, since pain can, at times, be life-or-death important to our well-being. But pain is not merely physical. As anyone who has had to sit through the first Star Wars prequel can tell you, we humans are capable of experiencing acute psychological pain as well. In fact, research has found that our brains don’t register much difference between physical pain and psychological pain. So when I tell you that my first girlfriend cheating on me and leaving me felt like having an ice pick slowly inserted into the center of my heart, that’s because, well, it hurt so much I might as well have had an ice pick slowly inserted into the center of my heart. Like physical pain, our psychological pain is an indication of something out of equilibrium, some limitation that has been exceeded. And like our physical pain, our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable. In some cases, experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary. Just like stubbing our toe teaches us to walk into fewer tables, the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. And this is what’s so dangerous about a society that coddles itself more and more from the inevitable discomforts of life: we lose the benefits of experiencing healthy doses of pain, a loss that disconnects us from the reality of the world around us. You may salivate at the thought of a problem-free life full of everlasting happiness and eternal compassion, but back here on earth the problems never cease. Seriously, problems don’t end. Disappointment Panda just dropped by. We had margaritas, and he told me all about it: problems never fucking go away, he said—they just improve. Warren Buffett’s got money problems; the drunk hobo down at Kwik-E Mart’s got money problems. Buffett’s just got better money problems than the hobo. All of life is like this. “Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,” the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. “The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.” A moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we’re at it, who made these margaritas? “Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.” And with that, he set his glass down, adjusted his sombrero, and sauntered off into the sunset. Happiness Comes from Solving Problems Problems are a constant in life. When you solve your health problem by buying a gym membership, you create new problems, like having to get up early to get to the gym on time, sweating like a meth-head for thirty minutes on an elliptical, and then getting showered and changed for work so you don’t stink up the whole office. When you solve your problem of not spending enough time with your partner by designating Wednesday night “date night,” you generate new problems, such as figuring out what to do every Wednesday that you both won’t hate, making sure you have enough money for nice dinners, rediscovering the chemistry and spark you two feel you’ve lost, and unraveling the logistics of fucking in a small bathtub filled with too many bubbles. Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded. Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place. To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific guru or teacher. It doesn’t magically appear when you finally make enough money to add on that extra room to the house. You don’t find it waiting for you in a place, an idea, a job—or even a book, for that matter. Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress—the solutions to today’s problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow’s problems, and so on. True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. Sometimes those problems are simple: eating good food, traveling to some new place, winning at the new video game you just bought. Other times those problems are abstract and complicated: fixing your relationship with your mother, finding a career you can feel good about, developing better friendships. Whatever your problems are, the concept is the same: solve problems; be happy. Unfortunately, for many people, life doesn’t feel that simple. That’s because they fuck things up in at least one of two ways: 1.   Denial. Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality. This may make them feel good in the short term, but it leads to a life of insecurity, neuroticism, and emotional repression. 2.   Victim Mentality. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances. This may make them feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, helplessness, and despair. People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that it’s easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad. Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high. They are a way to temporarily escape our problems, and that escape can provide us a quick rush that makes us feel better. Highs come in many forms. Whether it’s a substance like alcohol, the moral righteousness that comes from blaming others, or the thrill of some new risky adventure, highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’s life. Much of the self-help world is predicated on peddling highs to people rather than solving legitimate problems. Many self-help gurus teach you new forms of denial and pump you up with exercises that feel good in the short term, while ignoring the underlying issue. Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy. Highs also generate addiction. The more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems, the more you will seek them out. In this sense, almost anything can become addictive, depending on the motivation behind using it. We all have our chosen methods to numb the pain of our problems, and in moderate doses there is nothing wrong with this. But the longer we avoid and the longer we numb, the more painful it will be when we finally do confront our issues. Emotions Are Overrated Emotions evolved for one specific purpose: to help us live and reproduce a little bit better. That’s it. They’re feedback mechanisms telling us that something is either likely right or likely wrong for us—nothing more, nothing less. Much as the pain of touching a hot stove teaches you not to touch it again, the sadness of being alone teaches you not to do the things that made you feel so alone again. Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change. Look, I don’t mean to make light of your midlife crisis or the fact that your drunk dad stole your bike when you were eight years old and you still haven’t gotten over it, but when it comes down to it, if you feel crappy it’s because your brain is telling you that there’s a problem that’s unaddressed or unresolved. In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it. Then, like everything else, the positive emotions go away, because more problems inevitably emerge. Emotions are part of the equation of our lives, but not the entire equation. Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. Therefore, we shouldn’t always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them. Many people are taught to repress their emotions for various personal, social, or cultural reasons—particularly negative emotions. Sadly, to deny one’s negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems. As a result, many of these repressed individuals struggle to deal with problems throughout their lives. And if they can’t solve problems, then they can’t be happy. Remember, pain serves a purpose. But then there are those people who overidentify with their emotions. Everything is justified for no other reason than they felt it. “Oh, I broke your windshield, but I was really mad; I couldn’t help it.” Or “I dropped out of school and moved to Alaska just because it felt right.” Decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks. You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs. You know what else three-year-olds and dogs do? Shit on the carpet. An obsession and overinvestment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more. A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of “something else”—a new house, a new relationship, another child, another pay raise. And despite all of our sweat and strain, we end up feeling eerily similar to how we started: inadequate. Psychologists sometimes refer to this concept as the “hedonic treadmill”: the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different. This is why our problems are recursive and unavoidable. The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. What we gain is also what we lose. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences. This is a difficult pill to swallow. We like the idea that there’s some form of ultimate happiness that can be attained. We like the idea that we can alleviate all of our suffering permanently. We like the idea that we can feel fulfilled and satisfied with our lives forever. But we cannot. Choose Your Struggle If I ask you, “What do you want out of life?” and you say something like, “I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,” your response is so common and expected that it doesn’t really mean anything. Everybody enjoys what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy, and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when they walk into the room. Everybody wants that. It’s easy to want that. A more interesting question, a question that most people never consider, is, “What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?” Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. For example, most people want to get the corner office and make a boatload of money—but not many people want to suffer through sixty-hour workweeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, and arbitrary corporate hierarchies to escape the confines of an infinite cubicle hell. Most people want to have great sex and an awesome relationship, but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings, and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder, “What if?” for years and years, until the question morphs from “What if?” into “What else?” And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail, they say, “What for?” If not for their lowered standards and expectations twenty years prior, then what for? Because happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems. Joy doesn’t just sprout out of the ground like daisies and rainbows. Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles. Whether you suffer from anxiety or loneliness or obsessive-compulsive disorder or a dickhead boss who ruins half of your waking hours every day, the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience—not the avoidance of it, not the salvation from it. People want an amazing physique. But you don’t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that come with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate–sized portions. People want to start their own business. But you don’t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, the insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing. People want a partner, a spouse. But you don’t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It’s part of the game of love. You can’t win if you don’t play. What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame. You have to choose something. You can’t have a pain-free life. It can’t all be roses and unicorns all the time. Pleasure is the easy question. And pretty much all of us have a similar answer. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain? That’s the hard question that matters, the question that will actually get you somewhere. It’s the question that can change a perspective, a life. It’s what makes me, me, and you, you. It’s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together. For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician—a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage, playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling glory. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. For me, it was never a question of if I’d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I had it all planned out. I was simply biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of energy and effort into getting out there and making my mark. First I needed to finish school. Then I needed to make some extra money to buy gear. Then I needed to find enough free time to practice. Then I had to network and plan my first project. Then . . . and then nothing. Despite my fantasizing about this for over half my lifetime, the reality never came to fruition. And it took me a long time and a lot of struggle to finally figure out why: I didn’t actually want it. I was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I was playing—but I wasn’t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all. The daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit, the broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling forty pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit. The common cultural narratives would tell me that I somehow failed myself, that I’m a quitter or a loser, that I just didn’t “have it,” that I gave up on my dream and that maybe I let myself succumb to the pressures of society. But the truth is far less interesting than any of these explanations. The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn’t. End of story. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way. Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it. This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of “no pain, no gain.” This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems. See: it’s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.     CHAPTER 3 You Are Not Special I once knew a guy; we’ll call him Jimmy. Jimmy always had various business ventures going. On any given day, if you asked him what he was doing, he’d rattle off the name of some firm he was consulting with, or he’d describe a promising medical app he was looking for angel investors to fund, or he’d talk about some charity event he was supposed to be the keynote speaker for, or how he had an idea for a more efficient type of gas pump that was going to make him billions. The guy was always rolling, always on, and if you gave him an inch of conversational daylight, he’d pulverize you about how world-spinning his work was, how brilliant his latest ideas were, and he’d name-drop so much it felt like you were talking to a tabloid reporter. Jimmy was all positivity all the time. Always pushing himself, always working an angle—a real go-getter, whatever the fuck that means. The catch was that Jimmy was also a total deadbeat—all talk and no walk. Stoned a majority of the time, and spending as much money in bars and fine restaurants as he did on his “business ideas,” Jimmy was a professional leech, living off his family’s hard-won money by spinning them as well as everybody else in the city on false ideas of future tech glory. Sure, sometimes he’d put in some token effort, or pick up the phone and cold-call some bigwig and name-drop until he ran out of names, but nothing ever actually happened. None of these “ventures” ever blossomed into anything. Yet the guy kept this up for years, living off girlfriends and more and more distant relatives well into his late twenties. And the most screwed-up part was that Jimmy felt good about it. He had a delusional level of self-confidence. People who laughed at him or hung up on him were, in his mind, “missing the opportunity of their lives.” People who called him out on his bogus business ideas were “too ignorant and inexperienced” to understand his genius. People who pointed out his deadbeat lifestyle were “jealous”; they were “haters” who envied his success. Jimmy did make some money, although it was usually through the sketchiest of means, like selling another person’s business idea as his own, or finagling a loan from someone, or worse, talking someone into giving him equity in their start-up. He actually occasionally talked people into paying him to do some public speaking. (About what, I can’t even imagine.) The worst part was that Jimmy believed his own bullshit. His delusion was so bulletproof, it was honestly hard to get mad at him, it was actually kind of amazing. Sometime in the 1960s, developing “high self-esteem”—having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself—became all the rage in psychology. Research found that people who thought highly about themselves generally performed better and caused fewer problems. Many researchers and policymakers at the time came to believe that raising a population’s self-esteem could lead to some tangible social benefits: lower crime, better academic records, greater employment, lower budget deficits. As a result, beginning in the next decade, the 1970s, self-esteem practices began to be taught to parents, emphasized by therapists, politicians, and teachers, and instituted into educational policy. Grade inflation, for example, was implemented to make low-achieving kids feel better about their lack of achievement. Participation awards and bogus trophies were invented for any number of mundane and expected activities. Kids were given inane homework assignments, like writing down all the reasons why they thought they were special, or the five things they liked most about themselves. Pastors and ministers told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in God’s eyes, and were destined to excel and not be average. Business and motivational seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra: every single one of us can be exceptional and massively successful. But it’s a generation later and the data is in: we’re not all exceptional. It turns out that merely feeling good about yourself doesn’t really mean anything unless you have a good reason to feel good about yourself. It turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults. It turns out that teaching people to believe they’re exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what doesn’t lead to a population full of Bill Gateses and Martin Luther Kings. It leads to a population full of Jimmys. Jimmy, the delusional start-up founder. Jimmy, who smoked pot every day and had no real marketable skills other than talking himself up and believing it. Jimmy, the type of guy who yelled at his business partner for being “immature,” and then maxed out the company credit card at Le Bernardin trying to impress some Russian model. Jimmy, who was quickly running out of aunts and uncles who could loan him more money. Yes, that confident, high-self-esteem Jimmy. The Jimmy who spent so much time talking about how good he was that he forgot to, you know, actually do something. The problem with the self-esteem movement is that it measured self-esteem by how positively people felt about themselves. But a true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves. If a person like Jimmy feels absolutely fucking great 99.9 percent of the time, despite his life falling apart around him, then how can that be a valid metric for a successful and happy life? Jimmy is entitled. That is, he feels as though he deserves good things without actually earning them. He believes he should be able to be rich without actually working for it. He believes he should be liked and well-connected without actually helping anyone. He believes he should have an amazing lifestyle without actually sacrificing anything. People like Jimmy become so fixated on feeling good about themselves that they manage to delude themselves into believing that they are accomplishing great things even when they’re not. They believe they’re the brilliant presenter on stage when actually they’re making a fool of themselves. They believe they’re the successful start-up founder when, in fact, they’ve never had a successful venture. They call themselves life coaches and charge money to help others, even though they’re only twenty-five years old and haven’t actually accomplished anything substantial in their lives. Entitled people exude a delusional degree of self-confidence. This confidence can be alluring to others, at least for a little while. In some instances, the entitled person’s delusional level of confidence can become contagious and help the people around the entitled person feel more confident in themselves too. Despite all of Jimmy’s shenanigans, I have to admit that it was fun hanging out with him sometimes. You felt indestructible around him. But the problem with entitlement is that it makes people need to feel good about themselves all the time, even at the expense of those around them. And because entitled people always need to feel good about themselves, they end up spending most of their time thinking about themselves. After all, it takes a lot of energy and work to convince yourself that your shit doesn’t stink, especially when you’ve actually been living in a toilet. Once people have developed the thought pattern to constantly construe what happens around them as self-aggrandizing, it’s extremely hard to break them out of it. Any attempt to reason with them is seen as simply another “threat” to their superiority by another person who “can’t handle” how smart/talented/good-looking/successful they are. Entitlement closes in upon itself in a kind of narcissistic bubble, distorting anything and everything in such a way as to reinforce itself. People who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of, or a threat to, their own greatness. If something good happens to them, it’s because of some amazing feat they accomplished. If something bad happens to them, it’s because somebody is jealous and trying to bring them down a notch. Entitlement is impervious. People who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority. They keep their mental facade standing at all costs, even if it sometimes requires being physically or emotionally abusive to those around them. But entitlement is a failed strategy. It’s just another high. It’s not happiness. The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences. A person like Jimmy hides from his problems by making up imagined successes for himself at every turn. And because he can’t face his problems, no matter how good he feels about himself, he is weak. A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly—“Yes, sometimes I’m irresponsible with money,” “Yes, sometimes I exaggerate my own successes,” “Yes, I rely too much on others to support me and should be more self-reliant”—and then acts to improve upon them. But entitled people, because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way. They are left chasing high after high and accumulate greater and greater levels of denial. But eventually reality must hit, and the underlying problems will once again make themselves clear. It’s just a question of when, and how painful it will be. Things Fall Apart I sat in my 9:00 A.M. biology class, arms cradling my head on my desk as I stared at the clock’s second hand making laps, each tick syncopated with the teacher’s dronings-on about chromosomes and mitosis. Like most thirteen-year-olds stuck in a stuffy, fluorescent classroom, I was bored. A knock came on the door. Mr. Price, the school’s assistant principal, stuck his head in. “Excuse me for interrupting. Mark, can you step outside with me for a moment? Oh, and bring your things with you.” Strange, I thought. Kids get sent to the principal, but the principal rarely gets sent to them. I gathered my things and stepped out. The hallway was empty. Hundreds of beige lockers converged on the horizon. “Mark, can you take me to your locker, please?” “Sure,” I say, and slug myself down the hall, baggy jeans and moppy hair and oversized Pantera T-shirt and all. We get to my locker. “Open it, please,” Mr. Price says; so I do. He steps in front of me and gathers my coat, my gym bag, my backpack—all of the locker’s contents, minus a few notebooks and pencils. He starts walking away. “Come with me, please,” he says, without looking back. I start to get an uneasy feeling. I follow him to his office, where he asks me to sit down. He closes the door and locks it. He goes over to the window and adjusts the blinds to block the view from outside. My palms begin to sweat. This is not a normal principal visit. Mr. Price sits down and quietly rummages through my things, checking pockets, unzipping zippers, shaking out my gym clothes and placing them on the floor. Without looking up at me, Mr. Price asks, “Do you know what I’m looking for, Mark?” “No,” I say. “Drugs.” The word shocks me into nervous attention. “D-d-drugs?” I stammer. “What kind?” He looks at me sternly. “I don’t know; what kind do you have?” He opens one of my binders and checks the small pockets meant for pens. My sweat blossoms like a fungal growth. It spreads from my palms to my arms and now my neck. My temples pulsate as blood floods my brain and face. Like most thirteen-year-olds freshly accused of possessing narcotics and bringing them to school, I want to run away and hide. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I protest, the words sounding far meeker than I’d like. I feel as if I should be sounding confident in myself right now. Or maybe not. Maybe I should be scared. Do liars sound more scared or confident? Because however they sound, I want to sound the opposite. Instead, my lack of confidence compounds, unconfidence about my sounding unconfident making me more unconfident. That fucking Feedback Loop from Hell. “We’ll see about that,” he says, turning his attention to my backpack, which seemingly has one hundred pockets. Each is loaded with its own silly teen desiderata—colored pens, old notes passed in class, early-nineties CDs with cracked cases, dried-up markers, an old sketchpad with half its pages missing, dust and lint and crap accumulated during a maddeningly circuitous middle school existence. My sweat must be pumping at the speed of light, because time extends itself and dilates such that what is mere seconds on that 9:00 A.M. second-period biology clock now feels like Paleolithic eons, and I’m growing up and dying every minute. Just me and Mr. Price and my bottomless backpack. Somewhere around the Mesolithic Age, Mr. Price finishes searching the backpack. Having found nothing, he seems flustered. He turns the pack upside down and lets all of my crap crash onto his office floor. He’s now sweating as profusely as I am, except in place of my terror, there is his anger. “No drugs today, eh?” He tries to sound casual. “Nope.” So do I. He spreads my stuff out, separating each item and coagulating them into little piles beside my gym gear. My coat and backpack now lie empty and lifeless on his lap. He sighs and stares at the wall. Like most thirteen-year-olds locked in an office with a man angrily throwing their shit all over the floor, I want to cry. Mr. Price scans the contents organized on the floor. Nothing illicit or illegal, no narcotics, not even anything against school policy. He sighs and then throws the coat and backpack on the floor too. He bends over and puts his elbows on his knees, making his face level with mine. “Mark, I’m going to give you one last chance to be honest with me. If you are honest, this will turn out much better for you. If it turns out you’re lying, then it’s going to be much worse.” As if on cue, I gulp. “Now tell me the truth,” Mr. Price demands. “Did you bring drugs to school today?” Fighting back tears, screams clawing at my throat, I stare my tormentor in the face and, in a pleading voice, dying to be relieved of its adolescent horrors, I say, “No, I don’t have any drugs. I have no idea what you’re talking about.” “Okay,” he says, signaling surrender. “I guess you can collect your things and go.” He takes one last, longing gaze at my deflated backpack, lying like a broken promise there on his office floor. He casually puts one foot down on the pack, stomping lightly, a last-ditch effort. I anxiously wait for him to get up and leave so I can get on with my life and forget this whole nightmare. But his foot stops on something. “What is this?” he asks, tapping with his foot. “What is what?” I say. “There’s still something in here.” He picks up the bag and starts feeling around the bottom of it. For me the room gets fuzzy; everything goes wobbly. When I was young, I was smart. I was friendly. But I was also a shithead. I mean that in the most loving way possible. I was a rebellious, lying little shithead. Angry and full of resentment. When I was twelve, I hacked my house’s security system with refrigerator magnets so I could sneak out undetected in the middle of the night. My friend and I would put his mom’s car in neutral and push it into the street so we could drive around without waking her up. I would write papers about abortion because I knew my English teacher was a hardcore conservative Christian. Another friend and I stole cigarettes from his mom and sold them to kids out behind the school. And I also cut a secret compartment into the bottom of my backpack to hide my marijuana. That was the same hidden compartment Mr. Price found after stepping on the drugs I was hiding. I had been lying. And, as promised, Mr. Price didn’t go easy on me. A few hours later, like most thirteen-year-olds handcuffed in the back of a police car, I thought my life was over. And I was kind of right, in a way. My parents quarantined me at home. I was to have no friends for the foreseeable future. Having been expelled from school, I was to be homeschooled for the rest of the year. My mom made me get a haircut and threw out all of my Marilyn Manson and Metallica shirts (which, for an adolescent in 1998, was tantamount to being sentenced to death by lameness). My dad dragged me to his office with him in the mornings and made me file papers for hours on end. Once homeschooling was over, I was enrolled in a small, private Christian school, where—and this may not surprise you—I didn’t exactly fit in. And just when I had finally cleaned up my act and turned in my assignments and learned the value of good clerical responsibility, my parents decided to get divorced. I tell you all of this only to point out that my adolescence sucked donkey balls. I lost all of my friends, my community, my legal rights, and my family within the span of about nine months. My therapist in my twenties would later call this “some real traumatic shit,” and I would spend the next decade-and-change working on unraveling it and becoming less of a self-absorbed, entitled little prick. The problem with my home life back then was not all of the horrible things that were said or done; rather, it was all of the horrible things that needed to be said and done but weren’t. My family stonewalls the way Warren Buffett makes money or Jenna Jameson fucks: we’re champions at it. The house could have been burning down around us and it would have been met with, “Oh no, everything’s fine. A tad warm in here, perhaps—but really, everything’s fine.” When my parents got divorced, there were no broken dishes, no slammed doors, no screaming arguments about who fucked whom. Once they had reassured my brother and me that it wasn’t our fault, we had a Q&A session—yes, you read that right—about the logistics of the new living arrangements. Not a tear was shed. Not a voice was raised. The closest peek my brother and I got into our parents’ unraveling emotional lives was hearing, “Nobody cheated on anybody.” Oh, that’s nice. It was a tad warm in the room, but really, everything was fine. My parents are good people. I don’t blame them for any of this (not anymore, at least). And I love them very much. They have their own stories and their own journeys and their own problems, just as all parents do. And just as all of their parents do, and so on. And like all parents, my parents, with the best of intentions, imparted some of their problems to me, as I probably will to my kids. When “real traumatic shit” like this happens in our lives, we begin to unconsciously feel as though we have problems that we’re incapable of ever solving. And this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless. But it also causes something else to happen. If we have problems that are unsolvable, our unconscious figures that we’re either uniquely special or uniquely defective in some way. That we’re somehow unlike everyone else and that the rules must be different for us. Put simply: we become entitled. The pain from my adolescence led me down a road of entitlement that lasted through much of my early adulthood. Whereas Jimmy’s entitlement played out in the business world, where he pretended to be a huge success, my entitlement played out in my relationships, particularly with women. My trauma had revolved around intimacy and acceptance, so I felt a constant need to overcompensate, to prove to myself that I was loved and accepted at all times. And as a result, I soon took to chasing women the same way a cocaine addict takes to a snowman made out of cocaine: I made sweet love to it, and then promptly suffocated myself in it. I became a player—an immature, selfish, albeit sometimes charming player. And I strung up a long series of superficial and unhealthy relationships for the better part of a decade. It wasn’t so much the sex I craved, although the sex was fun. It was the validation. I was wanted; I was loved; for the first time since I could remember, I was worthy. My craving for validation quickly fed into a mental habit of self-aggrandizing and overindulgence. I felt entitled to say or do whatever I wanted, to break people’s trust, to ignore people’s feelings, and then justify it later with shitty, half-assed apologies. While this period certainly had its moments of fun and excitement, and I met some wonderful women, my life was more or less a wreck the whole time. I was often unemployed, living on friends’ couches or with my mom, drinking way more than I should have been, alienating a number of friends—and when I did meet a woman I really liked, my self-absorption quickly torpedoed everything. The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems. This entitlement plays out in one of two ways: 1.   I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 2.   I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment. Opposite mindset on the outside, but the same selfish creamy core in the middle. In fact, you will often see entitled people flip back and forth between the two. Either they’re on top of the world or the world is on top of them, depending on the day of the week, or how well they’re doing with their particular addiction at that moment. Most people correctly identify a person like Jimmy as a raging narcissistic ass-hat. That’s because he’s pretty blatant in his delusionally high self-regard. What most people don’t correctly identify as entitlement are those people who perpetually feel as though they’re inferior and unworthy of the world. Because construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimized requires just as much selfishness as the opposite. It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all. The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn’t minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn’t hurt. It doesn’t mean you aren’t legitimately a victim in some circumstances. It just means that you’re not special. Often, it’s this realization—that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain—that is the first and most important step toward solving them. But for some reason, it appears that more and more people, particularly young people, are forgetting this. Numerous professors and educators have noted a lack of emotional resilience and an excess of selfish demands in today’s young people. It’s not uncommon now for books to be removed from a class’s curriculum for no other reason than that they made someone feel bad. Speakers and professors are shouted down and banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some Halloween costumes really aren’t that offensive. School counselors note that more students than ever are exhibiting severe signs of emotional distress over what are otherwise run-of-the-mill daily college experiences, such as an argument with a roommate, or getting a low grade in a class. It’s strange that in an age when we are more connected than ever, entitlement seems to be at an all-time high. Something about recent technology seems to allow our insecurities to run amok like never before. The more freedom we’re given to express ourselves, the more we want to be free of having to deal with anyone who may disagree with us or upset us. The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist. The easier and more problem-free our lives become, the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better. The benefits of the Internet and social media are unquestionably fantastic. In many ways, this is the best time in history to be alive. But perhaps these technologies are having some unintended social side effects. Perhaps these same technologies that have liberated and educated so many are simultaneously enabling people’s sense of entitlement more than ever before. The Tyranny of Exceptionalism Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you’re exceptional at one thing, chances are you’re average or below average at most other things. That’s just the nature of life. To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it. And because we all have limited time and energy, few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing, if anything at all. We can then say that it’s a statistical improbability that any single person will be an extraordinary performer in all areas of life, or even in many areas of their life. Brilliant businesspeople are often fuckups in their personal lives. Extraordinary athletes are often shallow and as dumb as a lobotomized rock. Many celebrities are probably just as clueless about life as the people who gawk at them and follow their every move. We’re all, for the most part, pretty average people. But it’s the extremes that get all of the publicity. We kind of know this already, but we rarely think and/or talk about it, and we certainly never discuss why this could be a problem. Having the Internet, Google, Facebook, YouTube, and access to five hundred–plus channels of television is amazing. But our attention is limited. There’s no way we can process the tidal waves of information flowing past us constantly. Therefore, the only zeroes and ones that break through and catch our attention are the truly exceptional pieces of information—those in the 99.999th percentile. All day, every day, we are flooded with the truly extraordinary. The best of the best. The worst of the worst. The greatest physical feats. The funniest jokes. The most upsetting news. The scariest threats. Nonstop. Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience, because in the media business that’s what gets eyeballs, and eyeballs bring dollars. That’s the bottom line. Yet the vast majority of life resides in the humdrum middle. The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average. This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. And because we’re all quite average most of the time, the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate, because clearly we are somehow not good enough. So more and more we feel the need to compensate through entitlement and addiction. We cope the only way we know how: either through self-aggrandizing or through other-aggrandizing. Some of us do this by cooking up get-rich-quick schemes. Others do it by taking off across the world to save starving babies in Africa. Others do it by excelling in school and winning every award. Others do it by shooting up a school. Others do it by trying to have sex with anything that talks and breathes. This ties in to the growing culture of entitlement that I talked about earlier. Millennials often get blamed for this cultural shift, but that’s likely because millennials are the most plugged-in and visible generation. In fact, the tendency toward entitlement is apparent across all of society. And I believe it’s linked to mass-media-driven exceptionalism. The problem is that the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing is screwing up a lot of people’s expectations for themselves. The inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves, makes them feel that they need to be more extreme, more radical, and more self-assured to get noticed or even matter. When I was a young man, my insecurities around intimacy were exacerbated by all the ridiculous narratives of masculinity circulating throughout pop culture. And those same narratives are still circulating: to be a cool guy, you have to party like a rock star; to be respected, you have to be admired by women; sex is the most valuable thing a man can attain, and it’s worth sacrificing anything (including your own dignity) to get it. This constant stream of unrealistic media dogpiles onto our existing feelings of insecurity, by overexposing us to the unrealistic standards we fail to live up to. Not only do we feel subjected to unsolvable problems, but we feel like losers because a simple Google search shows us thousands of people without those same problems. Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame. B-b-b-but, If I’m Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What’s the Point? It has become an accepted part of our culture today to believe that we are all destined to do something truly extraordinary. Celebrities say it. Business tycoons say it. Politicians say it. Even Oprah says it (so it must be true). Each and every one of us can be extraordinary. We all deserve greatness. The fact that this statement is inherently contradictory—after all, if everyone were extraordinary, then by definition no one would be extraordinary—is missed by most people. And instead of questioning what we actually deserve or don’t deserve, we eat the message up and ask for more. Being “average” has become the new standard of failure. The worst thing you can be is in the middle of the pack, the middle of the bell curve. When a culture’s standard of success is to “be extraordinary,” it then becomes better to be at the extreme low end of the bell curve than to be in the middle, because at least there you’re still special and deserve attention. Many people choose this strategy: to prove to everyone that they are the most miserable, or the most oppressed, or the most victimized. A lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it, they’ll never achieve anything, never improve, and that their life won’t matter. This sort of thinking is dangerous. Once you accept the premise that a life is worthwhile only if it is truly notable and great, then you basically accept the fact that most of the human population (including yourself) sucks and is worthless. And this mindset can quickly turn dangerous, to both yourself and others. The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better. All of this “every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness” stuff is basically just jerking off your ego. It’s a message that tastes good going down, but in reality is nothing more than empty calories that make you emotionally fat and bloated, the proverbial Big Mac for your heart and your brain. The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies—that is, accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: truths such as “Your actions actually don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of things” and “The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay.” This vegetable course will taste bad at first. Very bad. You will avoid accepting it. But once ingested, your body will wake up feeling more potent and more alive. After all, that constant pressure to be something amazing, to be the next big thing, will be lifted off your back. The stress and anxiety of always feeling inadequate and constantly needing to prove yourself will dissipate. And the knowledge and acceptance of your own mundane existence will actually free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish, without judgment or lofty expectations. You will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. Sounds boring, doesn’t it? That’s because these things are ordinary. But maybe they’re ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matters.     CHAPTER 4 The Value of Suffering In the closing months of 1944, after almost a decade of war, the tide was turning against Japan. Their economy was floundering, their military overstretched across half of Asia, and the territories they had won throughout the Pacific were now toppling like dominoes to U.S. forces. Defeat seemed inevitable. On December 26, 1944, Second Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda of the Japanese Imperial Army was deployed to the small island of Lubang in the Philippines. His orders were to slow the United States’ progress as much as possible, to stand and fight at all costs, and to never surrender. Both he and his commander knew it was essentially a suicide mission. In February 1945, the Americans arrived on Lubang and took the island with overwhelming force. Within days, most of the Japanese soldiers had either surrendered or been killed, but Onoda and three of his men managed to hide in the jungle. From there, they began a guerrilla warfare campaign against the U.S. forces and the local population, attacking supply lines, shooting at stray soldiers, and interfering with the American forces in any way that they could. That August, half a year later, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered, and the deadliest war in human history came to its dramatic conclusion. However, thousands of Japanese soldiers were still scattered among the Pacific isles, and most, like Onoda, were hiding in the jungle, unaware that the war was over. These holdouts continued to fight and pillage as they had before. This was a real problem for rebuilding eastern Asia after the war, and the governments agreed something must be done. The U.S. military, in conjunction with the Japanese government, dropped thousands of leaflets throughout the Pacific region, announcing that the war was over and it was time for everyone to go home. Onoda and his men, like many others, found and read these leaflets, but unlike most of the others, Onoda decided that they were fake, a trap set by the American forces to get the guerrilla fighters to show themselves. Onoda burned the leaflets, and he and his men stayed hidden and continued to fight. Five years went by. The leaflets had stopped, and most of the American forces had long since gone home. The local population on Lubang attempted to return to their normal lives of farming and fishing. Yet there were Hiroo Onoda and his merry men, still shooting at the farmers, burning their crops, stealing their livestock, and murdering locals who wandered too far into the jungle. The Philippine government then took to drawing up new flyers and spreading them out across the jungle. Come out, they said. The war is over. You lost. But these, too, were ignored. In 1952, the Japanese government made one final effort to draw the last remaining soldiers out of hiding throughout the Pacific. This time, letters and pictures from the missing soldiers’ families were air-dropped, along with a personal note from the emperor himself. Once again, Onoda refused to believe that the information was real. Once again, he believed the airdrop to be a trick by the Americans. Once again, he and his men stood and continued to fight. Another few years went by and the Philippine locals, sick of being terrorized, finally armed themselves and began firing back. By 1959, one of Onoda’s companions had surrendered, and another had been killed. Then, a decade later, Onoda’s last companion, a man called Kozuka, was killed in a shootout with the local police while he was burning rice fields—still waging war against the local population a full quarter-century after the end of World War II! Onoda, having now spent more than half of his life in the jungles of Lubang, was all alone. In 1972, the news of Kozuka’s death reached Japan and caused a stir. The Japanese people thought the last of the soldiers from the war had come home years earlier. The Japanese media began to wonder: if Kozuka had still been on Lubang until 1972, then perhaps Onoda himself, the last known Japanese holdout from World War II, might still be alive as well. That year, both the Japanese and Philippine governments sent search parties to look for the enigmatic second lieutenant, now part myth, part hero, and part ghost. They found nothing. As the months progressed, the story of Lieutenant Onoda morphed into something of an urban legend in Japan—the war hero who sounded too insane to actually exist. Many romanticized him. Others criticized him. Others thought he was the stuff of fairy tale, invented by those who still wanted to believe in a Japan that had disappeared long ago. It was around this time that a young man named Norio Suzuki first heard of Onoda. Suzuki was an adventurer, an explorer, and a bit of a hippie. Born after the war ended, he had dropped out of school and spent four years hitchhiking his way across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, sleeping on park benches, in stranger’s cars, in jail cells, and under the stars. He volunteered on farms for food, and donated blood to pay for places to stay. He was a free spirit, and perhaps a little bit nuts. In 1972, Suzuki needed another adventure. He had returned to Japan after his travels and found the strict cultural norms and social hierarchy to be stifling. He hated school. He couldn’t hold down a job. He wanted to be back on the road, back on his own again. For Suzuki, the legend of Hiroo Onoda came as the answer to his problems. It was a new and worthy adventure for him to pursue. Suzuki believed that he would be the one who would find Onoda. Sure, search parties conducted by the Japanese, Philippine, and American governments had not been able to find Onoda; local police forces had been scavenging the jungle for almost thirty years with no luck; thousands of leaflets had met with no response—but fuck it, this deadbeat, college-dropout hippie was going to be the one to find him. Unarmed and untrained for any sort of reconnaissance or tactical warfare, Suzuki traveled to Lubang and began wandering around the jungle all by himself. His strategy: scream Onoda’s name really loudly and tell him that the emperor was worried about him. He found Onoda in four days. Suzuki stayed with Onoda in the jungle for some time. Onoda had been alone by that point for over a year, and once found by Suzuki he welcomed the companionship and was desperate to learn what had been happening in the outside world from a Japanese source he could trust. The two men became sorta-kinda friends. Suzuki asked Onoda why he had stayed and continued to fight. Onoda said it was simple: he had been given the order to “never surrender,” so he stayed. For nearly thirty years he had simply been following an order. Onoda then asked Suzuki why a “hippie boy” like himself came looking for him. Suzuki said that he’d left Japan in search of three things: “Lieutenant Onoda, a panda bear, and the Abominable Snowman, in that order.” The two men had been brought together under the most curious of circumstances: two well-intentioned adventurers chasing false visions of glory, like a real-life Japanese Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, stuck together in the damp recesses of a Philippine jungle, both imagining themselves heroes, despite both being alone with nothing, doing nothing. Onoda had already by then given up most of his life to a phantom war. Suzuki would give his up too. Having already found Hiroo Onoda and the panda bear, he would die a few years later in the Himalayas, still in search of the Abominable Snowman. Humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes. On the surface, these causes make no sense. It’s hard to imagine how Onoda could have been happy on that island for those thirty years—living off insects and rodents, sleeping in the dirt, murdering civilians decade after decade. Or why Suzuki trekked off to his own death, with no money, no companions, and no purpose other than to chase an imaginary Yeti. Yet, later in his life, Onoda said he regretted nothing. He claimed that he was proud of his choices and his time on Lubang. He said that it had been an honor to devote a sizable portion of his life in service to a nonexistent empire. Suzuki, had he survived, likely would have said something similar: that he was doing exactly what he was meant to do, that he regretted nothing. These men both chose how they wished to suffer. Hiroo Onoda chose to suffer for loyalty to a dead empire. Suzuki chose to suffer for adventure, no matter how ill-advised. To both men, their suffering meant something; it fulfilled some greater cause. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it. If suffering is inevitable, if our problems in life are unavoidable, then the question we should be asking is not “How do I stop suffering?” but “Why am I suffering—for what purpose?” Hiroo Onoda returned to Japan in 1974 and became a kind of celebrity in his home country. He was shuttled around from talk show to radio station; politicians clamored to shake his hand; he published a book and was even offered a large sum of money by the government. But what he found when he returned to Japan horrified him: a consumerist, capitalist, superficial culture that had lost all of the traditions of honor and sacrifice upon which his generation had been raised. Onoda tried to use his sudden celebrity to espouse the values of Old Japan, but he was tone-deaf to this new society. He was seen more as a showpiece than as a serious cultural thinker—a Japanese man who had emerged from a time capsule for all to marvel at, like a relic in a museum. And in the irony of ironies, Onoda became far more depressed than he’d ever been in the jungle for all those years. At least in the jungle his life had stood for something; it had meant something. That had made his suffering endurable, indeed even a little bit desirable. But back in Japan, in what he considered to be a vacuous nation full of hippies and loose women in Western clothing, he was confronted with the unavoidable truth: that his fighting had meant nothing. The Japan he had lived and fought for no longer existed. And the weight of this realization pierced him in a way that no bullet ever had. Because his suffering had meant nothing, it suddenly became realized and true: thirty years wasted. And so, in 1980, Onoda packed up and moved to Brazil, where he remained until he died. The Self-Awareness Onion Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times. Let’s say the first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. “This is when I feel happy.” “This makes me feel sad.” “This gives me hope.” Unfortunately, there are many people who suck at even this most basic level of self-awareness. I know because I’m one of them. My wife and I sometimes have a fun back-and-forth that goes something like this: HER. What’s wrong? ME. Nothing’s wrong. Nothing at all. HER. No, something’s wrong. Tell me. ME. I’m fine. Really. HER. Are you sure? You look upset. ME, with nervous laughter. Really? No, I’m okay, seriously. [Thirty minutes later . . . ] ME. . . . And that’s why I’m so fucking pissed off! He just acts as if I don’t exist half the time. We all have emotional blind spots. Often they have to do with the emotions that we were taught were inappropriate growing up. It takes years of practice and effort to get good at identifying blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately. But this task is hugely important, and worth the effort. The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions. These why questions are difficult and often take months or even years to answer consistently and accurately. Most people need to go to some sort of therapist just to hear these questions asked for the first time. Such questions are important because they illuminate what we consider success or failure. Why do you feel angry? Is it because you failed to achieve some goal? Why do you feel lethargic and uninspired? Is it because you don’t think you’re good enough? This layer of questioning helps us understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change it. But there’s another, even deeper level of the self-awareness onion. And that one is full of fucking tears. The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me? This level, which takes constant questioning and effort, is incredibly difficult to reach. But it’s the most important, because our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives. Values underlie everything we are and do. If what we value is unhelpful, if what we consider success/failure is poorly chosen, then everything based upon those values—the thoughts, the emotions, the day-to-day feelings—will all be out of whack. Everything we think and feel about a situation ultimately comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be. Most people are horrible at answering these why questions accurately, and this prevents them from achieving a deeper knowledge of their own values. Sure, they may say they value honesty and a true friend, but then they turn around and lie about you behind your back to make themselves feel better. People may perceive that they feel lonely. But when they ask themselves why they feel lonely, they tend to come up with a way to blame others—everyone else is mean, or no one is cool or smart enough to understand them—and thus they further avoid their problem instead of seeking to solve it. For many people this passes as self-awareness. And yet, if they were able to go deeper and look at their underlying values, they would see that their original analysis was based on avoiding responsibility for their own problem, rather than accurately identifying the problem. They would see that their decisions were based on chasing highs, not generating true happiness. Most self-help gurus ignore this deeper level of self-awareness as well. They take people who are miserable because they want to be rich, and then give them all sorts of advice on how to make more money, all the while ignoring important values-based questions: Why do they feel such a need to be rich in the first place? How are they choosing to measure success/failure for themselves? Is it not perhaps some particular value that’s the root cause of their unhappiness, and not the fact that they don’t drive a Bentley yet? Much of the advice out there operates at a shallow level of simply trying to make people feel good in the short term, while the real long-term problems never get solved. People’s perceptions and feelings may change, but the underlying values, and the metrics by which those values are assessed, stay the same. This is not real progress. This is just another way to achieve more highs. Honest self-questioning is difficult. It requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer. In fact, in my experience, the more uncomfortable the answer, the more likely it is to be true. Take a moment and think of something that’s really bugging you. Now ask yourself why it bugs you. Chances are the answer will involve a failure of some sort. Then take that failure and ask why it seems “true” to you. What if that failure wasn’t really a failure? What if you’ve been looking at it the wrong way? A recent example from my own life: “It bugs me that my brother doesn’t return my texts or emails.” Why? “Because it feels like he doesn’t give a shit about me.” Why does this seem true? “Because if he wanted to have a relationship with me, he would take ten seconds out of his day to interact with me.” Why does his lack of relationship with you feel like a failure? “Because we’re brothers; we’re supposed to have a good relationship!” Two things are operating here: a value that I hold dear, and a metric that I use to assess progress toward that value. My value: brothers are supposed to have a good relationship with one another. My metric: being in contact by phone or email—this is how I measure my success as a brother. By holding on to this metric, I make myself feel like a failure, which occasionally ruins my Saturday mornings. We could dig even deeper, by repeating the process: Why are brothers supposed to have a good relationship? “Because they’re family, and family are supposed to be close!” Why does that seem true? “Because your family is supposed to matter to you more than anyone else!” Why does that seem true? “Because being close with your family is ‘normal’ and ‘healthy,’ and I don’t have that.” In this exchange I’m clear about my underlying value—having a good relationship with my brother—but I’m still struggling with my metric. I’ve given it another name, “closeness,” but the metric hasn’t really changed: I’m still judging myself as a brother based on frequency of contact—and comparing myself, using that metric, against other people I know. Everyone else (or so it seems) has a close relationship with their family members, and I don’t. So obviously there must be something wrong with me. But what if I’m choosing a poor metric for myself and my life? What else could be true that I’m not considering? Well, perhaps I don’t need to be close to my brother to have that good relationship that I value. Perhaps there just needs to be some mutual respect (which there is). Or maybe mutual trust is what to look for (and it’s there). Perhaps these metrics would be better assessments of brotherhood than how many text messages he and I exchange. This clearly makes sense; it feels true for me. But it still fucking hurts that my brother and I aren’t close. And there’s no positive way to spin it. There’s no secret way to glorify myself through this knowledge. Sometimes brothers—even brothers who love each other—don’t have close relationships, and that’s fine. It is hard to accept at first, but that’s fine. What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it. Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them. Rock Star Problems In 1983, a talented young guitarist was kicked out of his band in the worst possible way. The band had just been signed to a record deal, and they were about to record their first album. But a couple days before recording began, the band showed the guitarist the door—no warning, no discussion, no dramatic blowout; they literally woke him up one day by handing him a bus ticket home. As he sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York, the guitarist kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now? Record contracts didn’t exactly fall out of the sky, especially for raucous, upstart metal bands. Had he missed his one and only shot? But by the time the bus hit L.A., the guitarist had gotten over his self-pity and had vowed to start a new band. He decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision. He would become so famous that they would be subjected to decades of seeing him on TV, hearing him on the radio, seeing posters of him in the streets and pictures of him in magazines. They’d be flipping burgers somewhere, loading vans from their shitty club gigs, fat and drunk with their ugly wives, and he’d be rocking out in front of stadium crowds live on television. He’d bathe in the tears of his betrayers, each tear wiped dry by a crisp, clean hundred-dollar bill. And so the guitarist worked as if possessed by a musical demon. He spent months recruiting the best musicians he could find—far better musicians than his previous bandmates. He wrote dozens of songs and practiced religiously. His seething anger fueled his ambition; revenge became his muse. Within a couple years, his new band had signed a record deal of their own, and a year after that, their first record would go gold. The guitarist’s name was Dave Mustaine, and the new band he formed was the legendary heavy-metal band Megadeth. Megadeth would go on to sell over 25 million albums and tour the world many times over. Today, Mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavy-metal music. Unfortunately, the band he was kicked out of was Metallica, which has sold over 180 million albums worldwide. Metallica is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock bands of all time. And because of this, in a rare intimate interview in 2003, a tearful Mustaine admitted that he couldn’t help but still consider himself a failure. Despite all that he had accomplished, in his mind he would always be the guy who got kicked out of Metallica. We’re apes. We think we’re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we’re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves? Dave Mustaine, whether he realized it or not, chose to measure himself by whether he was more successful and popular than Metallica. The experience of getting thrown out of his former band was so painful for him that he adopted “success relative to Metallica” as the metric by which to measure himself and his music career. Despite taking a horrible event in his life and making something positive out of it, as Mustaine did with Megadeth, his choice to hold on to Metallica’s success as his life-defining metric continued to hurt him decades later. Despite all the money and the fans and the accolades, he still considered himself a failure. Now, you and I may look at Dave Mustaine’s situation and laugh. Here’s this guy with millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of adoring fans, a career doing the thing he loves best, and still he’s getting all weepy-eyed that his rock star buddies from twenty years ago are way more famous than he is. This is because you and I have different values than Mustaine does, and we measure ourselves by different metrics. Our metrics are probably more like “I don’t want to work a job for a boss I hate,” or “I’d like to earn enough money to send my kid to a good school,” or “I’d be happy to not wake up in a drainage ditch.” And by these metrics, Mustaine is wildly, unimaginably successful. But by his metric, “Be more popular and successful than Metallica,” he’s a failure. Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else. Onoda’s value of loyalty to the Japanese empire is what sustained him on Lubang for almost thirty years. But this same value is also what made him miserable upon his return to Japan. Mustaine’s metric of being better than Metallica likely helped him launch an incredibly successful music career. But that same metric later tortured him in spite of his success. If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success. As an example, let’s look at another musician who got kicked out of another band. His story eerily echoes that of Dave Mustaine, although it happened two decades earlier. It was 1962 and there was a buzz around an up-and-coming band from Liverpool, England. This band had funny haircuts and an even funnier name, but their music was undeniably good, and the record industry was finally taking notice. There was John, the lead singer and songwriter; Paul, the boyish-faced romantic bass player; George, the rebellious lead guitar player. And then there was the drummer. He was considered the best-looking of the bunch—the girls all went wild for him, and it was his face that began to appear in the magazines first. He was the most professional member of the group too. He didn’t do drugs. He had a steady girlfriend. There were even a few people in suits and ties who thought he should be the face of the band, not John or Paul. His name was Pete Best. And in 1962, after landing their first record contract, the other three members of the Beatles quietly got together and asked their manager, Brian Epstein, to fire him. Epstein agonized over the decision. He liked Pete, so he put it off, hoping the other three guys would change their minds. Months later, a mere three days before the recording of the first record began, Epstein finally called Best to his office. There, the manager unceremoniously told him to piss off and find another band. He gave no reason, no explanation, no condolences—just told him that the other guys wanted him out of the group, so, uh, best of luck. As a replacement, the band brought in some oddball named Ringo Starr. Ringo was older and had a big, funny nose. Ringo agreed to get the same ugly haircut as John, Paul, and George, and insisted on writing songs about octopuses and submarines. The other guys said, Sure, fuck it, why not? Within six months of Best’s firing, Beatlemania had erupted, making John, Paul, George, and Pete Ringo arguably four of the most famous faces on the entire planet. Meanwhile, Best understandably fell into a deep depression and spent a lot of time doing what any Englishman will do if you give him a reason to: drink. The rest of the sixties were not kind to Pete Best. By 1965, he had sued two of the Beatles for slander, and all of his other musical projects had failed horribly. In 1968, he attempted suicide, only to be talked out of it by his mother. His life was a wreck. Best didn’t have the same redemptive story Dave Mustaine did. He never became a global superstar or made millions of dollars. Yet, in many ways, Best ended up better off than Mustaine. In an interview in 1994, Best said, “I’m happier than I would have been with the Beatles.” What the hell? Best explained that the circumstances of his getting kicked out of the Beatles ultimately led him to meet his wife. And then his marriage led him to having children. His values changed. He began to measure his life differently. Fame and glory would have been nice, sure—but he decided that what he already had was more important: a big and loving family, a stable marriage, a simple life. He even still got to play drums, touring Europe and recording albums well into the 2000s. So what was really lost? Just a lot of attention and adulation, whereas what was gained meant so much more to him. These stories suggest that some values and metrics are better than others. Some lead to good problems that are easily and regularly solved. Others lead to bad problems that are not easily and regularly solved. Shitty Values There are a handful of common values that create really poor problems for people—problems that can hardly be solved. So let’s go over some of them quickly: 1.   Pleasure. Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life around. Ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out. Ask an adulterer who shattered her family and lost her children whether pleasure ultimately made her happy. Ask a man who almost ate himself to death how pleasure helped him solve his problems.  Pleasure is a false god. Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.  And yet, pleasure is what’s marketed to us, twenty-four/seven. It’s what we fixate on. It’s what we use to numb and distract ourselves. But pleasure, while necessary in life (in certain doses), isn’t, by itself, sufficient.  Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather, it is the effect. If you get the other stuff right (the other values and metrics), then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product. 2.   Material Success. Many people measure their self-worth based on how much money they make or what kind of car they drive or whether their front lawn is greener and prettier than the next-door neighbor’s.  Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. So if you’re starving and living on the street in the middle of India, an extra ten thousand dollars a year would affect your happiness a lot. But if you’re sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country, an extra ten thousand dollars per year won’t affect anything much—meaning that you’re killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing.  The other issue with overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence, and compassion. When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well. 3.   Always Being Right.Our brains are inefficient machines. We consistently make poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities, misremember facts, give in to cognitive biases, and make decisions based on our emotional whims. As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right—well, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself. The fact is, people who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. They lack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others. They close themselves off to new and important information. It’s far more helpful to assume that you’re ignorant and don’t know a whole lot. This keeps you unattached to superstitious or poorly informed beliefs and promotes a constant state of learning and growth. 4.   Staying Positive. Then there are those who measure their lives by the ability to be positive about, well, pretty much everything. Lost your job? Great! That’s an opportunity to explore your passions. Husband cheated on you with your sister? Well, at least you’re learning what you really mean to the people around you. Child dying of throat cancer? At least you don’t have to pay for college anymore! While there is something to be said for “staying on the sunny side of life,” the truth is, sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it. Denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems—problems which, by the way, if you’re choosing the right values and metrics, should be invigorating you and motivating you. It’s simple, really: things go wrong, people upset us, accidents happen. These things make us feel like shit. And that’s fine. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health. To deny that negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solve them. The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values. Simple example: A value of mine is nonviolence. Therefore, when I get mad at somebody, I express that anger, but I also make a point of not punching them in the face. Radical idea, I know. But the anger is not the problem. Anger is natural. Anger is a part of life. Anger is arguably quite healthy in many situations. (Remember, emotions are just feedback.) See, it’s the punching people in the face that’s the problem. Not the anger. The anger is merely the messenger for my fist in your face. Don’t blame the messenger. Blame my fist (or your face). When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life’s problems. And when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness. Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life. Thus to duck our problems is to lead a meaningless (even if supposedly pleasant) existence. In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer. These activities are stressful, arduous, and often unpleasant. They also require withstanding problem after problem. Yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joyous things we’ll ever do. They involve pain, struggle, even anger and despair—yet once they’re accomplished, we look back and get all misty-eyed telling our grandkids about them. As Freud once said, “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.” This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive. The point is to nail down some good values and metrics, and pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result. These things are side effects of good values. By themselves, they are empty highs. Defining Good and Bad Values Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable. Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it’s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that’s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don’t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won’t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn’t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.) Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. Some examples of bad, unhealthy values: dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich, sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods. You’ll notice that good, healthy values are achieved internally. Something like creativity or humility can be experienced right now. You simply have to orient your mind in a certain way to experience it. These values are immediate and controllable and engage you with the world as it is rather than how you wish it were. Bad values are generally reliant on external events—flying in a private jet, being told you’re right all the time, owning a house in the Bahamas, eating a cannoli while getting blown by three strippers. Bad values, while sometimes fun or pleasurable, lie outside of your control and often require socially destructive or superstitious means to achieve. Values are about prioritization. Everybody would love a good cannoli or a house in the Bahamas. The question is your priorities. What are the values that you prioritize above everything else, and that therefore influence your decision-making more than anything else? Hiroo Onoda’s highest value was complete loyalty and service to the Japanese empire. This value, in case you couldn’t tell from reading about him, stank worse than a rotten sushi roll. It created really shitty problems for Hiroo—namely, he got stuck on a remote island where he lived off bugs and worms for thirty years. Oh, and he felt compelled to murder innocent civilians too. So despite the fact that Hiroo saw himself as a success, and despite the fact he lived up to his metrics, I think we can all agree that his life really sucked—none of us would trade shoes with him given the opportunity, nor would we commend his actions. Dave Mustaine achieved great fame and glory and felt like a failure anyway. This is because he’d adopted a crappy value based on some arbitrary comparison to the success of others. This value gave him awful problems such as, “I need to sell 150 million more records; then everything will be great,” and “My next tour needs to be nothing but stadiums”—problems he thought he needed to solve in order to be happy. It’s no surprise that he wasn’t. On the contrary, Pete Best pulled a switcheroo. Despite being depressed and distraught by getting kicked out of the Beatles, as he grew older he learned to reprioritize what he cared about and was able to measure his life in a new light. Because of this, Best grew into a happy and healthy old man, with an easy life and great family—things that, ironically, the four Beatles would spend decades struggling to achieve or maintain. When we have poor values—that is, poor standards we set for ourselves and others—we are essentially giving fucks about the things that don’t matter, things that in fact make our life worse. But when we choose better values, we are able to divert our fucks to something better—toward things that matter, things that improve the state of our well-being and that generate happiness, pleasure, and success as side effects. This, in a nutshell, is what “self-improvement” is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life. The rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. All follow the “backwards law” we talked about earlier, in that they’re “negative.” All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. These five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable. But, to me, they are life-changing. The first, which we’ll look at in the next chapter, is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.     CHAPTER 5 You Are Always Choosing Imagine that somebody puts a gun to your head and tells you that you have to run 26.2 miles in under five hours, or else he’ll kill you and your entire family. That would suck. Now imagine that you bought nice shoes and running gear, trained religiously for months, and completed your first marathon with all of your closest family and friends cheering you on at the finish line. That could potentially be one of the proudest moments of your life. Exact same 26.2 miles. Exact same person running them. Exact same pain coursing through your exact same legs. But when you chose it freely and prepared for it, it was a glorious and important milestone in your life. When it was forced upon you against your will, it was one of the most terrifying and painful experiences of your life. Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it. If you’re miserable in your current situation, chances are it’s because you feel like some part of it is outside your control—that there’s a problem you have no ability to solve, a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing. When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable. The Choice William James had problems. Really bad problems. Although born into a wealthy and prominent family, from birth James suffered life-threatening health issues: an eye problem that left him temporarily blinded as a child; a terrible stomach condition that caused excessive vomiting and forced him to adopt an obscure and highly sensitive diet; trouble with his hearing; back spasms so bad that for days at a time he often couldn’t sit or stand upright. Due to his health problems, James spent most of his time at home. He didn’t have many friends, and he wasn’t particularly good at school. Instead, he passed the days painting. That was the only thing he liked and the only thing he felt particularly good at. Unfortunately, nobody else thought he was good at it. When he grew to adulthood, nobody bought his work. And as the years dragged on, his father (a wealthy businessman) began ridiculing him for his laziness and his lack of talent. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Henry James, went on to become a world-renowned novelist; his sister, Alice James, made a good living as a writer as well. William was the family oddball, the black sheep. In a desperate attempt to salvage the young man’s future, James’s father used his business connections to get him admitted into Harvard Medical School. It was his last chance, his father told him. If he screwed this up, there was no hope for him. But James never felt at home or at peace at Harvard. Medicine never appealed to him. He spent the whole time feeling like a fake and a fraud. After all, if he couldn’t overcome his own problems, how could he ever hope to have the energy to help others with theirs? After touring a psychiatric facility one day, James mused in his diary that he felt he had more in common with the patients than with the doctors. A few years went by and, again to his father’s disapproval, James dropped out of medical school. But rather than deal with the brunt of his father’s wrath, he decided to get away: he signed up to join an anthropological expedition to the Amazon rain forest. This was in the 1860s, so transcontinental travel was difficult and dangerous. If you ever played the computer game Oregon Trail when you were a kid, it was kind of like that, with the dysentery and drowning oxen and everything. Anyway, James made it all the way to the Amazon, where the real adventure was to begin. Surprisingly, his fragile health held up that whole way. But once he finally made it, on the first day of the expedition, he promptly contracted smallpox and nearly died in the jungle. Then his back spasms returned, painful to the point of making James unable to walk. By this time, he was emaciated and starved from the smallpox, immobilized by his bad back, and left alone in the middle of South America (the rest of the expedition having gone on without him) with no clear way to get home—a journey that would take months and likely kill him anyway. But somehow he eventually made it back to New England, where he was greeted by an (even more) disappointed father. By this point the young man wasn’t so young anymore—nearly thirty years old, still unemployed, a failure at everything he had attempted, with a body that routinely betrayed him and wasn’t likely to ever get better. Despite all the advantages and opportunities he’d been given in life, everything had fallen apart. The only constants in his life seemed to be suffering and disappointment. James fell into a deep depression and began making plans to take his own life. But one night, while reading lectures by the philosopher Charles Peirce, James decided to conduct a little experiment. In his diary, he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure. If nothing improved in that year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and then he would take his own life. The punch line? William James went on to become the father of American psychology. His work has been translated into a bazillion languages, and he’s regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals/philosophers/psychologists of his generation. He would go on to teach at Harvard and would tour much of the United States and Europe giving lectures. He would marry and have five children (one of whom, Henry, would become a famous biographer and win a Pulitzer Prize). James would later refer to his little experiment as his “rebirth,” and would credit it with everything that he later accomplished in his life. There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences. It’s impossible not to be. Choosing to not consciously interpret events in our lives is still an interpretation of the events of our lives. Choosing to not respond to the events in our lives is still a response to the events in our lives. Even if you get run over by a clown car and pissed on by a busload of schoolchildren, it’s still your responsibility to interpret the meaning of the event and choose a response. Whether we like it or not, we are always taking an active role in what’s occurring to and within us. We are always interpreting the meaning of every moment and every occurrence. We are always choosing the values by which we live and the metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us. Often the same event can be good or bad, depending on the metric we choose to use. The point is, we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always. It comes back to how, in reality, there is no such thing as not giving a single fuck. It’s impossible. We must all give a fuck about something. To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something. The real question is, What are we choosing to give a fuck about? What values are we choosing to base our actions on? What metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life? And are those good choices—good values and good metrics? The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy Years ago, when I was much younger and stupider, I wrote a blog post, and at the end of it I said something like, “And as a great philosopher once said: ‘With great power comes great responsibility.’” It sounded nice and authoritative. I couldn’t remember who had said it, and my Google search had turned up nothing, but I stuck it in there anyway. It fit the post nicely. About ten minutes later, the first comment came in: “I think the ‘great philosopher’ you’re referring to is Uncle Ben from the movie Spider-Man.” As another great philosopher once said, “Doh!” “With great power comes great responsibility.” The last words of Uncle Ben before a thief whom Peter Parker let get away murders him on a sidewalk full of people for absolutely no explicable reason. That great philosopher. Still, we’ve all heard the quote. It gets repeated a lot—usually ironically and after about seven beers. It’s one of those perfect quotes that sound really intelligent, and yet it’s basically just telling you what you already know, even if you’ve never quite thought about the matter before. “With great power comes great responsibility.” It is true. But there’s a better version of this quote, a version that actually is profound, and all you have to do is switch the nouns around: “With great responsibility comes great power.” The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives. Accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them. I once knew a man who was convinced that the reason no woman would date him was because he was too short. He was educated, interesting, and good-looking—a good catch, in principle—but he was absolutely convinced that women found him too short to date. And because he felt that he was too short, he didn’t often go out and try to meet women. The few times he did, he would home in on the smallest behaviors from any woman he talked with that could possibly indicate he wasn’t attractive enough for her and then convince himself that she didn’t like him, even if she really did. As you can imagine, his dating life sucked. What he didn’t realize was that he had chosen the value that was hurting him: height. Women, he assumed, are attracted only to height. He was screwed, no matter what he did. This choice of value was disempowering. It gave this man a really crappy problem: not being tall enough in a world meant (in his view) for tall people. There are far better values that he could have adopted in his dating life. “I want to date only women who like me for who I am” might have been a nice place to start—a metric that assesses the values of honesty and acceptance. But he did not choose these values. He likely wasn’t even aware that he was choosing his value (or could do so). Even though he didn’t realize it, he was responsible for his own problems. Despite that responsibility, he went on complaining: “But I don’t have a choice,” he would tell the bartender. “There’s nothing I can do! Women are superficial and vain and will never like me!” Yes, it’s every single woman’s fault for not liking a self-pitying, shallow guy with shitty values. Obviously. A lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems. Responsibility and fault often appear together in our culture. But they’re not the same thing. If I hit you with my car, I am both at fault and likely legally responsible to compensate you in some way. Even if hitting you with my car was an accident, I am still responsible. This is the way fault works in our society: if you fuck up, you’re on the hook for making it right. And it should be that way. But there are also problems that we aren’t at fault for, yet we are still responsible for them. For example, if you woke up one day and there was a newborn baby on your doorstep, it would not be your fault that the baby had been put there, but the baby would now be your responsibility. You would have to choose what to do. And whatever you ended up choosing (keeping it, getting rid of it, ignoring it, feeding it to a pit bull), there would be problems associated with your choice—and you would be responsible for those as well. Judges don’t get to choose their cases. When a case goes to court, the judge assigned to it did not commit the crime, was not a witness to the crime, and was not affected by the crime, but he or she is still responsible for the crime. The judge must then choose the consequences; he or she must identify the metric against which the crime will be measured and make sure that the chosen metric is carried out. We are responsible for experiences that aren’t our fault all the time. This is part of life. Here’s one way to think about the distinction between the two concepts. Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you’re currently making, every second of every day. You are choosing to read this. You are choosing to think about the concepts. You are choosing to accept or reject the concepts. It may be my fault that you think my ideas are lame, but you are responsible for coming to your own conclusions. It’s not your fault that I chose to write this sentence, but you are still responsible for choosing to read it (or not). There’s a difference between blaming someone else for your situation and that person’s actually being responsible for your situation. Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. You always get to choose the metric by which to measure your experiences. My first girlfriend dumped me in spectacular fashion. She was cheating on me with her teacher. It was awesome. And by awesome, I mean it felt like getting punched in the stomach about 253 times. To make things worse, when I confronted her about it, she promptly left me for him. Three years together, down the toilet just like that. I was miserable for months afterward. That was to be expected. But I also held her responsible for my misery. Which, take it from me, didn’t get me very far. It just made the misery worse. See, I couldn’t control her. No matter how many times I called her, or screamed at her, or begged her to take me back, or made surprise visits to her place, or did other creepy and irrational ex-boyfriend things, I could never control her emotions or her actions. Ultimately, while she was to blame for how I felt, she was never responsible for how I felt. I was. At some point, after enough tears and alcohol, my thinking began to shift and I began to understand that although she had done something horrible to me and she could be blamed for that, it was now my own responsibility to make myself happy again. She was never going to pop up and fix things for me. I had to fix them for myself. When I took that approach, a few things happened. First, I began to improve myself. I started exercising and spending more time with my friends (whom I had been neglecting). I started deliberately meeting new people. I took a big study-abroad trip and did some volunteer work. And slowly, I started to feel better. I still resented my ex for what she had done. But at least now I was taking responsibility for my own emotions. And by doing so, I was choosing better values—values aimed at taking care of myself, learning to feel better about myself, rather than aimed at getting her to fix what she’d broken. (By the way, this whole “holding her responsible for my emotions” thing is probably part of why she left in the first place. More on that in a couple chapters.) Then, about a year later, something funny began to happen. As I looked back on our relationship, I started to notice problems I had never noticed before, problems that I was to blame for and that I could have done something to solve. I realized that it was likely that I hadn’t been a great boyfriend, and that people don’t just magically cheat on somebody they’ve been with unless they are unhappy for some reason. I’m not saying that this excused what my ex did—not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn’t been the innocent victim I’d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it. In hindsight, I was able to look back and see warning signs of my ex-girlfriend’s character, signs I had chosen to ignore or brush off when I was with her. That was my fault. I could look back and see that I hadn’t exactly been the Boyfriend of the Year to her either. In fact, I had often been cold and arrogant toward her; other times I took her for granted and blew her off and hurt her. These things were my fault too. Did my mistakes justify her mistake? No. But still, I took on the responsibility of never making those same mistakes again, and never overlooking the same signs again, to help guarantee that I will never suffer the same consequences again. I took on the responsibility of striving to make my future relationships with women that much better. And I’m happy to report that I have. No more cheating girlfriends leaving me, no more 253 stomach punches. I took responsibility for my problems and improved upon them. I took responsibility for my role in that unhealthy relationship and improved upon it with later relationships. And you know what? My ex leaving me, while one of the most painful experiences I’ve ever had, was also one of the most important and influential experiences of my life. I credit it with inspiring a significant amount of personal growth. I learned more from that single problem than dozens of my successes combined. We all love to take responsibility for success and happiness. Hell, we often fight over who gets to be responsible for success and happiness. But taking responsibility for our problems is far more important, because that’s where the real learning comes from. That’s where the real-life improvement comes from. To simply blame others is only to hurt yourself. Responding to Tragedy But what about really awful events? A lot of people can get on board with taking responsibility for work-related problems and maybe watching too much TV when they should really be playing with their kids or being productive. But when it comes to horrible tragedies, they pull the emergency cord on the responsibility train and get off when it stops. Some things just feel too painful for them to own up to. But think about it: the intensity of the event doesn’t change the underlying truth. If you get robbed, say, you’re obviously not at fault for being robbed. No one would ever choose to go through that. But as with the baby on your doorstep, you are immediately thrust into responsibility for a life-and-death situation. Do you fight back? Do you panic? Do you freeze up? Do you tell the police? Do you try to forget it and pretend it never happened? These are all choices and reactions you’re responsible for making or rejecting. You didn’t choose the robbery, but it’s still your responsibility to manage the emotional and psychological (and legal) fallout of the experience. In 2008, the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley, a remote part of northeastern Pakistan. They quickly implemented their Muslim extremist agenda. No television. No films. No women outside the house without a male escort. No girls attending school. By 2009, an eleven-year-old Pakistani girl named Malala Yousafzai had begun to speak out against the school ban. She continued to attend her local school, risking both her and her father’s lives; she also attended conferences in nearby cities. She wrote online, “How dare the Taliban take away my right for education?” In 2012, at the age of fourteen, she was shot in the face as she rode the bus home from school one day. A masked Taliban soldier armed with a rifle boarded the bus and asked, “Who is Malala? Tell me, or I will shoot everyone here.” Malala identified herself (an amazing choice in and of itself), and the man shot her in the head in front of all the other passengers. Malala went into a coma and almost died. The Taliban stated publicly that if she somehow survived the attempt, they would kill both her and her father. Today, Malala is still alive. She still speaks out against violence and oppression toward women in Muslim countries, now as a best-selling author. In 2014 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts. It would seem that being shot in the face only gave her a larger audience and more courage than before. It would have been easy for her to lie down and say, “I can’t do anything,” or “I have no choice.” That, ironically, would still have been her choice. But she chose the opposite. A few years ago, I had written about some of the ideas in this chapter on my blog, and a man left a comment. He said that I was shallow and superficial, adding that I had no real understanding of life’s problems or human responsibility. He said that his son had recently died in a car accident. He accused me of not knowing what true pain was and said that I was an asshole for suggesting that he himself was responsible for the pain he felt over his son’s death. This man had obviously suffered pain much greater than most people ever have to confront in their lives. He didn’t choose for his son to die, nor was it his fault that his son died. The responsibility for coping with that loss was given to him even though it was clearly and understandably unwanted. But despite all that, he was still responsible for his own emotions, beliefs, and actions. How he reacted to his son’s death was his own choice. Pain of one sort or another is inevitable for all of us, but we get to choose what it means to and for us. Even in claiming that he had no choice in the matter and simply wanted his son back, he was making a choice—one of many ways he could have chosen to use that pain. Of course, I didn’t say any of this to him. I was too busy being horrified and thinking that yes, perhaps I was way in over my head and had no idea what the fuck I was talking about. That’s a hazard that comes with my line of work. A problem that I chose. And a problem that I was responsible for dealing with. At first, I felt awful. But then, after a few minutes, I began to get angry. His objections had little to do with what I was actually saying, I told myself. And what the hell? Just because I don’t have a kid who died doesn’t mean I haven’t experienced terrible pain myself. But then I actually applied my own advice. I chose my problem. I could get mad at this man and argue with him, try to “outpain” him with my own pain, which would just make us both look stupid and insensitive. Or I could choose a better problem, working on practicing patience, understanding my readers better, and keeping that man in mind every time I wrote about pain and trauma from then on. And that’s what I’ve tried to do. I replied simply that I was sorry for his loss and left it at that. What else can you say? Genetics and the Hand We’re Dealt In 2013, the BBC rounded up half a dozen teenagers with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and followed them as they attended intensive therapies to help them overcome their unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors. There was Imogen, a seventeen-year-old girl who had a compulsive need to tap every surface she walked past; if she failed to do so, she was flooded with horrible thoughts of her family dying. There was Josh, who needed to do everything with both sides of his body—shake a person’s hand with both his right and his left hand, eat his food with each hand, step through a doorway with both feet, and so on. If he didn’t “equalize” his two sides, he suffered from severe panic attacks. And then there was Jack, a classic germophobe who refused to leave his house without wearing gloves, boiled all his water before drinking it, and refused to eat food not cleaned and prepared himself. OCD is a terrible neurological and genetic disorder that cannot be cured. At best, it can be managed. And, as we’ll see, managing the disorder comes down to managing one’s values. The first thing the psychiatrists on this project do is tell the kids that they’re to accept the imperfections of their compulsive desires. What that means, as one example, is that when Imogen becomes flooded with horrible thoughts of her family dying, she is to accept that her family may actually die and that there’s nothing she can do about it; simply put, she is told that what happens to her is not her fault. Josh is forced to accept that over the long term, “equalizing” all of his behaviors to make them symmetrical is actually destroying his life more than occasional panic attacks would. And Jack is reminded that no matter what he does, germs are always present and always infecting him. The goal is to get the kids to recognize that their values are not rational—that in fact their values are not even theirs, but rather are the disorder’s—and that by fulfilling these irrational values they are actually harming their ability to function in life. The next step is to encourage the kids to choose a value that is more important than their OCD value and to focus on that. For Josh, it’s the possibility of not having to hide his disorder from his friends and family all the time, the prospect of having a normal, functioning social life. For Imogen, it’s the idea of taking control over her own thoughts and feelings and being happy again. And for Jack, it’s the ability to leave his house for long periods of time without suffering traumatic episodes. With these new values held front and center in their minds, the teenagers set out on intensive desensitization exercises that force them to live out their new values. Panic attacks ensue; tears are shed; Jack punches an array of inanimate objects and then immediately washes his hands. But by the end of the documentary, major progress has been made. Imogen no longer needs to tap every surface she comes across. She says, “There are still monsters in the back of my mind, and there probably always will be, but they’re getting quieter now.” Josh is able to go periods of twenty-five to thirty minutes without “equalizing” his behaviors between both sides of his body. And Jack, who makes perhaps the most improvement, is actually able to go out to restaurants and drink out of bottles and glasses without washing them first. Jack sums up well what he learned: “I didn’t choose this life; I didn’t choose this horrible, horrible condition. But I get to choose how to live with it; I have to choose how to live with it.” A lot of people treat being born with a disadvantage, whether OCD or small stature or something very different, as though they were screwed out of something highly valuable. They feel that there’s nothing they can do about it, so they avoid responsibility for their situation. They figure, “I didn’t choose my crappy genetics, so it’s not my fault if things go wrong.” And it’s true, it’s not their fault. But it’s still their responsibility. Back in college, I had a bit of a delusional fantasy of becoming a professional poker player. I won money and everything, and it was fun, but after almost a year of serious play, I quit. The lifestyle of staying up all night staring at a computer screen, winning thousands of dollars one day and then losing most of it the next, wasn’t for me, and it wasn’t exactly the most healthy or emotionally stable means of earning a living. But my time playing poker had a surprisingly profound influence on the way I see life. The beauty of poker is that while luck is always involved, luck doesn’t dictate the long-term results of the game. A person can get dealt terrible cards and beat someone who was dealt great cards. Sure, the person who gets dealt great cards has a higher likelihood of winning the hand, but ultimately the winner is determined by—yup, you guessed it—the choices each player makes throughout play. I see life in the same terms. We all get dealt cards. Some of us get better cards than others. And while it’s easy to get hung up on our cards, and feel we got screwed over, the real game lies in the choices we make with those cards, the risks we decide to take, and the consequences we choose to live with. People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they’re given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker, just as in life. And it’s not necessarily the people with the best cards. There are those who suffer psychologically and emotionally from neurological and/or genetic deficiencies. But this changes nothing. Sure, they inherited a bad hand and are not to blame. No more than the short guy wanting to get a date is to blame for being short. Or the person who got robbed is to blame for being robbed. But it’s still their responsibility. Whether they choose to seek psychiatric treatment, undergo therapy, or do nothing, the choice is ultimately theirs to make. There are those who suffer through bad childhoods. There are those who are abused and violated and screwed over, physically, emotionally, financially. They are not to blame for their problems and their hindrances, but they are still responsible—always responsible—to move on despite their problems and to make the best choices they can, given their circumstances. And let’s be honest here. If you were to add up all of the people who have some psychiatric disorder, struggle with depression or suicidal thoughts, have been subjected to neglect or abuse, have dealt with tragedy or the death of a loved one, and have survived serious health issues, accidents, or trauma—if you were to round up all of those people and put them in the room, well, you’d probably have to round up everyone, because nobody makes it through life without collecting a few scars on the way out. Sure, some people get saddled with worse problems than others. And some people are legitimately victimized in horrible ways. But as much as this may upset us or disturb us, it ultimately changes nothing about the responsibility equation of our individual situation. Victimhood Chic The responsibility/fault fallacy allows people to pass off the responsibility for solving their problems to others. This ability to alleviate responsibility through blame gives people a temporary high and a feeling of moral righteousness. Unfortunately, one side effect of the Internet and social media is that it’s become easier than ever to push responsibility—for even the tiniest of infractions—onto some other group or person. In fact, this kind of public blame/shame game has become popular; in certain crowds it’s even seen as “cool.” The public sharing of “injustices” garners far more attention and emotional outpouring than most other events on social media, rewarding people who are able to perpetually feel victimized with ever-growing amounts of attention and sympathy. “Victimhood chic” is in style on both the right and the left today, among both the rich and the poor. In fact, this may be the first time in human history that every single demographic group has felt unfairly victimized simultaneously. And they’re all riding the highs of the moral indignation that comes along with it. Right now, anyone who is offended about anything—whether it’s the fact that a book about racism was assigned in a university class, or that Christmas trees were banned at the local mall, or the fact that taxes were raised half a percent on investment funds—feels as though they’re being oppressed in some way and therefore deserve to be outraged and to have a certain amount of attention. The current media environment both encourages and perpetuates these reactions because, after all, it’s good for business. The writer and media commentator Ryan Holiday refers to this as “outrage porn”: rather than report on real stories and real issues, the media find it much easier (and more profitable) to find something mildly offensive, broadcast it to a wide audience, generate outrage, and then broadcast that outrage back across the population in a way that outrages yet another part of the population. This triggers a kind of echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two imaginary sides, meanwhile distracting everyone from real societal problems. It’s no wonder we’re more politically polarized than ever before. The biggest problem with victimhood chic is that it sucks attention away from actual victims. It’s like the boy who cried wolf. The more people there are who proclaim themselves victims over tiny infractions, the harder it becomes to see who the real victims actually are. People get addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high; being self-righteous and morally superior feels good. As political cartoonist Tim Kreider put it in a New York Times op-ed: “Outrage is like a lot of other things that feel good but over time devour us from the inside out. And it’s even more insidious than most vices because we don’t even consciously acknowledge that it’s a pleasure.” But part of living in a democracy and a free society is that we all have to deal with views and people we don’t necessarily like. That’s simply the price we pay—you could even say it’s the whole point of the system. And it seems more and more people are forgetting that. We should pick our battles carefully, while simultaneously attempting to empathize a bit with the so-called enemy. We should approach the news and media with a healthy dose of skepticism and avoid painting those who disagree with us with a broad brush. We should prioritize values of being honest, fostering transparency, and welcoming doubt over the values of being right, feeling good, and getting revenge. These “democratic” values are harder to maintain amidst the constant noise of a networked world. But we must accept the responsibility and nurture them regardless. The future stability of our political systems may depend on it. There Is No “How” A lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, “Okay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I’m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience—but how do I change?” And to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: “Do, or do not; there is no ‘how.’ ” You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. It really is that simple. It’s just not easy. It’s not easy because you’re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You’re going to be nervous. You’re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you’re giving. But they are inevitable. It’s simple but really, really hard. Let’s look at some of these side effects. You’re going to feel uncertain; I guarantee it. “Should I really give this up? Is this the right thing to do?” Giving up a value you’ve depended on for years is going to feel disorienting, as if you don’t really know right from wrong anymore. This is hard, but it’s normal. Next, you’ll feel like a failure. You’ve spent half your life measuring yourself by that old value, so when you change your priorities, change your metrics, and stop behaving in the same way, you’ll fail to meet that old, trusted metric and thus immediately feel like some sort of fraud or nobody. This is also normal and also uncomfortable. And certainly you will weather rejections. Many of the relationships in your life were built around the values you’ve been keeping, so the moment you change those values—the moment you decide that studying is more important than partying, that getting married and having a family is more important than rampant sex, that working a job you believe in is more important than money—your turnaround will reverberate out through your relationships, and many of them will blow up in your face. This too is normal and this too will be uncomfortable. These are necessary, though painful, side effects of choosing to place your fucks elsewhere, in a place far more important and more worthy of your energies. As you reassess your values, you will be met with internal and external resistance along the way. More than anything, you will feel uncertain; you will wonder if what you’re doing is wrong. But as we’ll see, this is a good thing.     CHAPTER 6 You’re Wrong About Everything (But So Am I) Five hundred years ago cartographers believed that California was an island. Doctors believed that slicing a person’s arm open (or causing bleeding anywhere) could cure disease. Scientists believed that fire was made out of something called phlogiston. Women believed that rubbing dog urine on their face had anti-aging benefits. Astronomers believed that the sun revolved around the earth. When I was a little boy, I used to think “mediocre” was a kind of vegetable that I didn’t want to eat. I thought my brother had found a secret passageway in my grandmother’s house because he could get outside without having to leave the bathroom (spoiler alert: there was a window). I also thought that when my friend and his family visited “Washington, B.C.,” they had somehow traveled back in time to when the dinosaurs lived, because after all, “B.C.” was a long time ago. As a teenager, I told everybody that I didn’t care about anything, when the truth was I cared about way too much. Other people ruled my world without my even knowing. I thought happiness was a destiny and not a choice. I thought love was something that just happened, not something that you worked for. I thought being “cool” had to be practiced and learned from others, rather than invented for oneself. When I was with my first girlfriend, I thought we would be together forever. And then, when that relationship ended, I thought I’d never feel the same way about a woman again. And then when I felt the same way about a woman again, I thought that love sometimes just wasn’t enough. And then I realized that each individual gets to decide what is “enough,” and that love can be whatever we let it be. Every step of the way I was wrong. About everything. Throughout my life, I’ve been flat-out wrong about myself, others, society, culture, the world, the universe—everything. And I hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life. Just as Present Mark can look back on Past Mark’s every flaw and mistake, one day Future Mark will look back on Present Mark’s assumptions (including the contents of this book) and notice similar flaws. And that will be a good thing. Because that will mean I have grown. There’s a famous Michael Jordan quote about him failing over and over and over again, and that’s why he succeeded. Well, I’m always wrong about everything, over and over and over again, and that’s why my life improves. Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection. We shouldn’t seek to find the ultimate “right” answer for ourselves, but rather, we should seek to chip away at the ways that we’re wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow. When viewed from this perspective, personal growth can actually be quite scientific. Our values are our hypotheses: this behavior is good and important; that other behavior is not. Our actions are the experiments; the resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data. There is no correct dogma or perfect ideology. There is only what your experience has shown you to be right for you—and even then, that experience is probably somewhat wrong too. And because you and I and everybody else all have differing needs and personal histories and life circumstances, we will all inevitably come to differing “correct” answers about what our lives mean and how they should be lived. My correct answer involves traveling alone for years on end, living in obscure places, and laughing at my own farts. Or at least that was the correct answer up until recently. That answer will change and evolve, because I change and evolve; and as I grow older and more experienced, I chip away at how wrong I am, becoming less and less wrong every day. Many people become so obsessed with being “right” about their life that they never end up actually living it. A certain woman is single and lonely and wants a partner, but she never gets out of the house and does anything about it. A certain man works his ass off and believes he deserves a promotion, but he never explicitly says that to his boss. They’re told that they’re afraid of failure, of rejection, of someone saying no. But that’s not it. Sure, rejection hurts. Failure sucks. But there are particular certainties that we hold on to—certainties that we’re afraid to question or let go of, values that have given our lives meaning over the years. That woman doesn’t get out there and date because she would be forced to confront her beliefs about her own desirability. That man doesn’t ask for the promotion because he would have to confront his beliefs about what his skills are actually worth. It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure. Beliefs of this sort—that I’m not attractive enough, so why bother; or that my boss is an asshole, so why bother—are designed to give us moderate comfort now by mortgaging greater happiness and success later on. They’re terrible long-term strategies, yet we cling to them because we assume we’re right, because we assume we already know what’s supposed to happen. In other words, we assume we know how the story ends. Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened—and even then, it’s still debatable. That’s why accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place. Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are. Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth. It means not cutting your arm open to cure a cold or splashing dog piss on your face to look young again. It means not thinking “mediocre” is a vegetable, and not being afraid to care about things. Because here’s something that’s weird but true: we don’t actually know what a positive or negative experience is. Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating. Don’t trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesn’t. And that’s not worth much. Just as we look back in horror at the lives of people five hundred years ago, I imagine people five hundred years from now will laugh at us and our certainties today. They will laugh at how we let our money and our jobs define our lives. They will laugh at how we were afraid to show appreciation for those who matter to us most, yet heaped praise on public figures who didn’t deserve anything. They will laugh at our rituals and superstitions, our worries and our wars; they will gawk at our cruelty. They will study our art and argue over our history. They will understand truths about us of which none of us are yet aware. And they, too, will be wrong. Just less wrong than we were. Architects of Our Own Beliefs Try this. Take a random person and put them in a room with some buttons to push. Then tell them that if they do something specific—some undefined something that they have to figure out—a light will flash on indicating that they’ve won a point. Then tell them to see how many points they can earn within a thirty-minute period. When psychologists have done this, what happens is what you might expect. People sit down and start mashing buttons at random until eventually the light comes on to tell them they got a point. Logically, they then try repeating whatever they were doing to get more points. Except now the light’s not coming on. So they start experimenting with more complicated sequences—press this button three times, then this button once, then wait five seconds, and—ding! Another point. But eventually that stops working. Perhaps it doesn’t have to do with buttons at all, they think. Perhaps it has to do with how I’m sitting. Or what I’m touching. Maybe it has to do with my feet. Ding! Another point. Yeah, maybe it’s my feet and then I press another button. Ding! Generally, within ten to fifteen minutes each person has figured out the specific sequence of behaviors required to net more points. It’s usually something weird like standing on one foot or memorizing a long sequence of buttons pressed in a specific amount of time while facing a certain direction. But here’s the funny part: the points really are random. There’s no sequence; there’s no pattern. Just a light that keeps coming on with a ding, and people doing cartwheels thinking that what they’re doing is giving them points. Sadism aside, the point of the experiment is to show how quickly the human mind is capable of coming up with and believing in a bunch of bullshit that isn’t real. And it turns out, we’re all really good at it. Every person leaves that room convinced that he or she nailed the experiment and won the game. They all believe that they discovered the “perfect” sequence of buttons that earned them their points. But the methods they come up with are as unique as the individuals themselves. One man came up with a long sequence of button-pushing that made no sense to anyone but himself. One girl came to believe that she had to tap the ceiling a certain number of times to get points. When she left the room she was exhausted from jumping up and down. Our brains are meaning machines. What we understand as “meaning” is generated by the associations our brain makes between two or more experiences. We press a button, then we see a light go on; we assume the button caused the light to go on. This, at its core, is the basis of meaning. Button, light; light, button. We see a chair. We note that it’s gray. Our brain then draws the association between the color (gray) and the object (chair) and forms meaning: “The chair is gray.” Our minds are constantly whirring, generating more and more associations to help us understand and control the environment around us. Everything about our experiences, both external and internal, generates new associations and connections within our minds. Everything from the words on this page, to the grammatical concepts you use to decipher them, to the dirty thoughts your mind wanders into when my writing becomes boring or repetitive—each of these thoughts, impulses, and perceptions is composed of thousands upon thousands of neural connections, firing in conjunction, alighting your mind in a blaze of knowledge and understanding. But there are two problems. First, the brain is imperfect. We mistake things we see and hear. We forget things or misinterpret events quite easily. Second, once we create meaning for ourselves, our brains are designed to hold on to that meaning. We are biased toward the meaning our mind has made, and we don’t want to let go of it. Even if we see evidence that contradicts the meaning we created, we often ignore it and keep on believing anyway. The comedian Emo Philips once said, “I used to think the human brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I realized who was telling me this.” The unfortunate fact is, most of what we come to “know” and believe is the product of the innate inaccuracies and biases present in our brains. Many or even most of our values are products of events that are not representative of the world at large, or are the result of a totally misconceived past. The result of all this? Most of our beliefs are wrong. Or, to be more exact, all beliefs are wrong—some are just less wrong than others. The human mind is a jumble of inaccuracy. And while this may make you uncomfortable, it’s an incredibly important concept to accept, as we’ll see. Be Careful What You Believe In 1988, while in therapy, the journalist and feminist author Meredith Maran came to a startling realization: her father had sexually abused her as a child. It was a shock to her, a repressed memory she had spent most of her adult life oblivious to. But at the age of thirty-seven, she confronted her father and also told her family what had happened. Meredith’s news horrified her entire family. Her father immediately denied having done anything. Some family members sided with Meredith. Others sided with her father. The family tree was split in two. And the pain that had defined Meredith’s relationship with her father since long before her accusation now spread like a mold across its branches. It tore everyone apart. Then, in 1996, Meredith came to another startling realization: her father actually hadn’t sexually abused her. (I know: oops.) She, with the help of a well-intentioned therapist, had actually invented the memory. Consumed by guilt, she spent the rest of her father’s life attempting to reconcile with him and other family members through constant apologizing and explaining. But it was too late. Her father passed away and her family would never be the same. It turned out Meredith wasn’t alone. As she describes in her autobiography, My Lie: A True Story of False Memory, throughout the 1980s, many women accused male family members of sexual abuse only to turn around and recant years later. Similarly, there was a whole swath of people who claimed during that same decade that there were satanic cults abusing children, yet despite police investigations in dozens of cities, police never found any evidence of the crazy practices described. Why were people suddenly inventing memories of horrible abuse in families and cults? And why was it all happening then, in the 1980s? Ever play the telephone game as a kid? You know, you say something in one person’s ear and it gets passed through like ten people, and what the last person hears is completely unrelated to what you started with? That’s basically how our memories work. We experience something. Then we remember it slightly differently a few days later, as if it had been whispered and misheard. Then we tell somebody about it and have to fill in a couple of the plot holes with our own embellishments to make sure everything makes sense and we’re not crazy. And then we come to believe those little filled-in mental gaps, and so we tell those the next time too. Except they’re not real, so we get them a little bit wrong. And we’re drunk one night a year later when we tell the story, so we embellish it a little bit more—okay, let’s be honest, we completely make up about one-third of it. But when we’re sober the next week, we don’t want to admit that we’re a big fat liar, so we go along with the revised and newly expanded drunkard version of our story. And five years later, our absolutely, swear-to-god, swear-on-my-mother’s-grave, truer-than-true story is at most 50 percent true. We all do this. You do. I do. No matter how honest and well-intentioned we are, we’re in a perpetual state of misleading ourselves and others for no other reason than that our brain is designed to be efficient, not accurate. Not only does our memory suck—suck to the point that eyewitness testimony isn’t necessarily taken seriously in court cases—but our brain functions in a horribly biased way. How so? Well, our brain is always trying to make sense of our current situation based on what we already believe and have already experienced. Every new piece of information is measured against the values and conclusions we already have. As a result, our brain is always biased toward what we feel to be true in that moment. So when we have a great relationship with our sister, we’ll interpret most of our memories about her in a positive light. But when the relationship sours, we’ll often come to see those exact same memories differently, reinventing them in such a way as to explain our present-day anger toward her. That sweet gift she gave us last Christmas is now remembered as patronizing and condescending. That time she forgot to invite us to her lake house is now seen not as an innocent mistake but as horrible negligence. Meredith’s fake abuse story makes far more sense when we understand the values in which her beliefs arose. First of all, Meredith had had a strained and difficult relationship with her father throughout most of her life. Second, Meredith had had a series of failed intimate relationships with men, including a failed marriage. So already, in terms of her values, “close relationships with men” weren’t doing so hot. Then, in the early 1980s, Meredith became a radical feminist and began doing research into child abuse. She was confronted with horrific story after horrific story of abuse, and she dealt with incest survivors—usually little girls—for years on end. She also reported extensively on a number of inaccurate studies that came out around that time—studies that it later turned out grossly overestimated the prevalence of child molestation. (The most famous study reported that a third of adult women had been sexually molested as children, a number that has since been shown to be false.) And on top of all of this, Meredith fell in love and began a relationship with another woman, an incest survivor. Meredith developed a codependent and toxic relationship with her partner, one in which Meredith continually tried to “save” the other woman from her traumatic past. Her partner also used her traumatic past as a weapon of guilt to earn Meredith’s affection (more on this and boundaries in chapter 8). Meanwhile, Meredith’s relationship with her father deteriorated even further (he wasn’t exactly thrilled that she was now in a lesbian relationship), and she was attending therapy at an almost compulsive rate. Her therapists, who had their own values and beliefs driving their behavior, regularly insisted that it couldn’t simply be Meredith’s highly stressful reporting job or her poor relationships that were making her so unhappy; it must be something else, something deeper. Around this time, a new form of treatment called repressed memory therapy was becoming hugely popular. This therapy involved a therapist putting a client into a trancelike state where she was encouraged to root out and reexperience forgotten childhood memories. These memories were often benign, but the idea was that at least a few of them would be traumatic as well. So there you have poor Meredith, miserable and researching incest and child molestation every day, angry at her father, having endured an entire lifetime of failed relationships with men, and the only person who seems to understand her or love her is another woman who is a survivor of incest. Oh, and she’s lying on a couch crying every other day with a therapist demanding over and over that she remember something she can’t remember. And voilà, you have a perfect recipe for an invented memory of sexual abuse that never happened. Our mind’s biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they will cohere with all of our previous experiences, feelings, and beliefs. But often we run into life situations where past and present don’t cohere: on such occasions, what we’re experiencing in the moment flies in the face of everything we’ve accepted as true and reasonable about our past. In an effort to achieve coherence, our mind will sometimes, in cases like that, invent false memories. By linking our present experiences with that imagined past, our mind allows us to maintain whatever meaning we already established. As noted earlier, Meredith’s story is not unique. In fact, in the 1980s and early 1990s, hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it. For people who were dissatisfied with their lives, these suggestive explanations, combined with the sensationalizing media—there were veritable epidemics of sexual abuse and satanic violence going on, and you could be a victim too—gave people’s unconscious minds the incentive to fudge their memories a bit and explain their current suffering in a way that allowed them to be victims and avoid responsibility. Repressed memory therapy then acted as a means to pull these unconscious desires out and put them into a seemingly tangible form of a memory. This process, and the state of mind it resulted in, became so common that a name was introduced for it: false memory syndrome. It changed the way courtrooms operate. Thousands of therapists were sued and lost their licenses. Repressed memory therapy fell out of practice and was replaced by more practical methods. Recent research has only reinforced the painful lesson of that era: our beliefs are malleable, and our memories are horribly unreliable. There’s a lot of conventional wisdom out there telling you to “trust yourself,” to “go with your gut,” and all sorts of other pleasant-sounding clichés. But perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more. If we’re all wrong, all the time, then isn’t self-skepticism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress? This may sound scary and self-destructive. But it’s actually quite the opposite. It’s not only the safer option, but it’s liberating as well. The Dangers of Pure Certainty Erin sits across from me at the sushi restaurant and tries to explain why she doesn’t believe in death. It’s been almost three hours, and she’s eaten exactly four cucumber rolls and drunk an entire bottle of sake by herself. (In fact, she’s about halfway through bottle number two now.) It’s four o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t invite her here. She found out where I was via the Internet and flew out to come find me. Again. She’s done this before. You see, Erin is convinced that she can cure death, but she’s also convinced that she needs my help to do it. But not my help in like a business sense. If she just needed some PR advice or something, that would be one thing. No, it’s more than that: she needs me to be her boyfriend. Why? After three hours of questioning and a bottle and a half of sake, it still isn’t clear. My fiancée was with us in the restaurant, by the way. Erin thought it important that she be included in the discussion; Erin wanted her to know that she was “willing to share” me and that my girlfriend (now wife) “shouldn’t feel threatened” by her. I met Erin at a self-help seminar in 2008. She seemed like a nice enough person. A little bit on the woo-woo, New Agey side of things, but she was a lawyer and had gone to an Ivy League school, and was clearly smart. And she laughed at my jokes and thought I was cute—so, of course, knowing me, I slept with her. A month later, she invited me to uproot across the country and move in with her. This struck me as somewhat of a red flag, and so I tried to break things off with her. She responded by saying that she would kill herself if I refused to be with her. Okay, so make that two red flags. I promptly blocked her from my email and all my devices. This would slow her down but not stop her. Years before I met her, Erin had gotten into a car accident and nearly died. Actually, she had medically “died” for a few moments—all brain activity had stopped—but she had somehow miraculously been revived. When she “came back,” she claimed everything had changed. She became a very spiritual person. She became interested in, and started believing in, energy healing and angels and universal consciousness and tarot cards. She also believed that she had become a healer and an empath and that she could see the future. And for whatever reason, upon meeting me, she decided that she and I were destined to save the world together. To “cure death,” as she put it. After I’d blocked her, she began to create new email addresses, sometimes sending me as many as a dozen angry emails in a single day. She created fake Facebook and Twitter accounts that she used to harass me as well as people close to me. She created a website identical to mine and wrote dozens of articles claiming that I was her ex-boyfriend and that I had lied to her and cheated her, that I had promised to marry her and that she and I belonged together. When I contacted her to take the site down, she said that she would take it down only if I flew to California to be with her. This was her idea of a compromise. And through all of this, her justification was the same: I was destined to be with her, that God had preordained it, that she literally woke up in the middle of the night to the voices of angels commanding that “our special relationship” was to be the harbinger of a new age of permanent peace on earth. (Yes, she really told me this.) By the time we were sitting in that sushi restaurant together, there had been thousands of emails. Whether I responded or didn’t respond, replied respectfully or replied angrily, nothing ever changed. Her mind never changed; her beliefs never budged. This had gone on for over seven years by then (and counting). And so it was, in that small sushi restaurant, with Erin guzzling sake and babbling for hours about how she’d cured her cat’s kidney stones with energy tapping, that something occurred to me: Erin is a self-improvement junkie. She spends tens of thousands of dollars on books and seminars and courses. And the craziest part of all this is that Erin embodies all the lessons she’s learned to a T. She has her dream. She stays persistent with it. She visualizes and takes action and weathers the rejections and failures and gets up and tries again. She’s relentlessly positive. She thinks pretty damn highly of herself. I mean, she claims to heal cats the same way Jesus healed Lazarus—come the fuck on. And yet her values are so fucked that none of this matters. The fact that she does everything “right” doesn’t make her right. There is a certainty in her that refuses to relinquish itself. She has even told me this in so many words: that she knows her fixation is completely irrational and unhealthy and is making both her and me unhappy. But for some reason it feels so right to her that she can’t ignore it and she can’t stop. In the mid-1990s, psychologist Roy Baumeister began researching the concept of evil. Basically, he looked at people who do bad things and at why they do them. At the time it was assumed that people did bad things because they felt horrible about themselves—that is, they had low self-esteem. One of Baumeister’s first surprising findings was that this was often not true. In fact, it was usually the opposite. Some of the worst criminals felt pretty damn good about themselves. And it was this feeling good about themselves in spite of the reality around them that gave them the sense of justification for hurting and disrespecting others. For individuals to feel justified in doing horrible things to other people, they must feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness, in their own beliefs and deservedness. Racists do racist things because they’re certain about their genetic superiority. Religious fanatics blow themselves up and murder dozens of people because they’re certain of their place in heaven as martyrs. Men rape and abuse women out of their certainty that they’re entitled to women’s bodies. Evil people never believe that they are evil; rather, they believe that everyone else is evil. In controversial experiments, now simply known as the Milgram Experiments, named for the psychologist Stanley Milgram, researchers told “normal” people that they were to punish other volunteers for breaking various rules. And punish them they did, sometimes escalating the punishment to the point of physical abuse. Almost none of the punishers objected or asked for explanation. On the contrary, many of them seemed to relish the certainty of the moral righteousness bestowed upon them by the experiments. The problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable, but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more (and worse) insecurity. Many people have an unshakable certainty in their ability at their job or in the amount of salary they should be making. But that certainty makes them feel worse, not better. They see others getting promoted over them, and they feel slighted. They feel unappreciated and underacknowledged. Even a behavior as simple as sneaking a peek at your boyfriend’s text messages or asking a friend what people are saying about you is driven by insecurity and that aching desire to be certain. You can check your boyfriend’s text messages and find nothing, but that’s rarely the end of it; then you may start wondering if he has a second phone. You can feel slighted and stepped over at work to explain why you missed out on a promotion, but then that causes you to distrust your coworkers and second-guess everything they say to you (and how you think they feel about you), which in turn makes you even less likely to get promoted. You can keep pursuing that special someone you’re “supposed” to be with, but with each rebuffed advance and each lonely night, you only begin to question more and more what you’re doing wrong. And it’s in these moments of insecurity, of deep despair, that we become susceptible to an insidious entitlement: believing that we deserve to cheat a little to get our way, that other people deserve to be punished, that we deserve to take what we want, and sometimes violently. It’s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know. Uncertainty removes our judgments of others; it preempts the unnecessary stereotyping and biases that we otherwise feel when we see somebody on TV, in the office, or on the street. Uncertainty also relieves us of our judgment of ourselves. We don’t know if we’re lovable or not; we don’t know how attractive we are; we don’t know how successful we could potentially become. The only way to achieve these things is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience. Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth. As the old adage goes, the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing. We cannot learn anything without first not knowing something. The more we admit we do not know, the more opportunities we gain to learn. Our values are imperfect and incomplete, and to assume that they are perfect and complete is to put us in a dangerously dogmatic mindset that breeds entitlement and avoids responsibility. The only way to solve our problems is to first admit that our actions and beliefs up to this point have been wrong and are not working. This openness to being wrong must exist for any real change or growth to take place. Before we can look at our values and prioritizations and change them into better, healthier ones, we must first become uncertain of our current values. We must intellectually strip them away, see their faults and biases, see how they don’t fit in with much of the rest of the world, to stare our own ignorance in the face and concede, because our own ignorance is greater than us all. Manson’s Law of Avoidance Chances are you’ve heard some form of Parkinson’s law: “Work expands so as to fill up the time available for its completion.” You’ve also undoubtedly heard of Murphy’s law: “Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.” Well, next time you’re at a swanky cocktail party and you want to impress somebody, try dropping Manson’s law of avoidance on them: The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. That means the more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful/unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values, the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it. There’s a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world. Anything that shakes up that comfort—even if it could potentially make your life better—is inherently scary. Manson’s law applies to both good and bad things in life. Making a million dollars could threaten your identity just as much as losing all your money; becoming a famous rock star could threaten your identity just as much as losing your job. This is why people are often so afraid of success—for the exact same reason they’re afraid of failure: it threatens who they believe themselves to be. You avoid writing that screenplay you’ve always dreamed of because doing so would call into question your identity as a practical insurance adjuster. You avoid talking to your husband about being more adventurous in the bedroom because that conversation would challenge your identity as a good, moral woman. You avoid telling your friend that you don’t want to see him anymore because ending the friendship would conflict with your identity as a nice, forgiving person. These are good, important opportunities that we consistently pass up because they threaten to change how we view and feel about ourselves. They threaten the values that we’ve chosen and have learned to live up to. I had a friend who, for the longest time, talked about putting his artwork online and trying to make a go of it as a professional (or at least semiprofessional) artist. He talked about it for years; he saved up money; he even built a few different websites and uploaded his portfolio. But he never launched. There was always some reason: the resolution on his work wasn’t good enough, or he had just painted something better, or he wasn’t in a position to dedicate enough time to it yet. Years passed and he never did give up his “real job.” Why? Because despite dreaming about making a living through his art, the real potential of becoming An Artist Nobody Likes was far, far scarier than remaining An Artist Nobody’s Heard Of. At least he was comfortable with and used to being An Artist Nobody’s Heard Of. I had another friend who was a party guy, always going out drinking and chasing girls. After years of living the “high life,” he found himself terribly lonely, depressed, and unhealthy. He wanted to give up his party lifestyle. He spoke with a fierce jealousy of those of us who were in relationships and more “settled down” than he was. Yet he never changed. For years he went on, empty night after empty night, bottle after bottle. Always some excuse. Always some reason he couldn’t slow down. Giving up that lifestyle threatened his identity too much. The Party Guy was all he knew how to be. To give that up would be like committing psychological hara-kiri. We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities. I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others. Kill Yourself Buddhism argues that your idea of who “you” are is an arbitrary mental construction and that you should let go of the idea that “you” exist at all; that the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you, and thus you’re better off letting go of everything. In a sense, you could say that Buddhism encourages you to not give a fuck. It sounds wonky, but there are some psychological benefits to this approach to life. When we let go of the stories we tell about ourselves, to ourselves, we free ourselves up to actually act (and fail) and grow. When someone admits to herself, “You know, maybe I’m not good at relationships,” then she is suddenly free to act and end her bad marriage. She has no identity to protect by staying in a miserable, crappy marriage just to prove something to herself. When the student admits to himself, “You know, maybe I’m not a rebel; maybe I’m just scared,” then he’s free to be ambitious again. He has no reason to feel threatened by pursuing his academic dreams and maybe failing. When the insurance adjuster admits to himself, “You know, maybe there’s nothing unique or special about my dreams or my job,” then he’s free to give that screenplay an honest go and see what happens. I have both some good news and some bad news for you: there is little that is unique or special about your problems. That’s why letting go is so liberating. There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.” This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe. My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator. The narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself, the more everything will seem to threaten you. For that reason, define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible. This often means giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself: that you’re uniquely intelligent, or spectacularly talented, or intimidatingly attractive, or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine. This means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you’re somehow owed something by this world. This means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you’ve been sustaining yourself on for years. Like a junkie giving up the needle, you’re going to go through withdrawal when you start giving these things up. But you’ll come out the other side so much better. How to Be a Little Less Certain of Yourself Questioning ourselves and doubting our own thoughts and beliefs is one of the hardest skills to develop. But it can be done. Here are some questions that will help you breed a little more uncertainty in your life. Question #1: What if I’m wrong? A friend of mine recently got engaged to be married. The guy who proposed to her is pretty solid. He doesn’t drink. He doesn’t hit her or mistreat her. He’s friendly and has a good job. But since the engagement, my friend’s brother has been admonishing her nonstop about her immature life choices, warning her that she’s going to hurt herself with this guy, that she’s making a mistake, that she’s being irresponsible. And whenever my friend asks her brother, “What is your problem? Why does this bother you so much?” he acts as though there is no problem, that nothing about the engagement bothers him, that he’s just trying to be helpful and look out for his little sister. But it’s clear that something does bother him. Perhaps it’s his own insecurities about getting married. Perhaps it’s a sibling rivalry thing. Perhaps it’s jealousy. Perhaps he’s just so caught up in his own victimhood that he doesn’t know how to show happiness for others without trying to make them feel miserable first. As a general rule, we’re all the world’s worst observers of ourselves. When we’re angry, or jealous, or upset, we’re oftentimes the last ones to figure it out. And the only way to figure it out is to put cracks in our armor of certainty by consistently questioning how wrong we might be about ourselves. “Am I jealous—and if I am, then why?” “Am I angry?” “Is she right, and I’m just protecting my ego?” Questions like these need to become a mental habit. In many cases, the simple act of asking ourselves such questions generates the humility and compassion needed to resolve a lot of our issues. But it’s important to note that just because you ask yourself if you have the wrong idea doesn’t necessarily mean that you do. If your husband beats the crap out of you for burning the pot roast and you ask yourself if you’re wrong to believe he’s mistreating you—well, sometimes you’re right. The goal is merely to ask the question and entertain the thought at the moment, not to hate yourself. It’s worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life, you must be wrong about something. If you’re sitting there, miserable day after day, then that means you’re already wrong about something major in your life, and until you’re able to question yourself to find it, nothing will change. Question #2: What would it mean if I were wrong? Many people are able to ask themselves if they’re wrong, but few are able to go the extra step and admit what it would mean if they were wrong. That’s because the potential meaning behind our wrongness is often painful. Not only does it call into question our values, but it forces us to consider what a different, contradictory value could potentially look and feel like. Aristotle wrote, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” Being able to look at and evaluate different values without necessarily adopting them is perhaps the central skill required in changing one’s own life in a meaningful way. As for my friend’s brother, his question to himself should be, “What would it mean if I were wrong about my sister’s wedding?” Often the answer to such a question is pretty straightforward (and some form of “I’m being a selfish/insecure/narcissistic asshole”). If he is wrong, and his sister’s engagement is fine and healthy and happy, there’s really no way to explain his own behavior other than through his own insecurities and fucked-up values. He assumes that he knows what’s best for his sister and that she can’t make major life decisions for herself; he assumes that he has the right and responsibility to make decisions for her; he is certain that he’s right and everyone else must be wrong. Even once uncovered, whether in my friend’s brother or in ourselves, that sort of entitlement is hard to admit. It hurts. That’s why few people ask the difficult questions. But probing questions are necessary in order to get at the core problems that are motivating his, and our, dickish behavior. Question #3: Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others? This is the litmus test for determining whether we’ve got some pretty solid values going on, or we’re totally neurotic fuckwads taking our fucks out on everyone, including ourselves. The goal here is to look at which problem is better. Because after all, as Disappointment Panda said, life’s problems are endless. My friend’s brother, what are his options? A.   Continue causing drama and friction within the family, complicating what should otherwise be a happy moment, and damage the trust and respect he has with his sister, all because he has a hunch (some might call it an intuition) that this guy is bad for her. B.   Mistrust his own ability to determine what’s right or wrong for his sister’s life and remain humble, trust her ability to make her own decisions, and even if he doesn’t, live with the results out of his love and respect for her. Most people choose option A. That’s because option A is the easier path. It requires little thought, no second-guessing, and zero tolerance of decisions other people make that you don’t like. It also creates the most misery for everyone involved. It’s option B that sustains healthy and happy relationships built on trust and respect. It’s option B that forces people to remain humble and admit ignorance. It’s option B that allows people to grow beyond their insecurities and recognize situations where they’re being impulsive or unfair or selfish. But option B is hard and painful, so most people don’t choose it. My friend’s brother, in protesting her engagement, entered into an imaginary battle with himself. Sure, he believed he was trying to protect his sister, but as we’ve seen, beliefs are arbitrary; worse yet, they’re often made up after the fact to justify whatever values and metrics we’ve chosen for ourselves. The truth is, he would rather fuck up his relationship with his sister than consider that he might be wrong—even though the latter could help him to grow out of the insecurities that made him wrong in the first place. I try to live with few rules, but one that I’ve adopted over the years is this: if it’s down to me being screwed up, or everybody else being screwed up, it is far, far, far more likely that I’m the one who’s screwed up. I have learned this from experience. I have been the asshole acting out based on my own insecurities and flawed certainties more times than I can count. It’s not pretty. That’s not to say there aren’t certain ways in which most people are screwed up. And that’s not to say that there aren’t times when you’ll be more right than most other people. That’s simply reality: if it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself.     CHAPTER 7 Failure Is the Way Forward I really mean it when I say it: I was fortunate. I graduated college in 2007, just in time for the financial collapse and Great Recession, and attempted to enter the worst job market in more than eighty years. Around the same time, I found out that the person who was subletting one of the rooms in my apartment hadn’t paid any rent for three months. When confronted about this, she cried and then disappeared, leaving my other roommate and me to cover everything. Goodbye, savings. I spent the next six months living on a friend’s couch, stringing together odd jobs and trying to stay in as little debt as possible while looking for a “real job.” I say I was fortunate because I entered the adult world already a failure. I started out at rock bottom. That’s basically everybody’s biggest fear later on in life, when confronted with starting a new business or changing careers or quitting an awful job, and I got to experience it right out of the gates. Things could only get better. So yeah, lucky. When you’re sleeping on a smelly futon and have to count coins to figure out whether you can afford McDonald’s this week and you’ve sent out twenty résumés without hearing a single word back, then starting a blog and a stupid Internet business doesn’t sound like such a scary idea. If every project I started failed, if every post I wrote went unread, I’d only be back exactly where I started. So why not try? Failure itself is a relative concept. If my metric had been to become an anarcho-communist revolutionary, then my complete failure to make any money between 2007 and 2008 would have been a raving success. But if, like most people, my metric had been to simply find a first serious job that could pay some bills right out of school, I was a dismal failure. I grew up in a wealthy family. Money was never a problem. On the contrary, I grew up in a wealthy family where money was more often used to avoid problems than solve them. I was again fortunate, because this taught me at an early age that making money, by itself, was a lousy metric for myself. You could make plenty of money and be miserable, just as you could be broke and be pretty happy. Therefore, why use money as a means to measure my self-worth? Instead, my value was something else. It was freedom, autonomy. The idea of being an entrepreneur had always appealed to me because I hated being told what to do and preferred to do things my way. The idea of working on the Internet appealed to me because I could do it from anywhere and work whenever I wanted. I asked myself a simple question: “Would I rather make decent money and work a job I hated, or play at Internet entrepreneur and be broke for a while?” The answer was immediate and clear for me: the latter. I then asked myself, “If I try this thing and fail in a few years and have to go get a job anyway, will I have really lost anything?” The answer was no. Instead of a broke and unemployed twenty-two-year-old with no experience, I’d be a broke and unemployed twenty-five-year-old with no experience. Who cares? With this value, to not pursue my own projects became the failure—not a lack of money, not sleeping on friends’ and family’s couches (which I continued to do for most of the next two years), and not an empty résumé. The Failure/Success Paradox When Pablo Picasso was an old man, he was sitting in a café in Spain, doodling on a used napkin. He was nonchalant about the whole thing, drawing whatever amused him in that moment—kind of the same way teenage boys draw penises on bathroom stalls—except this was Picasso, so his bathroom-stall penises were more like cubist/impressionist awesomeness laced on top of faint coffee stains. Anyway, some woman sitting near him was looking on in awe. After a few moments, Picasso finished his coffee and crumpled up the napkin to throw away as he left. The woman stopped him. “Wait,” she said. “Can I have that napkin you were just drawing on? I’ll pay you for it.” “Sure,” Picasso replied. “Twenty thousand dollars.” The woman’s head jolted back as if he had just flung a brick at her. “What? It took you like two minutes to draw that.” “No, ma’am,” Picasso said. “It took me over sixty years to draw this.” He stuffed the napkin in his pocket and walked out of the café. Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. If you think about a young child trying to learn to walk, that child will fall down and hurt itself hundreds of times. But at no point does that child ever stop and think, “Oh, I guess walking just isn’t for me. I’m not good at it.” Avoiding failure is something we learn at some later point in life. I’m sure a lot of it comes from our education system, which judges rigorously based on performance and punishes those who don’t do well. Another large share of it comes from overbearing or critical parents who don’t let their kids screw up on their own often enough, and instead punish them for trying anything new or not preordained. And then we have all the mass media that constantly expose us to stellar success after success, while not showing us the thousands of hours of dull practice and tedium that were required to achieve that success. At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail, where we instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we’re already good at. This confines us and stifles us. We can be truly successful only at something we’re willing to fail at. If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed. A lot of this fear of failure comes from having chosen shitty values. For instance, if I measure myself by the standard “Make everyone I meet like me,” I will be anxious, because failure is 100 percent defined by the actions of others, not by my own actions. I am not in control; thus my self-worth is at the mercy of judgments by others. Whereas if I instead adopt the metric “Improve my social life,” I can live up to my value of “good relations with others” regardless of how other people respond to me. My self-worth is based on my own behaviors and happiness. Shitty values, as we saw in chapter 4, involve tangible external goals outside of our control. The pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety. And even if we manage to achieve them, they leave us feeling empty and lifeless, because once they’re achieved there are no more problems to solve. Better values, as we saw, are process-oriented. Something like “Express myself honestly to others,” a metric for the value “honesty,” is never completely finished; it’s a problem that must continuously be reengaged. Every new conversation, every new relationship, brings new challenges and opportunities for honest expression. The value is an ongoing, lifelong process that defies completion. If your metric for the value “success by worldly standards” is “Buy a house and a nice car,” and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it, once it’s achieved the metric has nothing left to give you. Then say hello to your midlife crisis, because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you. There are no other opportunities to keep growing and improving, and yet it’s growth that generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements. In this sense, goals, as they are conventionally defined—graduate from college, buy a lake house, lose fifteen pounds—are limited in the amount of happiness they can produce in our lives. They may be helpful when pursuing quick, short-term benefits, but as guides for the overall trajectory of our life, they suck. Picasso remained prolific his entire life. He lived into his nineties and continued to produce art up until his final years. Had his metric been “Become famous” or “Make a buttload of money in the art world” or “Paint one thousand pictures,” he would have stagnated at some point along the way. He would have been overcome by anxiety or self-doubt. He likely wouldn’t have improved and innovated his craft in the ways he did decade after decade. The reason for Picasso’s success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a café. His underlying value was simple and humble. And it was endless. It was the value “honest expression.” And this is what made that napkin so valuable. Pain Is Part of the Process In the 1950s, a Polish psychologist named Kazimierz Dabrowski studied World War II survivors and how they’d coped with traumatic experiences in the war. This was Poland, so things had been pretty gruesome. These people had experienced or witnessed mass starvation, bombings that turned cities to rubble, the Holocaust, the torture of prisoners of war, and the rape and/or murder of family members, if not by the Nazis, then a few years later by the Soviets. As Dabrowski studied the survivors, he noticed something both surprising and amazing. A sizable percentage of them believed that the wartime experiences they’d suffered, although painful and indeed traumatic, had actually caused them to become better, more responsible, and yes, even happier people. Many described their lives before the war as if they’d been different people then: ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones, lazy and consumed by petty problems, entitled to all they’d been given. After the war they felt more confident, more sure of themselves, more grateful, and unfazed by life’s trivialities and petty annoyances. Obviously, their experiences had been horrific, and these survivors weren’t happy about having had to experience them. Many of them still suffered from the emotional scars the lashings of war had left on them. But some of them had managed to leverage those scars to transform themselves in positive and powerful ways. And they aren’t alone in that reversal. For many of us, our proudest achievements come in the face of the greatest adversity. Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded. Many cancer survivors, for example, report feeling stronger and more grateful after winning their battle to survive. Many military personnel report a mental resilience gained from withstanding the dangerous environments of being in a war zone. Dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential. Just as one must suffer physical pain to build stronger bone and muscle, one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, increased compassion, and a generally happier life. Our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments. It’s only when we feel intense pain that we’re willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us. We need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we’ve been deriving meaning in our life, and then consider changing course. You could call it “hitting bottom” or “having an existential crisis.” I prefer to call it “weathering the shitstorm.” Choose what suits you. And perhaps you’re in that kind of place right now. Perhaps you’re coming out of the most significant challenge of your life and are bewildered because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite. That’s good—that’s the beginning. I can’t stress this enough, but pain is part of the process. It’s important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change. When I was young, any time my family got a new VCR or stereo, I would press every button, plug and unplug every cord and cable, just to see what everything did. With time, I learned how the whole system worked. And because I knew how it all worked, I was often the only person in the house who used the stuff. As is the case for many millennial children, my parents looked on as if I were some sort of prodigy. To them, the fact that I could program the VCR without looking at the instruction manual made me the Second Coming of Tesla. It’s easy to look back at my parents’ generation and chuckle at their technophobia. But the further I get into adulthood, the more I realize that we all have areas of our lives where we’re like my parents with the new VCR: we sit and stare and shake our heads and say, “But how?” When really, it’s as simple as just doing it. I get emails from people asking questions like this all the time. And for many years, I never knew what to say to them. There’s the girl whose parents are immigrants and saved for their whole lives to put her through med school. But now she’s in med school and she hates it; she doesn’t want to spend her life as a doctor, so she wants to drop out more than anything. Yet she feels stuck. So stuck, in fact, that she ends up emailing a stranger on the Internet (me) and asking him a silly and obvious question like, “How do I drop out of med school?” Or the college guy who has a crush on his tutor. So he agonizes over every sign, every laugh, every smile, every diversion into small talk, and emails me a twenty-eight-page novella that concludes with the question, “How do I ask her out?” Or the single mother whose now-adult kids have finished school and are loafing around on her couch, eating her food, spending her money, not respecting her space or her desire for privacy. She wants them to move on with their lives. She wants to move on with her life. Yet she’s scared to death of pushing her children away, scared to the point of asking, “How do I ask them to move out?” These are VCR questions. From the outside, the answer is simple: just shut up and do it. But from the inside, from the perspective of each of these people, these questions feel impossibly complex and opaque—existential riddles wrapped in enigmas packed in a KFC bucket full of Rubik’s Cubes. VCR questions are funny because the answer appears difficult to anyone who has them and appears easy to anyone who does not. The problem here is pain. Filling out the appropriate paperwork to drop out of med school is a straightforward and obvious action; breaking your parents’ hearts is not. Asking a tutor out on a date is as simple as saying the words; risking intense embarrassment and rejection feels far more complicated. Asking someone to move out of your house is a clear decision; feeling as if you’re abandoning your own children is not. I struggled with social anxiety throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life. I spent most of my days distracting myself with video games and most of my nights either drinking or smoking away my uneasiness. For many years, the thought of speaking to a stranger—especially if that stranger happened to be particularly attractive/interesting/popular/smart—felt impossible to me. I walked around in a daze for years, asking myself dumb VCR questions: “How? How do you just walk up and talk to a person? How can somebody do that?” I had all sorts of screwed-up beliefs about this, like that you weren’t allowed to speak to someone unless you had some practical reason to, or that women would think I was a creepy rapist if I so much as said, “Hello.” The problem was that my emotions defined my reality. Because it felt like people didn’t want to talk to me, I came to believe that people didn’t want to talk to me. And thus, my VCR question: “How do you just walk up and talk to a person?” Because I failed to separate what I felt from what was, I was incapable of stepping outside myself and seeing the world for what it was: a simple place where two people can walk up to each other at any time and speak. Many people, when they feel some form of pain or anger or sadness, drop everything and attend to numbing out whatever they’re feeling. Their goal is to get back to “feeling good” again as quickly as possible, even if that means substances or deluding themselves or returning to their shitty values. Learn to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it. I won’t lie: this is going to feel impossibly hard at first. But you can start simple. You’re going to feel as though you don’t know what to do. But we’ve discussed this: you don’t know anything. Even when you think you do, you really don’t know what the fuck you’re doing. So really, what is there to lose? Life is about not knowing and then doing something anyway. All of life is like this. It never changes. Even when you’re happy. Even when you’re farting fairy dust. Even when you win the lottery and buy a small fleet of Jet Skis, you still won’t know what the hell you’re doing. Don’t ever forget that. And don’t ever be afraid of that. The “Do Something” Principle In 2008, after holding down a day job for all of six weeks, I gave up on the whole job thing to pursue an online business. At the time, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing, but I figured if I was going to be broke and miserable, I might as well be while working on my own terms. And at that time, all I seemed to really care about was chasing girls. So fuck it, I decided to start a blog about my crazy dating life. That first morning that I woke up self-employed, terror quickly consumed me. I found myself sitting with my laptop and realized, for the first time, that I was entirely responsible for all of my own decisions, as well as the consequences of those decisions. I was responsible for teaching myself web design, Internet marketing, search engine optimization, and other esoteric topics. It was all on my shoulders now. And so I did what any twenty-four-year-old who’d just quit his job and had no idea what he was doing would do: I downloaded some computer games and avoided work like it was the Ebola virus. As the weeks went on and my bank account turned from black to red, it was clear that I needed to come up with some sort of strategy to get myself to put in the twelve- or fourteen-hour days that were necessary to get a new business off the ground. And that plan came from an unexpected place. When I was in high school, my math teacher Mr. Packwood used to say, “If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.” During that early self-employment period, when I struggled every day, completely clueless about what to do and terrified of the results (or lack thereof), Mr. Packwood’s advice started beckoning me from the recesses of my mind. I heard it like a mantra: Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow. In the course of applying Mr. Packwood’s advice, I learned a powerful lesson about motivation. It took about eight years for this lesson to sink in, but what I discovered, over those long, grueling months of bombed product launches, laughable advice columns, uncomfortable nights on friends’ couches, overdrawn bank accounts, and hundreds of thousands of words written (most of them unread), was perhaps the most important thing I’ve ever learned in my life: Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it. Most of us commit to action only if we feel a certain level of motivation. And we feel motivation only when we feel enough emotional inspiration. We assume that these steps occur in a sort of chain reaction, like this: Emotional inspiration → Motivation → Desirable action If you want to accomplish something but don’t feel motivated or inspired, then you assume you’re just screwed. There’s nothing you can do about it. It’s not until a major emotional life event occurs that you can generate enough motivation to actually get off the couch and do something. The thing about motivation is that it’s not only a three-part chain, but an endless loop: Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Etc. Your actions create further emotional reactions and inspirations and move on to motivate your future actions. Taking advantage of this knowledge, we can actually reorient our mindset in the following way: Action → Inspiration → Motivation If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something—anything, really—and then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself. I call this the “do something” principle. After using it myself to build my business, I began teaching it to readers who came to me perplexed by their own VCR questions: “How do I apply for a job?” or “How do I tell this guy I want to be his girlfriend?” and the like. During the first couple years I worked for myself, entire weeks would go by without my accomplishing much, for no other reason than that I was anxious and stressed about what I had to do, and it was too easy to put everything off. I quickly learned, though, that forcing myself to do something, even the most menial of tasks, quickly made the larger tasks seem much easier. If I had to redesign an entire website, I’d force myself to sit down and would say, “Okay, I’ll just design the header right now.” But after the header was done, I’d find myself moving on to other parts of the site. And before I knew it, I’d be energized and engaged in the project. The author Tim Ferriss relates a story he once heard about a novelist who had written over seventy novels. Someone asked the novelist how he was able to write so consistently and remain inspired and motivated. He replied, “Two hundred crappy words per day, that’s it.” The idea was that if he forced himself to write two hundred crappy words, more often than not the act of writing would inspire him; and before he knew it, he’d have thousands of words down on the page. If we follow the “do something” principle, failure feels unimportant. When the standard of success becomes merely acting—when any result is regarded as progress and important, when inspiration is seen as a reward rather than a prerequisite—we propel ourselves ahead. We feel free to fail, and that failure moves us forward. The “do something” principle not only helps us overcome procrastination, but it’s also the process by which we adopt new values. If you’re in the midst of an existential shitstorm and everything feels meaningless—if all the ways you used to measure yourself have come up short and you have no idea what’s next, if you know that you’ve been hurting yourself chasing false dreams, or if you know that there’s some better metric you should be measuring yourself with but you don’t know how—the answer is the same: Do something. That “something” can be the smallest viable action toward something else. It can be anything. Recognize that you’ve been an entitled prick in all of your relationships and want to start developing more compassion for others? Do something. Start simple. Make it a goal to listen to someone’s problem and give some of your time to helping that person. Just do it once. Or promise yourself that you will assume that you are the root of your problems next time you get upset. Just try on the idea and see how it feels. That’s often all that’s necessary to get the snowball rolling, the action needed to inspire the motivation to keep going. You can become your own source of inspiration. You can become your own source of motivation. Action is always within reach. And with simply doing something as your only metric for success—well, then even failure pushes you forward.     CHAPTER 8 The Importance of Saying No In 2009, I gathered up all my possessions, sold them or put them into storage, left my apartment, and set off for Latin America. By this time my little dating advice blog was getting some traffic and I was actually making a modest amount of money selling PDFs and courses online. I planned on spending much of the next few years living abroad, experiencing new cultures, and taking advantage of the lower cost of living in a number of developing countries in Asia and Latin America to build my business further. It was the digital nomad dream and as a twenty-five-year-old adventure-seeker, it was exactly what I wanted out of life. But as sexy and heroic as my plan sounded, not all of the values driving me to this nomadic lifestyle were healthy ones. Sure, I had some admirable values going on—a thirst to see the world, a curiosity for people and culture, some old-fashioned adventure-seeking. But there also existed a faint outline of shame underlying everything else. At the time I was hardly aware of it, but if I was completely honest with myself, I knew there was a screwed-up value lurking there, somewhere beneath the surface. I couldn’t see it, but in quiet moments when I was completely honest with myself, I could feel it. Along with the entitlement of my early twenties, the “real traumatic shit” of my teenage years had left me with a nice bundle of commitment issues. I had spent the past few years overcompensating for the inadequacy and social anxiety of my teenager years, and as a result I felt like I could meet anybody I wanted, be friends with anybody I wanted, love anybody I wanted, have sex with anybody I wanted—so why would I ever commit to a single person, or even a single social group, a single city or country or culture? If I could experience everything equally, then I should experience them all equally, right? Armed with this grandiose sense of connectivity to the world, I bounced back and forth across countries and oceans in a game of global hopscotch that lasted over five years. I visited fifty-five countries, made dozens of friends, and found myself in the arms of a number of lovers—all of whom were quickly replaced and some of whom were already forgotten by the next flight to the next country. It was a strange life, replete with fantastic, horizon-breaching experiences as well as superficial highs designed to numb my underlying pain. It seemed both so profound yet so meaningless at the same time, and still does. Some of my greatest life lessons and character-defining moments came on the road during this period. But some of the biggest wastes of my time and energy came during this period as well. Now I live in New York. I have a house and furniture and an electric bill and a wife. None of it is particularly glamorous or exciting. And I like it that way. Because after all the years of excitement, the biggest lesson I took from my adventuring was this: absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing. Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it. Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or (gulp) one person. This realization came to me slowly over the course of my years traveling. As with most excesses in life, you have to drown yourself in them to realize that they don’t make you happy. Such was traveling with me. As I drowned in my fifty-third, fifty-fourth, fifty-fifth country, I began to understand that while all of my experiences were exciting and great, few of them would have any lasting significance. Whereas my friends back home were settling down into marriages, buying houses, and giving their time to interesting companies or political causes, I was floundering from one high to the next. In 2011, I traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia. The food sucked. The weather sucked. (Snow in May? Are you fucking kidding me?) My apartment sucked. Nothing worked. Everything was overpriced. The people were rude and smelled funny. Nobody smiled and everyone drank too much. Yet, I loved it. It was one of my favorite trips. There’s a bluntness to Russian culture that generally rubs Westerners the wrong way. Gone are the fake niceties and verbal webs of politeness. You don’t smile at strangers or pretend to like anything you don’t. In Russia, if something is stupid, you say it’s stupid. If someone is being an asshole, you tell him he’s being an asshole. If you really like someone and are having a great time, you tell her that you like her and are having a great time. It doesn’t matter if this person is your friend, a stranger, or someone you met five minutes ago on the street. The first week I found all of this really uncomfortable. I went on a coffee date with a Russian girl, and within three minutes of sitting down she looked at me funny and told me that what I’d just said was stupid. I nearly choked on my drink. There was nothing combative about the way she said it; it was spoken as if it were some mundane fact—like the quality of the weather that day, or her shoe size—but I was still shocked. After all, in the West such outspokenness is seen as highly offensive, especially from someone you just met. But it went on like this with everyone. Everyone came across as rude all the time, and as a result, my Western-coddled mind felt attacked on all sides. Nagging insecurities began to surface in situations where they hadn’t existed in years. But as the weeks wore on, I got used to the Russian frankness, much as I did the midnight sunsets and the vodka that went down like ice water. And then I started appreciating it for what it really was: unadulterated expression. Honesty in the truest sense of the word. Communication with no conditions, no strings attached, no ulterior motive, no sales job, no desperate attempt to be liked. Somehow, after years of travel, it was in perhaps the most un-American of places where I first experienced a particular flavor of freedom: the ability to say whatever I thought or felt, without fear of repercussion. It was a strange form of liberation through accepting rejection. And as someone who had been starved of this kind of blunt expression most of his life—first by an emotionally repressed family life, then later by a meticulously constructed false display of confidence—I got drunk on it like, well, like it was the finest damn vodka I’d ever had. The month I spent in Saint Petersburg went by in a blur, and by the end I didn’t want to leave. Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves. This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it’s not necessarily the best way to live. In this case, Russia had me reexamining the bullshitty, fake-nice communication that is so common in Anglo culture, and asking myself if this wasn’t somehow making us more insecure around each other and worse at intimacy. I remember discussing this dynamic with my Russian teacher one day, and he had an interesting theory. Having lived under communism for so many generations, with little to no economic opportunity and caged by a culture of fear, Russian society found the most valuable currency to be trust. And to build trust you have to be honest. That means when things suck, you say so openly and without apology. People’s displays of unpleasant honesty were rewarded for the simple fact that they were necessary for survival—you had to know whom you could rely on and whom you couldn’t, and you needed to know quickly. But, in the “free” West, my Russian teacher continued, there existed an abundance of economic opportunity—so much economic opportunity that it became far more valuable to present yourself in a certain way, even if it was false, than to actually be that way. Trust lost its value. Appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expression. Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely. This is why it became the norm in Western cultures to smile and say polite things even when you don’t feel like it, to tell little white lies and agree with someone whom you don’t actually agree with. This is why people learn to pretend to be friends with people they don’t actually like, to buy things they don’t actually want. The economic system promotes such deception. The downside of this is that you never know, in the West, if you can completely trust the person you’re talking to. Sometimes this is the case even among good friends or family members. There is such pressure in the West to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they’re dealing with. Rejection Makes Your Life Better As an extension of our positivity/consumer culture, many of us have been “indoctrinated” with the belief that we should try to be as inherently accepting and affirmative as possible. This is a cornerstone of many of the so-called positive thinking books: open yourself up to opportunities, be accepting, say yes to everything and everyone, and so on. But we need to reject something. Otherwise, we stand for nothing. If nothing is better or more desirable than anything else, then we are empty and our life is meaningless. We are without values and therefore live our life without any purpose. The avoidance of rejection (both giving and receiving it) is often sold to us as a way to make ourselves feel better. But avoiding rejection gives us short-term pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term. To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. There’s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you’ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting the alternatives. The act of choosing a value for yourself requires rejecting alternative values. If I choose to make my marriage the most important part of my life, that means I’m (probably) choosing not to make cocaine-fueled hooker orgies an important part of my life. If I’m choosing to judge myself based on my ability to have open and accepting friendships, that means I’m rejecting trashing my friends behind their backs. These are all healthy decisions, yet they require rejection at every turn. The point is this: we all must give a fuck about something, in order to value something. And to value something, we must reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X. That rejection is an inherent and necessary part of maintaining our values, and therefore our identity. We are defined by what we choose to reject. And if we reject nothing (perhaps in fear of being rejected by something ourselves), we essentially have no identity at all. The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away. Rejection is an important and crucial life skill. Nobody wants to be stuck in a relationship that isn’t making them happy. Nobody wants to be stuck in a business doing work they hate and don’t believe in. Nobody wants to feel that they can’t say what they really mean. Yet people choose these things. All the time. Honesty is a natural human craving. But part of having honesty in our lives is becoming comfortable with saying and hearing the word “no.” In this way, rejection actually makes our relationships better and our emotional lives healthier. Boundaries Once upon a time, there were two youngsters, a boy and a girl. Their families hated each other. But the boy snuck into a party hosted by the girl’s family because he was kind of a dick. The girl sees the boy, and angels sing so sweetly to her lady-parts that she instantly falls in love with him. Just like that. And so he sneaks into her garden and they decide to get married the next freaking day, because, you know, that’s totally practical, especially when your parents want to murder each other. Jump ahead a few days. Their families find out about the marriage and throw a shit-fit. Mercutio dies. The girl is so upset that she drinks a potion that will put her to sleep for two days. But, unfortunately, the young couple hasn’t learned the ins and outs of good marital communication yet, and the young girl totally forgets to mention something about it to her new husband. The young man therefore mistakes his new wife’s self-induced coma for suicide. He then totally loses his marbles and he commits suicide, thinking he’s going to be with her in the afterlife or some shit. But then she wakes up from her two-day coma, only to learn that her new husband has committed suicide, so she has the exact same idea and kills herself too. The end. Romeo and Juliet is synonymous with “romance” in our culture today. It is seen as the love story in English-speaking culture, an emotional ideal to live up to. Yet when you really get down to what happens in the story, these kids are absolutely out of their fucking minds. And they just killed themselves to prove it! It’s suspected by many scholars that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance, but rather to satirize it, to show how absolutely nutty it was. He didn’t mean for the play to be a glorification of love. In fact, he meant it to be the opposite: a big flashing neon sign blinking KEEP OUT, with police tape around it saying DO NOT CROSS. For most of human history, romantic love was not celebrated as it is now. In fact, up until the mid-nineteenth century or so, love was seen as an unnecessary and potentially dangerous psychological impediment to the more important things in life—you know, like farming well and/or marrying a guy with a lot of sheep. Young people were often forcibly steered clear of their romantic passions in favor of practical economic marriages that would yield stability for both them and their families. But today, we all get brain boners for this kind of batshit crazy love. It dominates our culture. And the more dramatic, the better. Whether it’s Ben Affleck working to destroy an asteroid to save the earth for the girl he loves, or Mel Gibson murdering hundreds of Englishmen and fantasizing about his raped and murdered wife while being tortured to death, or that Elven chick giving up her immortality to be with Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, or stupid romantic comedies where Jimmy Fallon forgoes his Red Sox playoff tickets because Drew Barrymore has, like, needs or something. If this sort of romantic love were cocaine, then as a culture we’d all be like Tony Montana in Scarface: burying our faces in a fucking mountain of it, screaming, “Say hello to my lee-tle friend!” The problem is that we’re finding out that romantic love is kind of like cocaine. Like, frighteningly similar to cocaine. Like, stimulates the exact same parts of your brain as cocaine. Like, gets you high and makes you feel good for a while but also creates as many problems as it solves, as does cocaine. Most elements of romantic love that we pursue—the dramatic and dizzyingly emotional displays of affection, the topsy-turvy ups and downs—aren’t healthy, genuine displays of love. In fact, they’re often just another form of entitlement playing out through people’s relationships. I know: that makes me sound like such a downer. Seriously, what kind of guy shits on romantic love? But hear me out. The truth is, there are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love. Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other—in other words, they’re using each other as an escape. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support. The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner. Anywhere there is an unhealthy or toxic relationship, there will be a poor and porous sense of responsibility on both sides, and there will be an inability to give and/or receive rejection. Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary. By “boundaries” I mean the delineation between two people’s responsibilities for their own problems. People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner’s problems. What do poor boundaries look like? Here are some examples: “You can’t go out with your friends without me. You know how jealous I get. You have to stay home with me.” “My coworkers are idiots; they always make me late to meetings because I have to tell them how to do their jobs.” “I can’t believe you made me feel so stupid in front of my own sister. Never disagree with me in front of her again!” “I’d love to take that job in Milwaukee, but my mother would never forgive me for moving so far away.” “I can date you, but can you not tell my friend Cindy? She gets really insecure when I have a boyfriend and she doesn’t.” In each scenario, the person is either taking responsibility for problems/emotions that are not theirs, or demanding that someone else take responsibility for their problems/emotions. In general, entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships. Either they expect other people to take responsibility for their problems: “I wanted a nice relaxing weekend at home. You should have known that and canceled your plans.” Or they take on too much responsibility for other people’s problems: “She just lost her job again, but it’s probably my fault because I wasn’t as supportive of her as I could have been. I’m going to help her rewrite her résumé tomorrow.” Entitled people adopt these strategies in their relationships, as with everything, to help avoid accepting responsibility for their own problems. As a result, their relationships are fragile and fake, products of avoiding inner pain rather than embracing a genuine appreciation and adoration of their partner. This goes not just for romantic relationships, by the way, but also for family relationships and friendships. An overbearing mother may take responsibility for every problem in her children’s lives. Her own entitlement then encourages an entitlement in her children, as they grow up to believe other people should always be responsible for their problems. (This is why the problems in your romantic relationships always eerily resemble the problems in your parents’ relationship.) When you have murky areas of responsibility for your emotions and actions—areas where it’s unclear who is responsible for what, whose fault is what, why you’re doing what you’re doing—you never develop strong values for yourself. Your only value becomes making your partner happy. Or your only value becomes your partner making you happy. This is self-defeating, of course. And relationships characterized by such murkiness usually go down like the Hindenburg, with all the drama and fireworks. People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other’s problems in order to feel good about themselves. Rather, a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other. The setting of proper boundaries doesn’t mean you can’t help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself. You both should support each other. But only because you choose to support and be supported. Not because you feel obligated or entitled. Entitled people who blame others for their own emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they constantly paint themselves as victims, eventually someone will come along and save them, and they will receive the love they’ve always wanted. Entitled people who take the blame for other people’s emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they “fix” their partner and save him or her, they will receive the love and appreciation they’ve always wanted. These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important. These two types of people are drawn strongly to one another, and they usually end up together. Their pathologies match one another perfectly. Often they’ve grown up with parents who each exhibit one of these traits as well. So their model for a “happy” relationship is one based on entitlement and poor boundaries. Sadly, they both fail in meeting the other’s actual needs. In fact, their pattern of overblaming and overaccepting blame perpetuates the entitlement and shitty self-worth that have been keeping them from getting their emotional needs met in the first place. The victim creates more and more problems to solve—not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves. The saver solves and solves—not because she actually cares about the problems, but because she believes she must fix others’ problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself. In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced. The victim, if he really loved the saver, would say, “Look, this is my problem; you don’t have to fix it for me. Just support me while I fix it myself.” That would actually be a demonstration of love: taking responsibility for your own problems and not holding your partner responsible for them. If the saver really wanted to save the victim, the saver would say, “Look, you’re blaming others for your own problems; deal with this yourself.” And in a sick way, that would actually be a demonstration of love: helping someone solve their own problems. Instead, victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs. It’s like an addiction they fulfill in one another. Ironically, when presented with emotionally healthy people to date, they usually feel bored or lack “chemistry” with them. They pass on emotionally healthy, secure individuals because the secure partner’s solid boundaries don’t feel “exciting” enough to stimulate the constant highs necessary in the entitled person. For victims, the hardest thing to do in the world is to hold themselves accountable for their problems. They’ve spent their whole life believing that others are responsible for their fate. That first step of taking responsibility for themselves is often terrifying. For savers, the hardest thing to do in the world is to stop taking responsibility for other people’s problems. They’ve spent their whole life feeling valued and loved only when they’re saving somebody else—so letting go of this need is terrifying to them as well. If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations. It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily. So here’s a litmus test: ask yourself, “If I refused, how would the relationship change?” Similarly, ask, “If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?” If the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates, then that’s a bad sign for your relationship. It suggests that your relationship is conditional—based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other (along with each other’s problems). People with strong boundaries are not afraid of a temper tantrum, an argument, or getting hurt. People with weak boundaries are terrified of those things and will constantly mold their own behavior to fit the highs and lows of their relational emotional roller coaster. People with strong boundaries understand that it’s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has. People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone’s feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can’t determine how other people feel. People with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another’s emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems. It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby. How to Build Trust My wife is one of those women who spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. She loves to look amazing, and I love for her to look amazing too (obviously). Nights before we go out, she comes out of the bathroom after an hour-long makeup/hair/clothes/whatever-women-do-in-there session and asks me how she looks. She’s usually gorgeous. Every once in a while, though, she looks bad. Maybe she tried to do something new with her hair, or decided to wear a pair of boots that some flamboyant fashion designer from Milan thought were avant-garde. Whatever the reason—it just doesn’t work. When I tell her this, she usually gets pissed off. As she marches back into the closet or the bathroom to redo everything and make us thirty minutes late, she spouts a bunch of four-letter words and sometimes even slings a few of them in my direction. Men stereotypically lie in this situation to make their girlfriends/wives happy. But I don’t. Why? Because honesty in my relationship is more important to me than feeling good all the time. The last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love. Fortunately, I’m married to a woman who agrees and is willing to hear my uncensored thoughts. She calls me out on my bullshit too, of course, which is one of the most important traits she offers me as a partner. Sure, my ego gets bruised sometimes, and I bitch and complain and try to argue, but a few hours later I come sulking back and admit that she was right. And holy crap she makes me a better person, even though I hate hearing it at the time. When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good, then nobody ends up feeling good. And our relationship falls apart without our even knowing it. Without conflict, there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits. No one trusts a yes-man. If Disappointment Panda were here, he’d tell you that the pain in our relationship is necessary to cement our trust in each other and produce greater intimacy. For a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no. Without that negation, without that occasional rejection, boundaries break down and one person’s problems and values come to dominate the other’s. Conflict is not only normal, then; it’s absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship. If two people who are close are not able to hash out their differences openly and vocally, then the relationship is based on manipulation and misrepresentation, and it will slowly become toxic. Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything. A person could tell you that she loves you, wants to be with you, would give up everything for you, but if you don’t trust her, you get no benefit from those statements. You don’t feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed toward you comes without any special conditions or baggage attached to it. This is what’s so destructive about cheating. It’s not about the sex. It’s about the trust that has been destroyed as a result of the sex. Without trust, the relationship can no longer function. So it’s either rebuild the trust or say your goodbyes. I often get emails from people who have been cheated on by their significant other but want to stay with that partner and are wondering how they can trust him or her again. Without trust, they tell me, the relationship has begun to feel like a burden, like a threat that must be monitored and questioned rather than enjoyed. The problem here is that most people who get caught cheating apologize and give the “It will never happen again” spiel and that’s that, as if penises fell into various orifices completely by accident. Many cheatees accept this response at face value, and don’t question the values and fucks given by their partner (pun totally intended); they don’t ask themselves whether those values and fucks make their partner a good person to stay with. They’re so concerned with holding on to their relationship that they fail to recognize that it’s become a black hole consuming their self-respect. If people cheat, it’s because something other than the relationship is more important to them. It may be power over others. It may be validation through sex. It may be giving in to their own impulses. Whatever it is, it’s clear that the cheater’s values are not aligned in a way to support a healthy relationship. And if the cheater doesn’t admit this or come to terms with it, if he just gives the old “I don’t know what I was thinking; I was stressed out and drunk and she was there” response, then he lacks the serious self-awareness necessary to solve any relationship problems. What needs to happen is that cheaters have to start peeling away at their self-awareness onion and figure out what fucked-up values caused them to break the trust of the relationship (and whether they actually still value the relationship). They need to be able to say, “You know what: I am selfish. I care about myself more than the relationship; to be honest, I don’t really respect the relationship much at all.” If cheaters can’t express their shitty values, and show that those values have been overridden, then there’s no reason to believe that they can be trusted. And if they can’t be trusted, then the relationship is not going to get better or change. The other factor in regaining trust after it’s been broken is a practical one: a track record. If someone breaks your trust, words are nice; but you then need to see a consistent track record of improved behavior. Only then can you begin trusting that the cheater’s values are now aligned properly and the person really will change. Unfortunately, building a track record for trust takes time—certainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust. And during that trust-building period, things are likely to be pretty shitty. So both people in the relationship must be conscious of the struggle they’re choosing to undertake. I use the example of cheating in a romantic relationship, but this process applies to a breach in any relationship. When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place. Trust is like a china plate. If you break it once, with some care and attention you can put it back together again. But if you break it again, it splits into even more pieces and it takes far longer to piece together again. If you break it more and more times, eventually it shatters to the point where it’s impossible to restore. There are too many broken pieces, and too much dust. Freedom Through Commitment Consumer culture is very good at making us want more, more, more. Underneath all the hype and marketing is the implication that more is always better. I bought into this idea for years. Make more money, visit more countries, have more experiences, be with more women. But more is not always better. In fact, the opposite is true. We are actually often happier with less. When we’re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice. Basically, the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting. So if you have a choice between two places to live and pick one, you’ll likely feel confident and comfortable that you made the right choice. You’ll be satisfied with your decision. But if you have a choice among twenty-eight places to live and pick one, the paradox of choice says that you’ll likely spend years agonizing, doubting, and second-guessing yourself, wondering if you really made the “right” choice, and if you’re truly maximizing your own happiness. And this anxiety, this desire for certainty and perfection and success, will make you unhappy. So what do we do? Well, if you’re like I used to be, you avoid choosing anything at all. You aim to keep your options open as long as possible. You avoid commitment. But while investing deeply in one person, one place, one job, one activity might deny us the breadth of experience we’d like, pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience. There are some experiences that you can have only when you’ve lived in the same place for five years, when you’ve been with the same person for over a decade, when you’ve been working on the same skill or craft for half your lifetime. Now that I’m in my thirties, I can finally recognize that commitment, in its own way, offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never be available to me, no matter where I went or what I did. When you’re pursuing a wide breadth of experience, there are diminishing returns to each new adventure, each new person or thing. When you’ve never left your home country, the first country you visit inspires a massive perspective shift, because you have such a narrow experience base to draw on. But when you’ve been to twenty countries, the twenty-first adds little. And when you’ve been to fifty, the fifty-first adds even less. The same goes for material possessions, money, hobbies, jobs, friends, and romantic/sexual partners—all the lame superficial values people choose for themselves. The older you get, the more experienced you get, the less significantly each new experience affects you. The first time I drank at a party was exciting. The hundredth time was fun. The five hundredth time felt like a normal weekend. And the thousandth time felt boring and unimportant. The big story for me personally over the past few years has been my ability to open myself up to commitment. I’ve chosen to reject all but the very best people and experiences and values in my life. I shut down all my business projects and decided to focus on writing full-time. Since then, my website has become more popular than I’d ever imagined possible. I’ve committed to one woman for the long haul and, to my surprise, have found this more rewarding than any of the flings, trysts, and one-night stands I had in the past. I’ve committed to a single geographic location and doubled down on the handful of my significant, genuine, healthy friendships. And what I’ve discovered is something entirely counterintuitive: that there is a freedom and liberation in commitment. I’ve found increased opportunity and upside in rejecting alternatives and distractions in favor of what I’ve chosen to let truly matter to me. Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would. In this way, the rejection of alternatives liberates us—rejection of what does not align with our most important values, with our chosen metrics, rejection of the constant pursuit of breadth without depth. Yes, breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you’re young—after all, you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried. And you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle—in everything.    CHAPTER 9 . . . And Then You Die Seek the truth for yourself, and I will meet you there.” That was the last thing Josh ever said to me. He said it ironically, attempting to sound deep while simultaneously making fun of people who attempt to sound deep. He was drunk and high. And he was a good friend. The most transformational moment of my life occurred when I was nineteen years old. My friend Josh had taken me to a party on a lake just north of Dallas, Texas. There were condos on a hill and below the hill was a pool, and below the pool was a cliff overlooking the lake. It was a small cliff, maybe thirty feet high—certainly high enough to give you a second thought about jumping, but low enough that with the right combination of alcohol and peer pressure that second thought could easily vanish. Shortly after arriving at the party, Josh and I sat in the pool together, drinking beers and talking as young angsty males do. We talked about drinking and bands and girls and all of the cool stuff Josh had done that summer since dropping out of music school. We talked about playing in a band together and moving to New York City—an impossible dream at the time. We were just kids. “Is it okay to jump off that?” I asked after a while, nodding toward the cliff over the lake. “Yeah,” Josh said, “people do it all the time here.” “Are you going to do it?” He shrugged. “Maybe. We’ll see.” Later in the evening, Josh and I got separated. I had become distracted by a pretty Asian girl who liked video games, which to me, as a teenage nerd, was akin to winning the lottery. She had no interest in me, but she was friendly and happy to let me talk, so I talked. After a few beers, I gathered enough courage to ask her to go up to the house with me to get some food. She said sure. As we walked up the hill, we bumped into Josh coming down. I asked him if he wanted food, but he declined. I asked him where I could find him later on. He smiled and said, “Seek the truth for yourself, and I will meet you there!” I nodded and made a serious face. “Okay, I’ll see you there,” I replied, as if everyone knew exactly where the truth was and how to get to it. Josh laughed and walked down the hill toward the cliff. I laughed and continued up the hill toward the house. I don’t remember how long I was inside. I just remember that when the girl and I came out again, everyone was gone and there were sirens. The pool was empty. People were running down the hill toward the shoreline below the cliff. There were others already down by the water. I could make out a couple guys swimming around. It was dark and hard to see. The music droned on, but nobody listened. Still not putting two-and-two together, I hurried down to the shoreline, gnawing on my sandwich, curious as to what everyone was looking at. Halfway down, the pretty Asian girl said to me, “I think something terrible has happened.” When I got to the bottom of the hill, I asked someone where Josh was. No one looked at me or acknowledged me. Everyone stared at the water. I asked again, and a girl started crying uncontrollably. That’s when I put two-and-two together. It took scuba divers three hours to find Josh’s body at the bottom of the lake. The autopsy would later say that his legs had cramped up due to dehydration from the alcohol, as well as to the impact of the jump from the cliff. It was dark out when he went in, the water layered on the night, black on black. No one could see where his screams for help were coming from. Just the splashes. Just the sounds. His parents later told me that he was a terrible swimmer. I’d had no idea. It took me twelve hours to let myself cry. I was in my car, driving back home to Austin the next morning. I called my dad and told him that I was still near Dallas and that I was going to miss work. (I’d been working for him that summer.) He asked, “Why; what happened? Is everything all right?” And that’s when it all came out: the waterworks. The wails and the screams and the snot. I pulled the car over to the side of the road and clutched the phone and cried the way a little boy cries to his father. I went into a deep depression that summer. I thought I’d been depressed before, but this was a whole new level of meaninglessness—sadness so deep that it physically hurt. People would come by and try to cheer me up, and I would sit there and hear them say all the right things and do all the right things; and I would tell them thank you and how nice it was of them to come over, and I would fake a smile and lie and say that it was getting better, but underneath I just felt nothing. I dreamed about Josh for a few months after that. Dreams where he and I would have full-blown conversations about life and death, as well as about random, pointless things. Up until that point in my life, I had been a pretty typical middle-class stoner kid: lazy, irresponsible, socially anxious, and deeply insecure. Josh, in many ways, had been a person I looked up to. He was older, more confident, more experienced, and more accepting of and open to the world around him. In one of my last dreams of Josh, I was sitting in a Jacuzzi with him (yeah, I know, weird), and I said something like, “I’m really sorry you died.” He laughed. I don’t remember exactly what his words were, but he said something like, “Why do you care that I’m dead when you’re still so afraid to live?” I woke up crying. It was sitting on my mom’s couch that summer, staring into the so-called abyss, seeing the endless and incomprehensible nothingness where Josh’s friendship used to be, when I came to the startling realization that if there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to not do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a bunch of nothing anyway; and that by spending the majority of my short life avoiding what was painful and uncomfortable, I had essentially been avoiding being alive at all. That summer, I gave up the weed and the cigarettes and the video games. I gave up my silly rock star fantasies and dropped out of music school and signed up for college courses. I started going to the gym and lost a bunch of weight. I made new friends. I got my first girlfriend. For the first time in my life I actually studied for classes, gaining me the startling realization that I could make good grades if only I gave a shit. The next summer, I challenged myself to read fifty nonfiction books in fifty days, and then did it. The following year, I transferred to an excellent university on the other side of the country, where I excelled for the first time, both academically and socially. Josh’s death marks the clearest before/after point I can identify in my life. Pre-tragedy, I was inhibited, unambitious, forever obsessed and confined by what I imagined the world might be thinking of me. Post-tragedy, I morphed into a new person: responsible, curious,hardworking. I still had my insecurities and my baggage—as we always do—but now I gave a fuck about something more important than my insecurities and my baggage. And that made all the difference. Oddly, it was someone else’s death that gave me permission to finally live. And perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational. Death scares us. And because it scares us, we avoid thinking about it, talking about it, sometimes even acknowledging it, even when it’s happening to someone close to us. Yet, in a bizarre, backwards way, death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero. Something Beyond Our Selves Ernest Becker was an academic outcast. In 1960, he got his Ph.D. in anthropology; his doctoral research compared the unlikely and unconventional practices of Zen Buddhism and psychoanalysis. At the time, Zen was seen as something for hippies and drug addicts, and Freudian psychoanalysis was considered a quack form of psychology left over from the Stone Age. In his first job as an assistant professor, Becker quickly fell into a crowd that denounced the practice of psychiatry as a form of fascism. They saw the practice as an unscientific form of oppression against the weak and helpless. The problem was that Becker’s boss was a psychiatrist. So it was kind of like walking into your first job and proudly comparing your boss to Hitler. As you can imagine, he was fired. So Becker took his radical ideas somewhere that they might be accepted: Berkeley, California. But this, too, didn’t last long. Because it wasn’t just his anti-establishment tendencies that got Becker into trouble; it was his odd teaching methods as well. He would use Shakespeare to teach psychology, psychology textbooks to teach anthropology, and anthropological data to teach sociology. He’d dress up as King Lear and do mock sword fights in class and go on long political rants that had little to do with the lesson plan. His students adored him. The other faculty loathed him. Less than a year later, he was fired again. Becker then landed at San Francisco State University, where he actually kept his job for more than a year. But when student protests erupted over the Vietnam War, the university called in the National Guard and things got violent. When Becker sided with the students and publicly condemned the actions of the dean (again, his boss being Hitleresque and everything), he was, once again, promptly fired. Becker changed jobs four times in six years. And before he could get fired from the fifth, he got colon cancer. The prognosis was grim. He spent the next few years bedridden and had little hope of surviving. So Becker decided to write a book. This book would be about death. Becker died in 1974. His book The Denial of Death, would win the Pulitzer Prize and become one of the most influential intellectual works of the twentieth century, shaking up the fields of psychology and anthropology, while making profound philosophical claims that are still influential today. The Denial of Death essentially makes two points: 1.    Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don’t sit around and worry about their career. Cats don’t think about their past mistakes or wonder what would have happened if they’d done something differently. Monkeys don’t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don’t sit around wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins. As humans, we’re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations, to contemplate both the past and the future, to imagine other realities or situations where things might be different. And it’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at some point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because we’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it. This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do. 2.   Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two “selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps, snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or how we see ourselves. Becker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its inevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us. Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our influence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self. That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist. Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not more so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die. Religion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation are the result of people’s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and mass murder occur when one group of people’s immortality projects rub up against another group’s. Centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of millions have been justified as the defense of one group’s immortality project against another’s. But, when our immortality projects fail, when the meaning is lost, when the prospect of our conceptual self outliving our physical self no longer seems possible or likely, death terror—that horrible, depressing anxiety—creeps back into our mind. Trauma can cause this, as can shame and social ridicule. As can, as Becker points out, mental illness. If you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values. They are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our values fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in essence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the impermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to get caught up in various forms of entitlement. Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self across the world, people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the bitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can. Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views. The Sunny Side of Death I step from rock to rock, climbing steadily, leg muscles stretching and aching. In that trancelike state that comes from slow, repetitive physical exertion, I’m nearing the top. The sky gets wide and deep. I’m alone now. My friends are far below me, taking pictures of the ocean. Finally, I climb over a small boulder and the view opens up. I can see from here to the infinite horizon. It feels as though I’m staring at the edge of the earth, where water meets the sky, blue on blue. The wind screams across my skin. I look up. It’s bright. It’s beautiful. I’m at South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, once thought to be the southern tip of Africa and the southernmost point in the world. It’s a tumultuous place, a place full of storms and treacherous waters. A place that’s seen centuries of trade and commerce and human endeavor. A place, ironically, of lost hopes. There is a saying in Portuguese: Ele dobra o Cabo da Boa Esperança. It means, “He’s rounding the Cape of Good Hope.” Ironically, it means that the person’s life is in its final phase, that he’s incapable of accomplishing anything more. I step across the rocks toward the blue, allowing its vastness to engulf my field of vision. I’m sweating yet cold. Excited yet nervous. Is this it? The wind is slapping my ears. I hear nothing, but I see the edge: where the rock meets oblivion. I stop and stand for a moment, several yards away. I can see the ocean below, lapping and frothing against cliffs stretching out for miles to either side. The tides are furious against the impenetrable walls. Straight ahead, it’s a sheer drop of at least fifty yards to the water below. To my right, tourists are dotted across the landscape below, snapping photos and aggregating themselves into antlike formations. To my left is Asia. In front of me is the sky and behind is me is everything I’ve ever hoped for and brought with me. What if this is it? What if this is all there is? I look around. I’m alone. I take my first step toward the edge of the cliff. The human body seems to come equipped with a natural radar for death-inducing situations. For example, the moment you get within about ten feet of a cliff edge, minus guardrail, a certain tension digs into your body. Your back stiffens. Your skin ripples. Your eyes become hyperfocused on every detail of your environment. Your feet feel as though they’re made of rock. It’s as if there were a big, invisible magnet gently pulling your body back to safety. But I fight the magnet. I drag the feet made of rock closer to the edge. At five feet away, your mind joins the party. You can now see not only the edge of the cliff, but down the cliff face itself, which induces all sorts of unwanted visualizations of tripping and falling and tumbling to a splashy death. It’s really fucking far, your mind reminds you. Like, really fucking far. Dude, what are you doing? Stop moving. Stop it. I tell my mind to shut up, and keep inching forward. At three feet, your body goes into full-scale red alert. You are now within an errant shoelace-trip of your life ending. It feels as though a hefty gust of wind could send you sailing off into that blue-bisected eternity. Your legs shake. As do your hands. As does your voice, in case you need to remind yourself you’re not about to plummet to your death. The three-foot distance is most people’s absolute limit. It’s just close enough to lean forward and catch a glimpse of the bottom, but still far enough to feel as though you’re not at any real risk of killing yourself. Standing that close to the edge of a cliff, even one as beautiful and mesmerizing as the Cape of Good Hope, induces a heady sense of vertigo, and threatens to regurgitate any recent meal. Is this it? Is this all there is? Do I already know everything I will ever know? I take another microstep, then another. Two feet now. My forward leg vibrates as I put the weight of my body on it. I shuffle on. Against the magnet. Against my mind. Against all my better instincts for survival. One foot now. I’m now looking straight down the cliff face. I feel a sudden urge to cry. My body instinctively crouches, protecting itself against something imagined and inexplicable. The wind comes in hailstorms. The thoughts come in right hooks. At one foot you feel like you’re floating. Anything but looking straight down feels as though you’re part of the sky itself. You actually kind of expect to fall at this point. I crouch there for a moment, catching my breath, collecting my thoughts. I force myself to stare down at the water hitting the rocks below me. Then I look again to my right, at the little ants milling about the signage below me, snapping photos, chasing tour buses, on the off chance that somebody somehow sees me. This desire for attention is wholly irrational. But so is all of this. It’s impossible to make me out up here, of course. And even if it weren’t, there’s nothing that those distant people could say or do. All I hear is the wind. Is this it? My body shudders, the fear becoming euphoric and blinding. I focus my mind and clear my thoughts in a kind of meditation. Nothing makes you present and mindful like being mere inches away from your own death. I straighten up and look out again, and find myself smiling. I remind myself that it’s all right to die. This willing and even exuberant interfacing with one’s own mortality has ancient roots. The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome implored people to keep death in mind at all times, in order to appreciate life more and remain humble in the face of its adversities. In various forms of Buddhism, the practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for death while still remaining alive. Dissolving one’s ego into an expansive nothingness—achieving the enlightened state of nirvana—is seen as a trial run of letting oneself cross to the other side. Even Mark Twain, that hairy goofball who came in and left on Halley’s Comet, said, “The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” Back on the cliff, I bend down, slightly leaning back. I put my hands on the ground behind me and gently lower myself onto my butt. I then gradually slide one leg over the edge of the cliff. There’s a small rock jutting out of the cliff side. I rest my foot on it. Then I slide my other foot off the edge and put it on the same small rock. I sit there a moment, leaning back on my palms, wind ruffling my hair. The anxiety is bearable now, as long as I stay focused on the horizon. Then I sit up straight and look down the cliff again. Fear shoots back up through my spine, electrifying my limbs and laser-focusing my mind on the exact coordinates of every inch of my body. The fear is stifling at times. But each time it stifles me, I empty my thoughts, focus my attention on the bottom of the cliff below me, force myself to gaze at my potential doom, and then to simply acknowledge its existence. I was now sitting on the edge of the world, at the southern-most tip of hope, the gateway to the east. The feeling was exhilarating. I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my body. Being so still, so conscious, never felt so thrilling. I listen to the wind and watch the ocean and look out upon the ends of the earth—and then I laugh with the light, all that it touches being good. Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy? How will the world be different and better when you’re gone? What mark will you have made? What influence will you have caused? They say that a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa can cause a hurricane in Florida; well, what hurricanes will you leave in your wake? As Becker pointed out, this is arguably the only truly important question in our life. Yet we avoid thinking about it. One, because it’s hard. Two, because it’s scary. Three, because we have no fucking clue what we’re doing. And when we avoid this question, we let trivial and hateful values hijack our brains and take control of our desires and ambitions. Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty. And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions. It is the correct answer to all of the questions we should ask but never do. The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself, that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you. This is the basic root of all happiness. Whether you’re listening to Aristotle or the psychologists at Harvard or Jesus Christ or the goddamn Beatles, they all say that happiness comes from the same thing: caring about something greater than yourself, believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production. This feeling is what people go to church for; it’s what they fight in wars for; it’s what they raise families and save pensions and build bridges and invent cell phones for: this fleeting sense of being part of something greater and more unknowable than themselves. And entitlement strips this away from us. The gravity of entitlement sucks all attention inward, toward ourselves, causing us to feel as though we are at the center of all of the problems in the universe, that we are the one suffering all of the injustices, that we are the one who deserves greatness over all others. As alluring as it is, entitlement isolates us. Our curiosity and excitement for the world turns in upon itself and reflects our own biases and projections onto every person we meet and every event we experience. This feels sexy and enticing and may feel good for a while and sells a lot of tickets, but it’s spiritual poison. It’s these dynamics that plague us now. We are so materially well off, yet so psychologically tormented in so many low-level and shallow ways. People relinquish all responsibility, demanding that society cater to their feelings and sensibilities. People hold on to arbitrary certainties and try to enforce them on others, often violently, in the name of some made-up righteous cause. People, high on a sense of false superiority, fall into inaction and lethargy for fear of trying something worthwhile and failing at it. The pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something, a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it. People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience. And they do this not because they actually think they are greater than everybody else; they do it because they feel that they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary. Our culture today confuses great attention and great success, assuming them to be the same thing. But they are not. You are great. Already. Whether you realize it or not. Whether anybody else realizes it or not. And it’s not because you launched an iPhone app, or finished school a year early, or bought yourself a sweet-ass boat. These things do not define greatness. You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to. This mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already makes you loved. Even if you don’t realize it. Even if you’re sleeping in a gutter and starving. You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. You may not feel this. But go stand on a cliff sometime, and maybe you will. Bukowski once wrote, “We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.” Looking back on that night, out by that lake, when I watched my friend Josh’s body getting fished out of the lake by paramedics. I remember staring into the black Texas night and watching my ego slowly dissolve into it. Josh’s death taught me much more than I initially realized. Yes, it helped me to seize the day, to take responsibility for my choices, and to pursue my dreams with less shame and inhibition. But these were side effects of a deeper, more primary lesson. And the primary lesson was this: there is nothing to be afraid of. Ever. And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years—whether it be through meditation, through reading philosophy, or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in South Africa—is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind. This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death. The more I peer into the darkness, the brighter life gets, the quieter the world becomes, and the less unconscious resistance I feel to, well, anything. I sit there on the Cape for a few minutes, taking in everything. When I finally decide to get up, I put my hands behind me and scoot back. Then, slowly, I stand. I check the ground around me—making sure there’s no errant rock ready to sabotage me. Having recognized that I am safe, I begin to walk back to reality—five feet, ten feet—my body restoring itself with each step. My feet become lighter. I let life’s magnet draw me in. As I step back over some rocks, back to the main path, I look up to see a man staring at me. I stop and make eye contact with him. “Um. I saw you sitting on the edge over there,” he says. His accent is Australian. The word “there” rolls out of his mouth awkwardly. He points toward Antarctica. “Yeah. The view is gorgeous, isn’t it?” I am smiling. He is not. He has a serious look on his face. I brush my hands off on my shorts, my body still buzzing from my surrender. There’s an awkward silence. The Aussie stands for a moment, perplexed, still looking at me, clearly thinking of what to say next. After a moment, he carefully pieces the words together. “Is everything okay? How are you feeling?” I pause for a moment, still smiling. “Alive. Very alive.” His skepticism breaks and reveals a smile in its place. He gives a slight nod and heads down the trail. I stand above, taking in the view, waiting for my friends to arrive on the peak.    ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This book began as a big, messy thing and required more than just my own hands to chisel something comprehensible out of it. First and foremost, thank you to my brilliant and beautiful wife, Fernanda, who never hesitates to say no to me when I need to hear it most. Not only do you make me a better person, but your unconditional love and constant feedback during the writing process were indispensable. To my parents, for putting up with my shit all these years and continuing to love me anyway. In many ways, I don’t feel as though I fully became an adult until I understood many of the concepts in this book. In that sense, it’s been a joy to get to know you as an adult these past few years. And to my brother as well: I never doubt the existence of mutual love and respect between us, even if I sometimes get butt-hurt that you don’t text me back. To Philip Kemper and Drew Birnie—two big brains that conspire to make my brain appear much larger than it actually is. Your hard work and brilliance continue to floor me. To Michael Covell, for being my intellectual stress test, especially when it comes to understanding psychological research, and for always challenging me on my assumptions. To my editor, Luke Dempsey, for mercilessly tightening the screws on my writing, and for possibly having an even fouler mouth than I do. To my agent, Mollie Glick, for helping me define the vision for the book and pushing it much farther into the world than I ever expected to see it go. To Taylor Pearson, Dan Andrews, and Jodi Ettenburg, for their support during this process; you three kept me both accountable and sane, which are the only two things every writer needs. And finally, to the millions of people who, for whatever reason, decided to read a potty-mouthed asshole from Boston writing about life on his blog. The flood of emails I’ve received from those of you willing to open up the most intimate corners of your life to me, a complete stranger, both humbles me and inspires me. At this point in my life, I’ve spent thousands of hours reading and studying these subjects. But you all continue to be my true education. Thank you.
