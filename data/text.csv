introduction

my	story

o

n	the	final	day	of	my	sophomore	year	of	high	school	i	was	hit	in
the	face	with	a	baseball	bat	as	my	classmate	took	a	full	swing	the
bat	slipped	out	of	his	hands	and	came	flying	toward	me	before	striking
me	directly	between	the	eyes	i	have	no	memory	of	the	moment	of
impact

the	bat	smashed	into	my	face	with	such	force	that	it	crushed	my
nose	into	a	distorted	ushape	the	collision	sent	the	soft	tissue	of	my
brain	slamming	into	the	inside	of	my	skull	immediately	a	wave	of
swelling	surged	throughout	my	head	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	i	had	a
broken	nose	multiple	skull	fractures	and	two	shattered	eye	sockets

when	i	opened	my	eyes	i	saw	people	staring	at	me	and	running
over	to	help	i	looked	down	and	noticed	spots	of	red	on	my	clothes
one	of	my	classmates	took	the	shirt	off	his	back	and	handed	it	to	me	i
used	it	to	plug	the	stream	of	blood	rushing	from	my	broken	nose
shocked	and	confused	i	was	unaware	of	how	seriously	i	had	been
injured

my	teacher	looped	his	arm	around	my	shoulder	and	we	began	the
long	walk	to	the	nurses	office	across	the	field	down	the	hill	and	back
into	school	random	hands	touched	my	sides	holding	me	upright	we
took	our	time	and	walked	slowly	nobody	realized	that	every	minute
mattered

when	we	arrived	at	the	nurses	office	she	asked	me	a	series	of

questions

what	year	is	it

1998	i	answered	it	was	actually	2002

who	is	the	president	of	the	united	states

bill	clinton	i	said	the	correct	answer	was	george	w	bush

what	is	your	moms	name

uh	um	i	stalled	ten	seconds	passed

patti	i	said	casually	ignoring	the	fact	that	it	had	taken	me	ten

seconds	to	remember	my	own	mothers	name

that	is	the	last	question	i	remember	my	body	was	unable	to	handle

the	rapid	swelling	in	my	brain	and	i	lost	consciousness	before	the
ambulance	arrived	minutes	later	i	was	carried	out	of	school	and	taken
to	the	local	hospital

shortly	after	arriving	my	body	began	shutting	down	i	struggled

with	basic	functions	like	swallowing	and	breathing	i	had	my	first
seizure	of	the	day	then	i	stopped	breathing	entirely	as	the	doctors
hurried	to	supply	me	with	oxygen	they	also	decided	the	local	hospital
was	unequipped	to	handle	the	situation	and	ordered	a	helicopter	to	fly
me	to	a	larger	hospital	in	cincinnati

i	was	rolled	out	of	the	emergency	room	doors	and	toward	the

helipad	across	the	street	the	stretcher	rattled	on	a	bumpy	sidewalk	as
one	nurse	pushed	me	along	while	another	pumped	each	breath	into	me
by	hand	my	mother	who	had	arrived	at	the	hospital	a	few	moments
before	climbed	into	the	helicopter	beside	me	i	remained	unconscious
and	unable	to	breathe	on	my	own	as	she	held	my	hand	during	the
flight

while	my	mother	rode	with	me	in	the	helicopter	my	father	went
home	to	check	on	my	brother	and	sister	and	break	the	news	to	them
he	choked	back	tears	as	he	explained	to	my	sister	that	he	would	miss
her	eighthgrade	graduation	ceremony	that	night	after	passing	my
siblings	off	to	family	and	friends	he	drove	to	cincinnati	to	meet	my
mother

when	my	mom	and	i	landed	on	the	roof	of	the	hospital	a	team	of

nearly	twenty	doctors	and	nurses	sprinted	onto	the	helipad	and
wheeled	me	into	the	trauma	unit	by	this	time	the	swelling	in	my	brain
had	become	so	severe	that	i	was	having	repeated	posttraumatic
seizures	my	broken	bones	needed	to	be	fixed	but	i	was	in	no
condition	to	undergo	surgery	after	yet	another	seizuremy	third	of
the	dayi	was	put	into	a	medically	induced	coma	and	placed	on	a
ventilator

my	parents	were	no	strangers	to	this	hospital	ten	years	earlier
they	had	entered	the	same	building	on	the	ground	floor	after	my	sister

was	diagnosed	with	leukemia	at	age	three	i	was	five	at	the	time	my
brother	was	just	six	months	old	after	two	and	a	half	years	of
chemotherapy	treatments	spinal	taps	and	bone	marrow	biopsies	my
little	sister	finally	walked	out	of	the	hospital	happy	healthy	and
cancer	free	and	now	after	ten	years	of	normal	life	my	parents	found
themselves	back	in	the	same	place	with	a	different	child

while	i	slipped	into	a	coma	the	hospital	sent	a	priest	and	a	social

worker	to	comfort	my	parents	it	was	the	same	priest	who	had	met
with	them	a	decade	earlier	on	the	evening	they	found	out	my	sister	had
cancer

as	day	faded	into	night	a	series	of	machines	kept	me	alive	my
parents	slept	restlessly	on	a	hospital	mattressone	moment	they
would	collapse	from	fatigue	the	next	they	would	be	wide	awake	with
worry	my	mother	would	tell	me	later	it	was	one	of	the	worst	nights
i have	ever	had

my	recovery

mercifully	by	the	next	morning	my	breathing	had	rebounded	to	the
point	where	the	doctors	felt	comfortable	releasing	me	from	the	coma
when	i	finally	regained	consciousness	i	discovered	that	i	had	lost	my
ability	to	smell	as	a	test	a	nurse	asked	me	to	blow	my	nose	and	sniff
an	apple	juice	box	my	sense	of	smell	returned	butto	everyone is
surprisethe	act	of	blowing	my	nose	forced	air	through	the	fractures
in	my	eye	socket	and	pushed	my	left	eye	outward	my	eyeball	bulged
out	of	the	socket	held	precariously	in	place	by	my	eyelid	and	the	optic
nerve	attaching	my	eye	to	my	brain

the	ophthalmologist	said	my	eye	would	gradually	slide	back	into
place	as	the	air	seeped	out	but	it	was	hard	to	tell	how	long	this	would
take	i	was	scheduled	for	surgery	one	week	later	which	would	allow	me
some	additional	time	to	heal	i	looked	like	i	had	been	on	the	wrong	end
of	a	boxing	match	but	i	was	cleared	to	leave	the	hospital	i	returned
home	with	a	broken	nose	half	a	dozen	facial	fractures	and	a	bulging
left	eye

the	following	months	were	hard	it	felt	like	everything	in	my	life
was	on	pause	i	had	double	vision	for	weeks	i	literally	could not	see
straight	it	took	more	than	a	month	but	my	eyeball	did	eventually
return	to	its	normal	location	between	the	seizures	and	my	vision

problems	it	was	eight	months	before	i	could	drive	a	car	again	at
physical	therapy	i	practiced	basic	motor	patterns	like	walking	in	a
straight	line	i	was	determined	not	to	let	my	injury	get	me	down	but
there	were	more	than	a	few	moments	when	i	felt	depressed	and
overwhelmed

i	became	painfully	aware	of	how	far	i	had	to	go	when	i	returned	to
the	baseball	field	one	year	later	baseball	had	always	been	a	major	part
of	my	life	my	dad	had	played	minor	league	baseball	for	the	st	louis
cardinals	and	i	had	a	dream	of	playing	professionally	too	after
months	of	rehabilitation	what	i	wanted	more	than	anything	was	to	get
back	on	the	field

but	my	return	to	baseball	was	not	smooth	when	the	season	rolled
around	i	was	the	only	junior	to	be	cut	from	the	varsity	baseball	team	i
was	sent	down	to	play	with	the	sophomores	on	junior	varsity	i	had
been	playing	since	age	four	and	for	someone	who	had	spent	so	much
time	and	effort	on	the	sport	getting	cut	was	humiliating	i	vividly
remember	the	day	it	happened	i	sat	in	my	car	and	cried	as	i	flipped
through	the	radio	desperately	searching	for	a	song	that	would	make
me	feel	better

after	a	year	of	selfdoubt	i	managed	to	make	the	varsity	team	as	a

senior	but	i	rarely	made	it	on	the	field	in	total	i	played	eleven
innings	of	high	school	varsity	baseball	barely	more	than	a	single	game

despite	my	lackluster	high	school	career	i	still	believed	i	could

become	a	great	player	and	i	knew	that	if	things	were	going	to
improve	i	was	the	one	responsible	for	making	it	happen	the	turning
point	came	two	years	after	my	injury	when	i	began	college	at	denison
university	it	was	a	new	beginning	and	it	was	the	place	where	i	would
discover	the	surprising	power	of	small	habits	for	the	first	time

how	i	learned	about	habits

attending	denison	was	one	of	the	best	decisions	of	my	life	i	earned	a
spot	on	the	baseball	team	and	although	i	was	at	the	bottom	of	the
roster	as	a	freshman	i	was	thrilled	despite	the	chaos	of	my	high
school	years	i	had	managed	to	become	a	college	athlete

i	was not	going	to	be	starting	on	the	baseball	team	anytime	soon	so	i
focused	on	getting	my	life	in	order	while	my	peers	stayed	up	late	and

played	video	games	i	built	good	sleep	habits	and	went	to	bed	early
each	night	in	the	messy	world	of	a	college	dorm	i	made	a	point	to
keep	my	room	neat	and	tidy	these	improvements	were	minor	but
they	gave	me	a	sense	of	control	over	my	life	i	started	to	feel	confident
again	and	this	growing	belief	in	myself	rippled	into	the	classroom	as	i
improved	my	study	habits	and	managed	to	earn	straight	as	during	my
first	year

a	habit	is	a	routine	or	behavior	that	is	performed	regularlyand	in

many	cases	automatically	as	each	semester	passed	i	accumulated
small	but	consistent	habits	that	ultimately	led	to	results	that	were
unimaginable	to	me	when	i	started	for	example	for	the	first	time	in
my	life	i	made	it	a	habit	to	lift	weights	multiple	times	per	week	and	in
the	years	that	followed	my	sixfootfourinch	frame	bulked	up	from	a
featherweight	170	to	a	lean	200	pounds

when	my	sophomore	season	arrived	i	earned	a	starting	role	on	the

pitching	staff	by	my	junior	year	i	was	voted	team	captain	and	at	the
end	of	the	season	i	was	selected	for	the	allconference	team	but	it	was
not	until	my	senior	season	that	my	sleep	habits	study	habits	and
strengthtraining	habits	really	began	to	pay	off

six	years	after	i	had	been	hit	in	the	face	with	a	baseball	bat	flown	to

the	hospital	and	placed	into	a	coma	i	was	selected	as	the	top	male
athlete	at	denison	university	and	named	to	the	espn	academic	all
america	teaman	honor	given	to	just	thirtythree	players	across	the
country	by	the	time	i	graduated	i	was	listed	in	the	school	record
books	in	eight	different	categories	that	same	year	i	was	awarded	the
universitys	highest	academic	honor	the	presidents	medal

i	hope	you will	forgive	me	if	this	sounds	boastful	to	be	honest	there

was	nothing	legendary	or	historic	about	my	athletic	career	i	never
ended	up	playing	professionally	however	looking	back	on	those
years	i	believe	i	accomplished	something	just	as	rare	i	fulfilled	my
potential	and	i	believe	the	concepts	in	this	book	can	help	you	fulfill
your	potential	as	well

we	all	face	challenges	in	life	this	injury	was	one	of	mine	and	the
experience	taught	me	a	critical	lesson	changes	that	seem	small	and
unimportant	at	first	will	compound	into	remarkable	results	if	you are
willing	to	stick	with	them	for	years	we	all	deal	with	setbacks	but	in	the
long	run	the	quality	of	our	lives	often	depends	on	the	quality	of	our

habits	with	the	same	habits	you will	end	up	with	the	same	results	but
with	better	habits	anything	is	possible

maybe	there	are	people	who	can	achieve	incredible	success

overnight	i	do not	know	any	of	them	and	i am	certainly	not	one	of	them
there	was not	one	defining	moment	on	my	journey	from	medically
induced	coma	to	academic	allamerican	there	were	many	it	was	a
gradual	evolution	a	long	series	of	small	wins	and	tiny	breakthroughs
the	only	way	i	made	progressthe	only	choice	i	hadwas	to	start
small	and	i	employed	this	same	strategy	a	few	years	later	when	i
started	my	own	business	and	began	working	on	this	book

how	and	why	i	wrote	this	book

in	november	2012	i	began	publishing	articles	at	jamesclearcom	for
years	i	had	been	keeping	notes	about	my	personal	experiments	with
habits	and	i	was	finally	ready	to	share	some	of	them	publicly	i	began
by	publishing	a	new	article	every	monday	and	thursday	within	a	few
months	this	simple	writing	habit	led	to	my	first	one	thousand	email
subscribers	and	by	the	end	of	2013	that	number	had	grown	to	more
than	thirty	thousand	people

in	2014	my	email	list	expanded	to	over	one	hundred	thousand
subscribers	which	made	it	one	of	the	fastestgrowing	newsletters	on
the	internet	i	had	felt	like	an	impostor	when	i	began	writing	two	years
earlier	but	now	i	was	becoming	known	as	an	expert	on	habitsa	new
label	that	excited	me	but	also	felt	uncomfortable	i	had	never
considered	myself	a	master	of	the	topic	but	rather	someone	who	was
experimenting	alongside	my	readers

in	2015	i	reached	two	hundred	thousand	email	subscribers	and
signed	a	book	deal	with	penguin	random	house	to	begin	writing	the
book	you	are	reading	now	as	my	audience	grew	so	did	my	business
opportunities	i	was	increasingly	asked	to	speak	at	top	companies
about	the	science	of	habit	formation	behavior	change	and	continuous
improvement	i	found	myself	delivering	keynote	speeches	at
conferences	in	the	united	states	and	europe

in	2016	my	articles	began	to	appear	regularly	in	major	publications
like	time	entrepreneur	and	forbes	incredibly	my	writing	was	read
by	over	eight	million	people	that	year	coaches	in	the	nfl	nba	and
mlb	began	reading	my	work	and	sharing	it	with	their	teams

at	the	start	of	2017	i	launched	the	habits	academy	which	became

the	premier	training	platform	for	organizations	and	individuals
interested	in	building	better	habits	in	life	and	work	fortune	500
companies	and	growing	startups	began	to	enroll	their	leaders	and
train	their	staff	in	total	over	ten	thousand	leaders	managers
coaches	and	teachers	have	graduated	from	the	habits	academy	and
my	work	with	them	has	taught	me	an	incredible	amount	about	what	it
takes	to	make	habits	work	in	the	real	world

as	i	put	the	finishing	touches	on	this	book	in	2018	jamesclearcom

is	receiving	millions	of	visitors	per	month	and	nearly	five	hundred
thousand	people	subscribe	to	my	weekly	email	newslettera	number
that	is	so	far	beyond	my	expectations	when	i	began	that	i am	not	even
sure	what	to	think	of	it

how	this	book	will	benefit	you

the	entrepreneur	and	investor	naval	ravikant	has	said	to	write	a
great	book	you	must	first	become	the	book	i	originally	learned	about
the	ideas	mentioned	here	because	i	had	to	live	them	i	had	to	rely	on
small	habits	to	rebound	from	my	injury	to	get	stronger	in	the	gym	to
perform	at	a	high	level	on	the	field	to	become	a	writer	to	build	a
successful	business	and	simply	to	develop	into	a	responsible	adult
small	habits	helped	me	fulfill	my	potential	and	since	you	picked	up
this	book	i am	guessing	you would	like	to	fulfill	yours	as	well

in	the	pages	that	follow	i	will	share	a	stepbystep	plan	for	building

better	habitsnot	for	days	or	weeks	but	for	a	lifetime	while	science
supports	everything	i have	written	this	book	is	not	an	academic	research
paper	its	an	operating	manual	you will	find	wisdom	and	practical
advice	front	and	center	as	i	explain	the	science	of	how	to	create	and
change	your	habits	in	a	way	that	is	easy	to	understand	and	apply

the	fields	i	draw	onbiology	neuroscience	philosophy

psychology	and	morehave	been	around	for	many	years	what	i	offer
you	is	a	synthesis	of	the	best	ideas	smart	people	figured	out	a	long	time
ago	as	well	as	the	most	compelling	discoveries	scientists	have	made
recently	my	contribution	i	hope	is	to	find	the	ideas	that	matter	most
and	connect	them	in	a	way	that	is	highly	actionable	anything	wise	in
these	pages	you	should	credit	to	the	many	experts	who	preceded	me
anything	foolish	assume	it	is	my	error

the	backbone	of	this	book	is	my	fourstep	model	of	habitscue
craving	response	and	rewardand	the	four	laws	of	behavior	change
that	evolve	out	of	these	steps	readers	with	a	psychology	background
may	recognize	some	of	these	terms	from	operant	conditioning	which
was	first	proposed	as	stimulus	response	reward	by	b	f	skinner	in
the	1930s	and	has	been	popularized	more	recently	as	cue	routine
reward	in	the	power	of	habit	by	charles	duhigg

behavioral	scientists	like	skinner	realized	that	if	you	offered	the
right	reward	or	punishment	you	could	get	people	to	act	in	a	certain
way	but	while	skinners	model	did	an	excellent	job	of	explaining	how
external	stimuli	influenced	our	habits	it	lacked	a	good	explanation	for
how	our	thoughts	feelings	and	beliefs	impact	our	behavior	internal
statesour	moods	and	emotionsmatter	too	in	recent	decades
scientists	have	begun	to	determine	the	connection	between	our
thoughts	feelings	and	behavior	this	research	will	also	be	covered	in
these	pages

in	total	the	framework	i	offer	is	an	integrated	model	of	the

cognitive	and	behavioral	sciences	i	believe	it	is	one	of	the	first	models
of	human	behavior	to	accurately	account	for	both	the	influence	of
external	stimuli	and	internal	emotions	on	our	habits	while	some	of
the	language	may	be	familiar	i	am	confident	that	the	detailsand	the
applications	of	the	four	laws	of	behavior	changewill	offer	a	new
way	to	think	about	your	habits

human	behavior	is	always	changing	situation	to	situation	moment

to	moment	second	to	second	but	this	book	is	about	what	does not
change	its	about	the	fundamentals	of	human	behavior	the	lasting
principles	you	can	rely	on	year	after	year	the	ideas	you	can	build	a
business	around	build	a	family	around	build	a	life	around

there	is	no	one	right	way	to	create	better	habits	but	this	book
describes	the	best	way	i	knowan	approach	that	will	be	effective
regardless	of	where	you	start	or	what	you are	trying	to	change	the
strategies	i	cover	will	be	relevant	to	anyone	looking	for	a	stepbystep
system	for	improvement	whether	your	goals	center	on	health	money
productivity	relationships	or	all	of	the	above	as	long	as	human
behavior	is	involved	this	book	will	be	your	guide

the	surprising	power	of	atomic	habits

t

he	fate	of	british	cycling	changed	one	day	in	2003	the
organization	which	was	the	governing	body	for	professional
cycling	in	great	britain	had	recently	hired	dave	brailsford	as	its	new
performance	director	at	the	time	professional	cyclists	in	great	britain
had	endured	nearly	one	hundred	years	of	mediocrity	since	1908
british	riders	had	won	just	a	single	gold	medal	at	the	olympic	games

refused	to	sell	bikes	to	the	team	because	they	were	afraid	that	it	would
hurt	sales	if	other	professionals	saw	the	brits	using	their	gear

brailsford	had	been	hired	to	put	british	cycling	on	a	new	trajectory

what	made	him	different	from	previous	coaches	was	his	relentless
commitment	to	a	strategy	that	he	referred	to	as	the	aggregation	of
marginal	gains	which	was	the	philosophy	of	searching	for	a	tiny
margin	of	improvement	in	everything	you	do	brailsford	said	the
whole	principle	came	from	the	idea	that	if	you	broke	down	everything
you	could	think	of	that	goes	into	riding	a	bike	and	then	improve	it	by	1
percent	you	will	get	a	significant	increase	when	you	put	them	all
together

brailsford	and	his	coaches	began	by	making	small	adjustments	you

might	expect	from	a	professional	cycling	team	they	redesigned	the
bike	seats	to	make	them	more	comfortable	and	rubbed	alcohol	on	the
tires	for	a	better	grip	they	asked	riders	to	wear	electrically	heated
overshorts	to	maintain	ideal	muscle	temperature	while	riding	and	used

biofeedback	sensors	to	monitor	how	each	athlete	responded	to	a
particular	workout	the	team	tested	various	fabrics	in	a	wind	tunnel
and	had	their	outdoor	riders	switch	to	indoor	racing	suits	which
proved	to	be	lighter	and	more	aerodynamic

but	they	did not	stop	there	brailsford	and	his	team	continued	to	find

1	percent	improvements	in	overlooked	and	unexpected	areas	they
tested	different	types	of	massage	gels	to	see	which	one	led	to	the	fastest
muscle	recovery	they	hired	a	surgeon	to	teach	each	rider	the	best	way
to	wash	their	hands	to	reduce	the	chances	of	catching	a	cold	they
determined	the	type	of	pillow	and	mattress	that	led	to	the	best	nights
sleep	for	each	rider	they	even	painted	the	inside	of	the	team	truck
white	which	helped	them	spot	little	bits	of	dust	that	would	normally
slip	by	unnoticed	but	could	degrade	the	performance	of	the	finely
tuned	bikes

as	these	and	hundreds	of	other	small	improvements	accumulated

the	results	came	faster	than	anyone	could	have	imagined

just	five	years	after	brailsford	took	over	the	british	cycling	team

dominated	the	road	and	track	cycling	events	at	the	2008	olympic
games	in	beijing	where	they	won	an	astounding	60	percent	of	the
gold	medals	available	four	years	later	when	the	olympic	games	came
to	london	the	brits	raised	the	bar	as	they	set	nine	olympic	records
and	seven	world	records

that	same	year	bradley	wiggins	became	the	first	british	cyclist	to

win	the	tour	de	france	the	next	year	his	teammate	chris	froome
won	the	race	and	he	would	go	on	to	win	again	in	2015	2016	and	2017
giving	the	british	team	five	tour	de	france	victories	in	six	years

during	the	tenyear	span	from	2007	to	2017	british	cyclists	won
178	world	championships	and	sixtysix	olympic	or	paralympic	gold
medals	and	captured	five	tour	de	france	victories	in	what	is	widely
regarded	as	the	most	successful	run	in	cycling	history

how	does	this	happen	how	does	a	team	of	previously	ordinary
athletes	transform	into	world	champions	with	tiny	changes	that	at
first	glance	would	seem	to	make	a	modest	difference	at	best	why	do
small	improvements	accumulate	into	such	remarkable	results	and
how	can	you	replicate	this	approach	in	your	own	life

why	small	habits	make	a	big	difference

it	is	so	easy	to	overestimate	the	importance	of	one	defining	moment
and	underestimate	the	value	of	making	small	improvements	on	a	daily
basis	too	often	we	convince	ourselves	that	massive	success	requires
massive	action	whether	it	is	losing	weight	building	a	business
writing	a	book	winning	a	championship	or	achieving	any	other	goal
we	put	pressure	on	ourselves	to	make	some	earthshattering
improvement	that	everyone	will	talk	about

meanwhile	improving	by	1	percent	is not	particularly	notable
sometimes	it	is not	even	noticeablebut	it	can	be	far	more	meaningful
especially	in	the	long	run	the	difference	a	tiny	improvement	can	make
over	time	is	astounding	here is	how	the	math	works	out	if	you	can	get
1	percent	better	each	day	for	one	year	you will	end	up	thirtyseven	times
better	by	the	time	you are	done	conversely	if	you	get	1	percent	worse
each	day	for	one	year	you will	decline	nearly	down	to	zero	what	starts
as	a	small	win	or	a	minor	setback	accumulates	into	something	much
more

1	better	every	day

1	worse	every	day	for	one	year	099365		0003

1	better	every	day	for	one	year	101365		3778

figure	1	the	effects	of	small	habits	compound	over	time	for	example	if
you	can	get	just	1	percent	better	each	day	you will	end	up	with	results	that	are
nearly	37	times	better	after	one	year

habits	are	the	compound	interest	of	selfimprovement	the	same
way	that	money	multiplies	through	compound	interest	the	effects	of
your	habits	multiply	as	you	repeat	them	they	seem	to	make	little
difference	on	any	given	day	and	yet	the	impact	they	deliver	over	the
months	and	years	can	be	enormous	it	is	only	when	looking	back	two
five	or	perhaps	ten	years	later	that	the	value	of	good	habits	and	the
cost	of	bad	ones	becomes	strikingly	apparent

this	can	be	a	difficult	concept	to	appreciate	in	daily	life	we	often
dismiss	small	changes	because	they	do not	seem	to	matter	very	much	in
the	moment	if	you	save	a	little	money	now	you are	still	not	a
millionaire	if	you	go	to	the	gym	three	days	in	a	row	you are	still	out	of
shape	if	you	study	mandarin	for	an	hour	tonight	you	still	have not
learned	the	language	we	make	a	few	changes	but	the	results	never
seem	to	come	quickly	and	so	we	slide	back	into	our	previous	routines

unfortunately	the	slow	pace	of	transformation	also	makes	it	easy	to

let	a	bad	habit	slide	if	you	eat	an	unhealthy	meal	today	the	scale
does not	move	much	if	you	work	late	tonight	and	ignore	your	family

they	will	forgive	you	if	you	procrastinate	and	put	your	project	off	until
tomorrow	there	will	usually	be	time	to	finish	it	later	a	single	decision
is	easy	to	dismiss

but	when	we	repeat	1	percent	errors	day	after	day	by	replicating

poor	decisions	duplicating	tiny	mistakes	and	rationalizing	little
excuses	our	small	choices	compound	into	toxic	results	its	the
accumulation	of	many	misstepsa	1	percent	decline	here	and	there
that	eventually	leads	to	a	problem

the	impact	created	by	a	change	in	your	habits	is	similar	to	the	effect

of	shifting	the	route	of	an	airplane	by	just	a	few	degrees	imagine	you
are	flying	from	los	angeles	to	new	york	city	if	a	pilot	leaving	from
lax	adjusts	the	heading	just	35	degrees	south	you	will	land	in
washington	dc	instead	of	new	york	such	a	small	change	is	barely
noticeable	at	takeoffthe	nose	of	the	airplane	moves	just	a	few	feet
but	when	magnified	across	the	entire	united	states	you	end	up
hundreds	of	miles	apart

similarly	a	slight	change	in	your	daily	habits	can	guide	your	life	to	a
very	different	destination	making	a	choice	that	is	1	percent	better	or	1
percent	worse	seems	insignificant	in	the	moment	but	over	the	span	of
moments	that	make	up	a	lifetime	these	choices	determine	the
difference	between	who	you	are	and	who	you	could	be	success	is	the
product	of	daily	habitsnot	onceinalifetime	transformations

that	said	it	does not	matter	how	successful	or	unsuccessful	you	are
right	now	what	matters	is	whether	your	habits	are	putting	you	on	the
path	toward	success	you	should	be	far	more	concerned	with	your
current	trajectory	than	with	your	current	results	if	you are	a	millionaire
but	you	spend	more	than	you	earn	each	month	then	you are	on	a	bad
trajectory	if	your	spending	habits	do not	change	its	not	going	to	end
well	conversely	if	you are	broke	but	you	save	a	little	bit	every	month
then	you are	on	the	path	toward	financial	freedomeven	if	you are
moving	slower	than	you would	like

your	outcomes	are	a	lagging	measure	of	your	habits	your	net	worth

is	a	lagging	measure	of	your	financial	habits	your	weight	is	a	lagging
measure	of	your	eating	habits	your	knowledge	is	a	lagging	measure	of
your	learning	habits	your	clutter	is	a	lagging	measure	of	your	cleaning
habits	you	get	what	you	repeat

if	you	want	to	predict	where	you will	end	up	in	life	all	you	have	to	do
is	follow	the	curve	of	tiny	gains	or	tiny	losses	and	see	how	your	daily
choices	will	compound	ten	or	twenty	years	down	the	line	are	you
spending	less	than	you	earn	each	month	are	you	making	it	into	the
gym	each	week	are	you	reading	books	and	learning	something	new
each	day	tiny	battles	like	these	are	the	ones	that	will	define	your
future	self

time	magnifies	the	margin	between	success	and	failure	it	will
multiply	whatever	you	feed	it	good	habits	make	time	your	ally	bad
habits	make	time	your	enemy

habits	are	a	doubleedged	sword	bad	habits	can	cut	you	down	just
as	easily	as	good	habits	can	build	you	up	which	is	why	understanding
the	details	is	crucial	you	need	to	know	how	habits	work	and	how	to
design	them	to	your	liking	so	you	can	avoid	the	dangerous	half	of	the
blade

your	habits	can	compound	for	you	or	against	you

positive	compounding

productivity	compounds	accomplishing	one	extra	task	is	a	small	feat	on	any	given	day
but	it	counts	for	a	lot	over	an	entire	career	the	effect	of	automating	an	old	task	or	mastering
a	new	skill	can	be	even	greater	the	more	tasks	you	can	handle	without	thinking	the	more
your	brain	is	free	to	focus	on	other	areas

knowledge	compounds	learning	one	new	idea	will not	make	you	a	genius	but	a
commitment	to	lifelong	learning	can	be	transformative	furthermore	each	book	you	read	not
only	teaches	you	something	new	but	also	opens	up	different	ways	of	thinking	about	old
ideas	as	warren	buffett	says	that is	how	knowledge	works	it	builds	up	like	compound
interest

relationships	compound	people	reflect	your	behavior	back	to	you	the	more	you	help
others	the	more	others	want	to	help	you	being	a	little	bit	nicer	in	each	interaction	can	result
in	a	network	of	broad	and	strong	connections	over	time

negative	compounding

stress	compounds	the	frustration	of	a	traffic	jam	the	weight	of	parenting	responsibilities
the	worry	of	making	ends	meet	the	strain	of	slightly	high	blood	pressure	by	themselves
these	common	causes	of	stress	are	manageable	but	when	they	persist	for	years	little
stresses	compound	into	serious	health	issues

negative	thoughts	compound	the	more	you	think	of	yourself	as	worthless	stupid	or	ugly
the	more	you	condition	yourself	to	interpret	life	that	way	you	get	trapped	in	a	thought	loop
the	same	is	true	for	how	you	think	about	others	once	you	fall	into	the	habit	of	seeing	people
as	angry	unjust	or	selfish	you	see	those	kind	of	people	everywhere

outrage	compounds	riots	protests	and	mass	movements	are	rarely	the	result	of	a	single
event	instead	a	long	series	of	microaggressions	and	daily	aggravations	slowly	multiply	until
one	event	tips	the	scales	and	outrage	spreads	like	wildfire

what	progress	is	really	like

imagine	that	you	have	an	ice	cube	sitting	on	the	table	in	front	of	you
the	room	is	cold	and	you	can	see	your	breath	it	is	currently	twenty
five	degrees	ever	so	slowly	the	room	begins	to	heat	up

twentysix	degrees

twentyseven

twentyeight

the	ice	cube	is	still	sitting	on	the	table	in	front	of	you

twentynine	degrees

thirty

thirtyone

still	nothing	has	happened

then	thirtytwo	degrees	the	ice	begins	to	melt	a	onedegree	shift

seemingly	no	different	from	the	temperature	increases	before	it	has
unlocked	a	huge	change

breakthrough	moments	are	often	the	result	of	many	previous
actions	which	build	up	the	potential	required	to	unleash	a	major
change	this	pattern	shows	up	everywhere	cancer	spends	80	percent
of	its	life	undetectable	then	takes	over	the	body	in	months	bamboo
can	barely	be	seen	for	the	first	five	years	as	it	builds	extensive	root
systems	underground	before	exploding	ninety	feet	into	the	air	within
six	weeks

similarly	habits	often	appear	to	make	no	difference	until	you	cross
a	critical	threshold	and	unlock	a	new	level	of	performance	in	the	early
and	middle	stages	of	any	quest	there	is	often	a	valley	of
disappointment	you	expect	to	make	progress	in	a	linear	fashion	and
its	frustrating	how	ineffective	changes	can	seem	during	the	first	days
weeks	and	even	months	it	does not	feel	like	you	are	going	anywhere
its	a	hallmark	of	any	compounding	process	the	most	powerful
outcomes	are	delayed

this	is	one	of	the	core	reasons	why	it	is	so	hard	to	build	habits	that
last	people	make	a	few	small	changes	fail	to	see	a	tangible	result	and
decide	to	stop	you	think	i have	been	running	every	day	for	a	month	so
why	cannot	i	see	any	change	in	my	body	once	this	kind	of	thinking

takes	over	its	easy	to	let	good	habits	fall	by	the	wayside	but	in	order
to	make	a	meaningful	difference	habits	need	to	persist	long	enough	to
break	through	this	plateauwhat	i	call	the	plateau	of	latent	potential

if	you	find	yourself	struggling	to	build	a	good	habit	or	break	a	bad
one	it	is	not	because	you	have	lost	your	ability	to	improve	it	is	often
because	you	have	not	yet	crossed	the	plateau	of	latent	potential
complaining	about	not	achieving	success	despite	working	hard	is	like
complaining	about	an	ice	cube	not	melting	when	you	heated	it	from
twentyfive	to	thirtyone	degrees	your	work	was	not	wasted	it	is	just
being	stored	all	the	action	happens	at	thirtytwo	degrees

when	you	finally	break	through	the	plateau	of	latent	potential
people	will	call	it	an	overnight	success	the	outside	world	only	sees	the
most	dramatic	event	rather	than	all	that	preceded	it	but	you	know	that
its	the	work	you	did	long	agowhen	it	seemed	that	you	were not
making	any	progressthat	makes	the	jump	today	possible

it	is	the	human	equivalent	of	geological	pressure	two	tectonic
plates	can	grind	against	one	another	for	millions	of	years	the	tension
slowly	building	all	the	while	then	one	day	they	rub	each	other	once
again	in	the	same	fashion	they	have	for	ages	but	this	time	the	tension
is	too	great	an	earthquake	erupts	change	can	take	yearsbefore	it
happens	all	at	once

mastery	requires	patience	the	san	antonio	spurs	one	of	the	most

successful	teams	in	nba	history	have	a	quote	from	social	reformer
jacob	riis	hanging	in	their	locker	room	when	nothing	seems	to	help
i	go	and	look	at	a	stonecutter	hammering	away	at	his	rock	perhaps	a
hundred	times	without	as	much	as	a	crack	showing	in	it	yet	at	the
hundred	and	first	blow	it	will	split	in	two	and	i	know	it	was	not	that
last	blow	that	did	itbut	all	that	had	gone	before

the	plateau	of	latent	potential

figure	2	we	often	expect	progress	to	be	linear	at	the	very	least	we	hope
it	will	come	quickly	in	reality	the	results	of	our	efforts	are	often	delayed	it	is
not	until	months	or	years	later	that	we	realize	the	true	value	of	the	previous
work	we	have	done	this	can	result	in	a	valley	of	disappointment	where
people	feel	discouraged	after	putting	in	weeks	or	months	of	hard	work
without	experiencing	any	results	however	this	work	was	not	wasted	it	was
simply	being	stored	it	is	not	until	much	later	that	the	full	value	of	previous
efforts	is	revealed

all	big	things	come	from	small	beginnings	the	seed	of	every	habit

is	a	single	tiny	decision	but	as	that	decision	is	repeated	a	habit
sprouts	and	grows	stronger	roots	entrench	themselves	and	branches
grow	the	task	of	breaking	a	bad	habit	is	like	uprooting	a	powerful	oak
within	us	and	the	task	of	building	a	good	habit	is	like	cultivating	a
delicate	flower	one	day	at	a	time

but	what	determines	whether	we	stick	with	a	habit	long	enough	to
survive	the	plateau	of	latent	potential	and	break	through	to	the	other
side	what	is	it	that	causes	some	people	to	slide	into	unwanted	habits
and	enables	others	to	enjoy	the	compounding	effects	of	good	ones

forget	about	goals	focus	on	systems	instead

prevailing	wisdom	claims	that	the	best	way	to	achieve	what	we	want	in
lifegetting	into	better	shape	building	a	successful	business	relaxing
more	and	worrying	less	spending	more	time	with	friends	and	family
is	to	set	specific	actionable	goals

for	many	years	this	was	how	i	approached	my	habits	too	each	one

was	a	goal	to	be	reached	i	set	goals	for	the	grades	i	wanted	to	get	in
school	for	the	weights	i	wanted	to	lift	in	the	gym	for	the	profits	i
wanted	to	earn	in	business	i	succeeded	at	a	few	but	i	failed	at	a	lot	of
them	eventually	i	began	to	realize	that	my	results	had	very	little	to	do
with	the	goals	i	set	and	nearly	everything	to	do	with	the	systems	i
followed

what is	the	difference	between	systems	and	goals	its	a	distinction	i

first	learned	from	scott	adams	the	cartoonist	behind	the	dilbert
comic	goals	are	about	the	results	you	want	to	achieve	systems	are
about	the	processes	that	lead	to	those	results

if	you are	a	coach	your	goal	might	be	to	win	a	championship	your
system	is	the	way	you	recruit	players	manage	your	assistant
coaches	and	conduct	practice

if	you are	an	entrepreneur	your	goal	might	be	to	build	a	million
dollar	business	your	system	is	how	you	test	product	ideas	hire
employees	and	run	marketing	campaigns

if	you are	a	musician	your	goal	might	be	to	play	a	new	piece	your
system	is	how	often	you	practice	how	you	break	down	and	tackle
difficult	measures	and	your	method	for	receiving	feedback	from
your	instructor

now	for	the	interesting	question	if	you	completely	ignored	your
goals	and	focused	only	on	your	system	would	you	still	succeed	for
example	if	you	were	a	basketball	coach	and	you	ignored	your	goal	to
win	a	championship	and	focused	only	on	what	your	team	does	at
practice	each	day	would	you	still	get	results

i	think	you	would

the	goal	in	any	sport	is	to	finish	with	the	best	score	but	it	would	be
ridiculous	to	spend	the	whole	game	staring	at	the	scoreboard	the	only
way	to	actually	win	is	to	get	better	each	day	in	the	words	of	threetime
super	bowl	winner	bill	walsh	the	score	takes	care	of	itself	the
same	is	true	for	other	areas	of	life	if	you	want	better	results	then
forget	about	setting	goals	focus	on	your	system	instead

what	do	i	mean	by	this	are	goals	completely	useless	of	course
not	goals	are	good	for	setting	a	direction	but	systems	are	best	for

making	progress	a	handful	of	problems	arise	when	you	spend	too
much	time	thinking	about	your	goals	and	not	enough	time	designing
your	systems

problem	1	winners	and	losers	have	the	same	goals

goal	setting	suffers	from	a	serious	case	of	survivorship	bias	we
concentrate	on	the	people	who	end	up	winningthe	survivorsand
mistakenly	assume	that	ambitious	goals	led	to	their	success	while
overlooking	all	of	the	people	who	had	the	same	objective	but	did not
succeed

every	olympian	wants	to	win	a	gold	medal	every	candidate	wants

to	get	the	job	and	if	successful	and	unsuccessful	people	share	the
same	goals	then	the	goal	cannot	be	what	differentiates	the	winners
from	the	losers	it	was not	the	goal	of	winning	the	tour	de	france	that
propelled	the	british	cyclists	to	the	top	of	the	sport	presumably	they
had	wanted	to	win	the	race	every	year	beforejust	like	every	other
professional	team	the	goal	had	always	been	there	it	was	only	when
they	implemented	a	system	of	continuous	small	improvements	that
they	achieved	a	different	outcome

problem	2	achieving	a	goal	is	only	a	momentary	change

imagine	you	have	a	messy	room	and	you	set	a	goal	to	clean	it	if	you
summon	the	energy	to	tidy	up	then	you	will	have	a	clean	roomfor
now	but	if	you	maintain	the	same	sloppy	packrat	habits	that	led	to	a
messy	room	in	the	first	place	soon	you will	be	looking	at	a	new	pile	of
clutter	and	hoping	for	another	burst	of	motivation	you are	left	chasing
the	same	outcome	because	you	never	changed	the	system	behind	it
you	treated	a	symptom	without	addressing	the	because

achieving	a	goal	only	changes	your	life	for	the	moment	that is	the

counterintuitive	thing	about	improvement	we	think	we	need	to
change	our	results	but	the	results	are	not	the	problem	what	we	really
need	to	change	are	the	systems	that	because	those	results	when	you
solve	problems	at	the	results	level	you	only	solve	them	temporarily	in
order	to	improve	for	good	you	need	to	solve	problems	at	the	systems
level	fix	the	inputs	and	the	outputs	will	fix	themselves

problem	3	goals	restrict	your	happiness

the	implicit	assumption	behind	any	goal	is	this	once	i	reach	my	goal
then	ill	be	happy	the	problem	with	a	goalsfirst	mentality	is	that
you are	continually	putting	happiness	off	until	the	next	milestone	i have
slipped	into	this	trap	so	many	times	i have	lost	count	for	years
happiness	was	always	something	for	my	future	self	to	enjoy	i
promised	myself	that	once	i	gained	twenty	pounds	of	muscle	or	after
my	business	was	featured	in	the	new	york	times	then	i	could	finally
relax

furthermore	goals	create	an	eitheror	conflict	either	you	achieve
your	goal	and	are	successful	or	you	fail	and	you	are	a	disappointment
you	mentally	box	yourself	into	a	narrow	version	of	happiness	this	is
misguided	it	is	unlikely	that	your	actual	path	through	life	will	match
the	exact	journey	you	had	in	mind	when	you	set	out	it	makes	no	sense
to	restrict	your	satisfaction	to	one	scenario	when	there	are	many	paths
to	success

a	systemsfirst	mentality	provides	the	antidote	when	you	fall	in
love	with	the	process	rather	than	the	product	you	do not	have	to	wait	to
give	yourself	permission	to	be	happy	you	can	be	satisfied	anytime
your	system	is	running	and	a	system	can	be	successful	in	many
different	forms	not	just	the	one	you	first	envision

problem	4	goals	are	at	odds	with	longterm	progress

finally	a	goaloriented	mindset	can	create	a	yoyo	effect	many
runners	work	hard	for	months	but	as	soon	as	they	cross	the	finish	line
they	stop	training	the	race	is	no	longer	there	to	motivate	them	when
all	of	your	hard	work	is	focused	on	a	particular	goal	what	is	left	to
push	you	forward	after	you	achieve	it	this	is	why	many	people	find
themselves	reverting	to	their	old	habits	after	accomplishing	a	goal

the	purpose	of	setting	goals	is	to	win	the	game	the	purpose	of
building	systems	is	to	continue	playing	the	game	true	longterm
thinking	is	goalless	thinking	its	not	about	any	single
accomplishment	it	is	about	the	cycle	of	endless	refinement	and
continuous	improvement	ultimately	it	is	your	commitment	to	the
process	that	will	determine	your	progress

a	system	of	atomic	habits

if	you are	having	trouble	changing	your	habits	the	problem	is not	you
the	problem	is	your	system	bad	habits	repeat	themselves	again	and
again	not	because	you	do not	want	to	change	but	because	you	have	the
wrong	system	for	change

you	do	not	rise	to	the	level	of	your	goals	you	fall	to	the	level	of	your

systems

focusing	on	the	overall	system	rather	than	a	single	goal	is	one	of

the	core	themes	of	this	book	it	is	also	one	of	the	deeper	meanings
behind	the	word	atomic	by	now	you have	probably	realized	that	an
atomic	habit	refers	to	a	tiny	change	a	marginal	gain	a	1	percent
improvement	but	atomic	habits	are	not	just	any	old	habits	however
small	they	are	little	habits	that	are	part	of	a	larger	system	just	as
atoms	are	the	building	blocks	of	molecules	atomic	habits	are	the
building	blocks	of	remarkable	results

habits	are	like	the	atoms	of	our	lives	each	one	is	a	fundamental
unit	that	contributes	to	your	overall	improvement	at	first	these	tiny
routines	seem	insignificant	but	soon	they	build	on	each	other	and	fuel
bigger	wins	that	multiply	to	a	degree	that	far	outweighs	the	cost	of
their	initial	investment	they	are	both	small	and	mighty	this	is	the
meaning	of	the	phrase	atomic	habitsa	regular	practice	or	routine
that	is	not	only	small	and	easy	to	do	but	also	the	source	of	incredible
power	a	component	of	the	system	of	compound	growth

chapter	summary

habits	are	the	compound	interest	of	selfimprovement	getting	1
percent	better	every	day	counts	for	a	lot	in	the	longrun

habits	are	a	doubleedged	sword	they	can	work	for	you	or
against	you	which	is	why	understanding	the	details	is	essential

small	changes	often	appear	to	make	no	difference	until	you	cross
a	critical	threshold	the	most	powerful	outcomes	of	any
compounding	process	are	delayed	you	need	to	be	patient

an	atomic	habit	is	a	little	habit	that	is	part	of	a	larger	system	just
as	atoms	are	the	building	blocks	of	molecules	atomic	habits	are
the	building	blocks	of	remarkable	results

if	you	want	better	results	then	forget	about	setting	goals	focus
on	your	system	instead

you	do	not	rise	to	the	level	of	your	goals	you	fall	to	the	level	of
your	systems

how	your	habits	shape	your	identity	and
vice	versa

w

hy	is	it	so	easy	to	repeat	bad	habits	and	so	hard	to	form	good
ones	few	things	can	have	a	more	powerful	impact	on	your	life

than	improving	your	daily	habits	and	yet	it	is	likely	that	this	time	next
year	you will	be	doing	the	same	thing	rather	than	something	better

it	often	feels	difficult	to	keep	good	habits	going	for	more	than	a	few

days	even	with	sincere	effort	and	the	occasional	burst	of	motivation
habits	like	exercise	meditation	journaling	and	cooking	are
reasonable	for	a	day	or	two	and	then	become	a	hassle

however	once	your	habits	are	established	they	seem	to	stick
around	foreverespecially	the	unwanted	ones	despite	our	best
intentions	unhealthy	habits	like	eating	junk	food	watching	too	much
television	procrastinating	and	smoking	can	feel	impossible	to	break

changing	our	habits	is	challenging	for	two	reasons	1	we	try	to

change	the	wrong	thing	and	2	we	try	to	change	our	habits	in	the
wrong	way	in	this	chapter	ill	address	the	first	point	in	the	chapters
that	follow	ill	answer	the	second

our	first	mistake	is	that	we	try	to	change	the	wrong	thing	to

understand	what	i	mean	consider	that	there	are	three	levels	at	which
change	can	occur	you	can	imagine	them	like	the	layers	of	an	onion

three	layers	of	behavior	change

figure	3	there	are	three	layers	of	behavior	change	a	change	in	your
outcomes	a	change	in	your	processes	or	a	change	in	your	identity

the	first	layer	is	changing	your	outcomes	this	level	is
concerned	with	changing	your	results	losing	weight	publishing	a
book	winning	a	championship	most	of	the	goals	you	set	are
associated	with	this	level	of	change

the	second	layer	is	changing	your	process	this	level	is
concerned	with	changing	your	habits	and	systems	implementing	a
new	routine	at	the	gym	decluttering	your	desk	for	better	workflow
developing	a	meditation	practice	most	of	the	habits	you	build	are
associated	with	this	level

the	third	and	deepest	layer	is	changing	your	identity	this

level	is	concerned	with	changing	your	beliefs	your	worldview	your
selfimage	your	judgments	about	yourself	and	others	most	of	the
beliefs	assumptions	and	biases	you	hold	are	associated	with	this	level

outcomes	are	about	what	you	get	processes	are	about	what	you	do

identity	is	about	what	you	believe	when	it	comes	to	building	habits
that	lastwhen	it	comes	to	building	a	system	of	1	percent
improvementsthe	problem	is	not	that	one	level	is	better	or	worse
than	another	all	levels	of	change	are	useful	in	their	own	way	the
problem	is	the	direction	of	change

many	people	begin	the	process	of	changing	their	habits	by	focusing
on	what	they	want	to	achieve	this	leads	us	to	outcomebased	habits
the	alternative	is	to	build	identitybased	habits	with	this	approach
we	start	by	focusing	on	who	we	wish	to	become

outcomebased	habits

identitybased	habits

figure	4	with	outcomebased	habits	the	focus	is	on	what	you	want	to
achieve	with	identitybased	habits	the	focus	is	on	who	you	wish	to
become

imagine	two	people	resisting	a	cigarette	when	offered	a	smoke	the

first	person	says	no	thanks	i am	trying	to	quit	it	sounds	like	a
reasonable	response	but	this	person	still	believes	they	are	a	smoker
who	is	trying	to	be	something	else	they	are	hoping	their	behavior	will
change	while	carrying	around	the	same	beliefs

the	second	person	declines	by	saying	no	thanks	i am	not	a
smoker	its	a	small	difference	but	this	statement	signals	a	shift	in
identity	smoking	was	part	of	their	former	life	not	their	current	one
they	no	longer	identify	as	someone	who	smokes

most	people	do not	even	consider	identity	change	when	they	set	out

to	improve	they	just	think	i	want	to	be	skinny	outcome	and	if	i
stick	to	this	diet	then	ill	be	skinny	process	they	set	goals	and
determine	the	actions	they	should	take	to	achieve	those	goals	without
considering	the	beliefs	that	drive	their	actions	they	never	shift	the

way	they	look	at	themselves	and	they	do not	realize	that	their	old
identity	can	sabotage	their	new	plans	for	change

behind	every	system	of	actions	are	a	system	of	beliefs	the	system	of

a	democracy	is	founded	on	beliefs	like	freedom	majority	rule	and
social	equality	the	system	of	a	dictatorship	has	a	very	different	set	of
beliefs	like	absolute	authority	and	strict	obedience	you	can	imagine
many	ways	to	try	to	get	more	people	to	vote	in	a	democracy	but	such
behavior	change	would	never	get	off	the	ground	in	a	dictatorship
that is	not	the	identity	of	the	system	voting	is	a	behavior	that	is
impossible	under	a	certain	set	of	beliefs

a	similar	pattern	exists	whether	we	are	discussing	individuals
organizations	or	societies	there	are	a	set	of	beliefs	and	assumptions
that	shape	the	system	an	identity	behind	the	habits

behavior	that	is	incongruent	with	the	self	will	not	last	you	may

want	more	money	but	if	your	identity	is	someone	who	consumes
rather	than	creates	then	you will	continue	to	be	pulled	toward	spending
rather	than	earning	you	may	want	better	health	but	if	you	continue	to
prioritize	comfort	over	accomplishment	you will	be	drawn	to	relaxing
rather	than	training	its	hard	to	change	your	habits	if	you	never
change	the	underlying	beliefs	that	led	to	your	past	behavior	you	have
a	new	goal	and	a	new	plan	but	you	have not	changed	who	you	are

the	story	of	brian	clark	an	entrepreneur	from	boulder	colorado
provides	a	good	example	for	as	long	as	i	can	remember	i have	chewed
my	fingernails	clark	told	me	it	started	as	a	nervous	habit	when	i
was	young	and	then	morphed	into	an	undesirable	grooming	ritual
one	day	i	resolved	to	stop	chewing	my	nails	until	they	grew	out	a	bit
through	mindful	willpower	alone	i	managed	to	do	it

then	clark	did	something	surprising

i	asked	my	wife	to	schedule	my	firstever	manicure	he	said	my

thought	was	that	if	i	started	paying	to	maintain	my	nails	i	would not
chew	them	and	it	worked	but	not	for	the	monetary	reason	what
happened	was	the	manicure	made	my	fingers	look	really	nice	for	the
first	time	the	manicurist	even	said	thatother	than	the	chewingi
had	really	healthy	attractive	nails	suddenly	i	was	proud	of	my
fingernails	and	even	though	that is	something	i	had	never	aspired	to	it
made	all	the	difference	i have	never	chewed	my	nails	since	not	even	a

single	close	call	and	its	because	i	now	take	pride	in	properly	caring
for	them

the	ultimate	form	of	intrinsic	motivation	is	when	a	habit	becomes
part	of	your	identity	its	one	thing	to	say	i am	the	type	of	person	who
wants	this	its	something	very	different	to	say	i am	the	type	of	person
who	is	this

the	more	pride	you	have	in	a	particular	aspect	of	your	identity	the
more	motivated	you	will	be	to	maintain	the	habits	associated	with	it	if
you are	proud	of	how	your	hair	looks	you will	develop	all	sorts	of	habits	to
care	for	and	maintain	it	if	you are	proud	of	the	size	of	your	biceps
you will	make	sure	you	never	skip	an	upperbody	workout	if	you are
proud	of	the	scarves	you	knit	you will	be	more	likely	to	spend	hours
knitting	each	week	once	your	pride	gets	involved	you will	fight	tooth
and	nail	to	maintain	your	habits

true	behavior	change	is	identity	change	you	might	start	a	habit
because	of	motivation	but	the	only	reason	you will	stick	with	one	is	that
it	becomes	part	of	your	identity	anyone	can	convince	themselves	to
visit	the	gym	or	eat	healthy	once	or	twice	but	if	you	do not	shift	the
belief	behind	the	behavior	then	it	is	hard	to	stick	with	longterm
changes	improvements	are	only	temporary	until	they	become	part	of
who	you	are

the	goal	is	not	to	read	a	book	the	goal	is	to	become	a	reader

the	goal	is	not	to	run	a	marathon	the	goal	is	to	become	a	runner

the	goal	is	not	to	learn	an	instrument	the	goal	is	to	become	a
musician

your	behaviors	are	usually	a	reflection	of	your	identity	what	you	do

is	an	indication	of	the	type	of	person	you	believe	that	you	areeither
consciously	or	nonconsciously	research	has	shown	that	once	a
person	believes	in	a	particular	aspect	of	their	identity	they	are	more
likely	to	act	in	alignment	with	that	belief	for	example	people	who
identified	as	being	a	voter	were	more	likely	to	vote	than	those	who
simply	claimed	voting	was	an	action	they	wanted	to	perform
similarly	the	person	who	incorporates	exercise	into	their	identity
does not	have	to	convince	themselves	to	train	doing	the	right	thing	is
easy	after	all	when	your	behavior	and	your	identity	are	fully	aligned

you	are	no	longer	pursuing	behavior	change	you	are	simply	acting	like
the	type	of	person	you	already	believe	yourself	to	be

like	all	aspects	of	habit	formation	this	too	is	a	doubleedged
sword	when	working	for	you	identity	change	can	be	a	powerful	force
for	selfimprovement	when	working	against	you	though	identity
change	can	be	a	curse	once	you	have	adopted	an	identity	it	can	be
easy	to	let	your	allegiance	to	it	impact	your	ability	to	change	many
people	walk	through	life	in	a	cognitive	slumber	blindly	following	the
norms	attached	to	their	identity

i am	terrible	with	directions

i am	not	a	morning	person

i am	bad	at	remembering	peoples	names

i am	always	late

i am	not	good	with	technology

i am	horrible	at	math

			and	a	thousand	other	variations

when	you	have	repeated	a	story	to	yourself	for	years	it	is	easy	to
slide	into	these	mental	grooves	and	accept	them	as	a	fact	in	time	you
begin	to	resist	certain	actions	because	that is	not	who	i	am	there	is
internal	pressure	to	maintain	your	selfimage	and	behave	in	a	way	that
is	consistent	with	your	beliefs	you	find	whatever	way	you	can	to	avoid
contradicting	yourself

the	more	deeply	a	thought	or	action	is	tied	to	your	identity	the
more	difficult	it	is	to	change	it	it	can	feel	comfortable	to	believe	what
your	culture	believes	group	identity	or	to	do	what	upholds	your	self
image	personal	identity	even	if	its	wrong	the	biggest	barrier	to
positive	change	at	any	levelindividual	team	societyis	identity
conflict	good	habits	can	make	rational	sense	but	if	they	conflict	with
your	identity	you	will	fail	to	put	them	into	action

on	any	given	day	you	may	struggle	with	your	habits	because	you are
too	busy	or	too	tired	or	too	overwhelmed	or	hundreds	of	other	reasons
over	the	long	run	however	the	real	reason	you	fail	to	stick	with	habits
is	that	your	selfimage	gets	in	the	way	this	is	why	you	cannot	get	too
attached	to	one	version	of	your	identity	progress	requires	unlearning

becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself	requires	you	to	continuously	edit
your	beliefs	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your	identity

this	brings	us	to	an	important	question	if	your	beliefs	and

worldview	play	such	an	important	role	in	your	behavior	where	do	they
come	from	in	the	first	place	how	exactly	is	your	identity	formed
and	how	can	you	emphasize	new	aspects	of	your	identity	that	serve
you	and	gradually	erase	the	pieces	that	hinder	you

the	twostep	process	to	changing	your	identity

your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits	you	are	not	born	with	preset
beliefs	every	belief	including	those	about	yourself	is	learned	and
conditioned	through	experience

more	precisely	your	habits	are	how	you	embody	your	identity
when	you	make	your	bed	each	day	you	embody	the	identity	of	an
organized	person	when	you	write	each	day	you	embody	the	identity
of	a	creative	person	when	you	train	each	day	you	embody	the	identity
of	an	athletic	person

the	more	you	repeat	a	behavior	the	more	you	reinforce	the	identity
associated	with	that	behavior	in	fact	the	word	identity	was	originally
derived	from	the	latin	words	essentitas	which	means	being	and
identidem	which	means	repeatedly	your	identity	is	literally	your
repeated	beingness

whatever	your	identity	is	right	now	you	only	believe	it	because	you
have	proof	of	it	if	you	go	to	church	every	sunday	for	twenty	years	you
have	evidence	that	you	are	religious	if	you	study	biology	for	one	hour
every	night	you	have	evidence	that	you	are	studious	if	you	go	to	the
gym	even	when	its	snowing	you	have	evidence	that	you	are	committed
to	fitness	the	more	evidence	you	have	for	a	belief	the	more	strongly
you	will	believe	it

for	most	of	my	early	life	i	did not	consider	myself	a	writer	if	you
were	to	ask	any	of	my	high	school	teachers	or	college	professors	they
would	tell	you	i	was	an	average	writer	at	best	certainly	not	a	standout
when	i	began	my	writing	career	i	published	a	new	article	every
monday	and	thursday	for	the	first	few	years	as	the	evidence	grew	so
did	my	identity	as	a	writer	i	did not	start	out	as	a	writer	i	became	one
through	my	habits

of	course	your	habits	are	not	the	only	actions	that	influence	your

identity	but	by	virtue	of	their	frequency	they	are	usually	the	most
important	ones	each	experience	in	life	modifies	your	selfimage	but
its	unlikely	you	would	consider	yourself	a	soccer	player	because	you
kicked	a	ball	once	or	an	artist	because	you	scribbled	a	picture	as	you
repeat	these	actions	however	the	evidence	accumulates	and	your	self
image	begins	to	change	the	effect	of	oneoff	experiences	tends	to	fade
away	while	the	effect	of	habits	gets	reinforced	with	time	which	means
your	habits	contribute	most	of	the	evidence	that	shapes	your	identity
in	this	way	the	process	of	building	habits	is	actually	the	process	of
becoming	yourself

this	is	a	gradual	evolution	we	do	not	change	by	snapping	our

fingers	and	deciding	to	be	someone	entirely	new	we	change	bit	by	bit
day	by	day	habit	by	habit	we	are	continually	undergoing
microevolutions	of	the	self

each	habit	is	like	a	suggestion	hey	maybe	this	is	who	i	am	if	you

finish	a	book	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person	who	likes
reading	if	you	go	to	the	gym	then	perhaps	you	are	the	type	of	person
who	likes	exercise	if	you	practice	playing	the	guitar	perhaps	you	are
the	type	of	person	who	likes	music

every	action	you	take	is	a	vote	for	the	type	of	person	you	wish	to
become	no	single	instance	will	transform	your	beliefs	but	as	the	votes
build	up	so	does	the	evidence	of	your	new	identity	this	is	one	reason
why	meaningful	change	does	not	require	radical	change	small	habits
can	make	a	meaningful	difference	by	providing	evidence	of	a	new
identity	and	if	a	change	is	meaningful	it	actually	is	big	that is	the
paradox	of	making	small	improvements

putting	this	all	together	you	can	see	that	habits	are	the	path	to
changing	your	identity	the	most	practical	way	to	change	who	you	are
is	to	change	what	you	do

each	time	you	write	a	page	you	are	a	writer

each	time	you	practice	the	violin	you	are	a	musician

each	time	you	start	a	workout	you	are	an	athlete

each	time	you	encourage	your	employees	you	are	a	leader

each	habit	not	only	gets	results	but	also	teaches	you	something	far
more	important	to	trust	yourself	you	start	to	believe	you	can	actually
accomplish	these	things	when	the	votes	mount	up	and	the	evidence
begins	to	change	the	story	you	tell	yourself	begins	to	change	as	well

of	course	it	works	the	opposite	way	too	every	time	you	choose	to
perform	a	bad	habit	its	a	vote	for	that	identity	the	good	news	is	that
you	do not	need	to	be	perfect	in	any	election	there	are	going	to	be	votes
for	both	sides	you	do not	need	a	unanimous	vote	to	win	an	election
you	just	need	a	majority	it	does not	matter	if	you	cast	a	few	votes	for	a
bad	behavior	or	an	unproductive	habit	your	goal	is	simply	to	win	the
majority	of	the	time

new	identities	require	new	evidence	if	you	keep	casting	the	same

votes	you have	always	cast	you are	going	to	get	the	same	results	you have
always	had	if	nothing	changes	nothing	is	going	to	change

it	is	a	simple	twostep	process

1	 decide	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be

2	 prove	it	to	yourself	with	small	wins

first	decide	who	you	want	to	be	this	holds	at	any	levelas	an
individual	as	a	team	as	a	community	as	a	nation	what	do	you	want
to	stand	for	what	are	your	principles	and	values	who	do	you	wish	to
become

these	are	big	questions	and	many	people	are not	sure	where	to	begin

but	they	do	know	what	kind	of	results	they	want	to	get	sixpack	abs
or	to	feel	less	anxious	or	to	double	their	salary	that is	fine	start	there
and	work	backward	from	the	results	you	want	to	the	type	of	person
who	could	get	those	results	ask	yourself	who	is	the	type	of	person
that	could	get	the	outcome	i	want	who	is	the	type	of	person	that
could	lose	forty	pounds	who	is	the	type	of	person	that	could	learn	a
new	language	who	is	the	type	of	person	that	could	run	a	successful
startup

for	example	who	is	the	type	of	person	who	could	write	a	book
its	probably	someone	who	is	consistent	and	reliable	now	your	focus
shifts	from	writing	a	book	outcomebased	to	being	the	type	of	person
who	is	consistent	and	reliable	identitybased

this	process	can	lead	to	beliefs	like

i am	the	kind	of	teacher	who	stands	up	for	her	students

i am	the	kind	of	doctor	who	gives	each	patient	the	time	and
empathy	they	need

i am	the	kind	of	manager	who	advocates	for	her	employees

once	you	have	a	handle	on	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be	you
can	begin	taking	small	steps	to	reinforce	your	desired	identity	i	have	a
friend	who	lost	over	100	pounds	by	asking	herself	what	would	a
healthy	person	do	all	day	long	she	would	use	this	question	as	a
guide	would	a	healthy	person	walk	or	take	a	cab	would	a	healthy
person	order	a	burrito	or	a	salad	she	figured	if	she	acted	like	a	healthy
person	long	enough	eventually	she	would	become	that	person	she
was	right

the	concept	of	identitybased	habits	is	our	first	introduction	to
another	key	theme	in	this	book	feedback	loops	your	habits	shape
your	identity	and	your	identity	shapes	your	habits	its	a	twoway
street	the	formation	of	all	habits	is	a	feedback	loop	a	concept	we	will
explore	in	depth	in	the	next	chapter	but	its	important	to	let	your
values	principles	and	identity	drive	the	loop	rather	than	your	results
the	focus	should	always	be	on	becoming	that	type	of	person	not
getting	a	particular	outcome

the	real	reason	habits	matter

identity	change	is	the	north	star	of	habit	change	the	remainder	of
this	book	will	provide	you	with	stepbystep	instructions	on	how	to
build	better	habits	in	yourself	your	family	your	team	your	company
and	anywhere	else	you	wish	but	the	true	question	is	are	you
becoming	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	become	the	first	step	is	not
what	or	how	but	who	you	need	to	know	who	you	want	to	be
otherwise	your	quest	for	change	is	like	a	boat	without	a	rudder	and
that is	why	we	are	starting	here

you	have	the	power	to	change	your	beliefs	about	yourself	your
identity	is	not	set	in	stone	you	have	a	choice	in	every	moment	you
can	choose	the	identity	you	want	to	reinforce	today	with	the	habits	you
choose	today	and	this	brings	us	to	the	deeper	purpose	of	this	book
and	the	real	reason	habits	matter

building	better	habits	is not	about	littering	your	day	with	life	hacks

its	not	about	flossing	one	tooth	each	night	or	taking	a	cold	shower
each	morning	or	wearing	the	same	outfit	each	day	its	not	about
achieving	external	measures	of	success	like	earning	more	money
losing	weight	or	reducing	stress	habits	can	help	you	achieve	all	of
these	things	but	fundamentally	they	are	not	about	having	something
they	are	about	becoming	someone

ultimately	your	habits	matter	because	they	help	you	become	the
type	of	person	you	wish	to	be	they	are	the	channel	through	which	you
develop	your	deepest	beliefs	about	yourself	quite	literally	you	become
your	habits

chapter	summary

there	are	three	levels	of	change	outcome	change	process	change
and	identity	change

the	most	effective	way	to	change	your	habits	is	to	focus	not	on
what	you	want	to	achieve	but	on	who	you	wish	to	become

your	identity	emerges	out	of	your	habits	every	action	is	a	vote	for
the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become

becoming	the	best	version	of	yourself	requires	you	to
continuously	edit	your	beliefs	and	to	upgrade	and	expand	your
identity

the	real	reason	habits	matter	is	not	because	they	can	get	you
better	results	although	they	can	do	that	but	because	they	can
change	your	beliefs	about	yourself

how	to	build	better	habits	in	4	simple
steps

i

n	1898	a	psychologist	named	edward	thorndike	conducted	an
experiment	that	would	lay	the	foundation	for	our	understanding	of
how	habits	form	and	the	rules	that	guide	our	behavior	thorndike	was
interested	in	studying	the	behavior	of	animals	and	he	started	by
working	with	cats

he	would	place	each	cat	inside	a	device	known	as	a	puzzle	box	the
box	was	designed	so	that	the	cat	could	escape	through	a	door	by	some
simple	act	such	as	pulling	at	a	loop	of	cord	pressing	a	lever	or
stepping	on	a	platform	for	example	one	box	contained	a	lever	that
when	pressed	would	open	a	door	on	the	side	of	the	box	once	the	door
had	been	opened	the	cat	could	dart	out	and	run	over	to	a	bowl	of	food

most	cats	wanted	to	escape	as	soon	as	they	were	placed	inside	the

box	they	would	poke	their	nose	into	the	corners	stick	their	paws
through	openings	and	claw	at	loose	objects	after	a	few	minutes	of
exploration	the	cats	would	happen	to	press	the	magical	lever	the	door
would	open	and	they	would	escape

thorndike	tracked	the	behavior	of	each	cat	across	many	trials	in
the	beginning	the	animals	moved	around	the	box	at	random	but	as
soon	as	the	lever	had	been	pressed	and	the	door	opened	the	process	of
learning	began	gradually	each	cat	learned	to	associate	the	action	of
pressing	the	lever	with	the	reward	of	escaping	the	box	and	getting	to
the	food

after	twenty	to	thirty	trials	this	behavior	became	so	automatic	and
habitual	that	the	cat	could	escape	within	a	few	seconds	for	example

thorndike	noted	cat	12	took	the	following	times	to	perform	the	act
160	seconds	30	seconds	90	seconds	60	15	28	20	30	22	11	15	20
12	10	14	10	8	8	5	10	8	6	6	7

during	the	first	three	trials	the	cat	escaped	in	an	average	of	15
minutes	during	the	last	three	trials	it	escaped	in	an	average	of	63
seconds	with	practice	each	cat	made	fewer	errors	and	their	actions
became	quicker	and	more	automatic	rather	than	repeat	the	same
mistakes	the	cat	began	to	cut	straight	to	the	solution

from	his	studies	thorndike	described	the	learning	process	by
stating	behaviors	followed	by	satisfying	consequences	tend	to	be
repeated	and	those	that	produce	unpleasant	consequences	are	less
likely	to	be	repeated	his	work	provides	the	perfect	starting	point	for
discussing	how	habits	form	in	our	own	lives	it	also	provides	answers
to	some	fundamental	questions	like	what	are	habits	and	why	does
the	brain	bother	building	them	at	all

why	your	brain	builds	habits

a	habit	is	a	behavior	that	has	been	repeated	enough	times	to	become
automatic	the	process	of	habit	formation	begins	with	trial	and	error
whenever	you	encounter	a	new	situation	in	life	your	brain	has	to
make	a	decision	how	do	i	respond	to	this	the	first	time	you	come
across	a	problem	you are	not	sure	how	to	solve	it	like	thorndikes	cat
you are	just	trying	things	out	to	see	what	works

neurological	activity	in	the	brain	is	high	during	this	period	you	are
carefully	analyzing	the	situation	and	making	conscious	decisions	about
how	to	act	you are	taking	in	tons	of	new	information	and	trying	to
make	sense	of	it	all	the	brain	is	busy	learning	the	most	effective
course	of	action

occasionally	like	a	cat	pressing	on	a	lever	you	stumble	across	a
solution	you are	feeling	anxious	and	you	discover	that	going	for	a	run
calms	you	down	you are	mentally	exhausted	from	a	long	day	of	work
and	you	learn	that	playing	video	games	relaxes	you	you are	exploring
exploring	exploring	and	thenbama	reward

after	you	stumble	upon	an	unexpected	reward	you	alter	your
strategy	for	next	time	your	brain	immediately	begins	to	catalog	the

events	that	preceded	the	reward	wait	a	minutethat	felt	good	what
did	i	do	right	before	that

this	is	the	feedback	loop	behind	all	human	behavior	try	fail	learn

try	differently	with	practice	the	useless	movements	fade	away	and
the	useful	actions	get	reinforced	that is	a	habit	forming

whenever	you	face	a	problem	repeatedly	your	brain	begins	to
automate	the	process	of	solving	it	your	habits	are	just	a	series	of
automatic	solutions	that	solve	the	problems	and	stresses	you	face
regularly	as	behavioral	scientist	jason	hreha	writes	habits	are
simply	reliable	solutions	to	recurring	problems	in	our	environment

as	habits	are	created	the	level	of	activity	in	the	brain	decreases

you	learn	to	lock	in	on	the	cues	that	predict	success	and	tune	out
everything	else	when	a	similar	situation	arises	in	the	future	you	know
exactly	what	to	look	for	there	is	no	longer	a	need	to	analyze	every
angle	of	a	situation	your	brain	skips	the	process	of	trial	and	error	and
creates	a	mental	rule	if	this	then	that	these	cognitive	scripts	can	be
followed	automatically	whenever	the	situation	is	appropriate	now
whenever	you	feel	stressed	you	get	the	itch	to	run	as	soon	as	you	walk
in	the	door	from	work	you	grab	the	video	game	controller	a	choice
that	once	required	effort	is	now	automatic	a	habit	has	been	created

habits	are	mental	shortcuts	learned	from	experience	in	a	sense	a
habit	is	just	a	memory	of	the	steps	you	previously	followed	to	solve	a
problem	in	the	past	whenever	the	conditions	are	right	you	can	draw
on	this	memory	and	automatically	apply	the	same	solution	the
primary	reason	the	brain	remembers	the	past	is	to	better	predict	what
will	work	in	the	future

habit	formation	is	incredibly	useful	because	the	conscious	mind	is
the	bottleneck	of	the	brain	it	can	only	pay	attention	to	one	problem	at
a	time	as	a	result	your	brain	is	always	working	to	preserve	your
conscious	attention	for	whatever	task	is	most	essential	whenever
possible	the	conscious	mind	likes	to	pawn	off	tasks	to	the
nonconscious	mind	to	do	automatically	this	is	precisely	what	happens
when	a	habit	is	formed	habits	reduce	cognitive	load	and	free	up
mental	capacity	so	you	can	allocate	your	attention	to	other	tasks

despite	their	efficiency	some	people	still	wonder	about	the	benefits
of	habits	the	argument	goes	like	this	will	habits	make	my	life	dull	i
do not	want	to	pigeonhole	myself	into	a	lifestyle	i	do not	enjoy	does not

so	much	routine	take	away	the	vibrancy	and	spontaneity	of	life
hardly	such	questions	set	up	a	false	dichotomy	they	make	you	think
that	you	have	to	choose	between	building	habits	and	attaining
freedom	in	reality	the	two	complement	each	other

habits	do	not	restrict	freedom	they	create	it	in	fact	the	people
who	do not	have	their	habits	handled	are	often	the	ones	with	the	least
amount	of	freedom	without	good	financial	habits	you	will	always	be
struggling	for	the	next	dollar	without	good	health	habits	you	will
always	seem	to	be	short	on	energy	without	good	learning	habits	you
will	always	feel	like	you are	behind	the	curve	if	you are	always	being
forced	to	make	decisions	about	simple	taskswhen	should	i	work	out
where	do	i	go	to	write	when	do	i	pay	the	billsthen	you	have	less	time
for	freedom	its	only	by	making	the	fundamentals	of	life	easier	that
you	can	create	the	mental	space	needed	for	free	thinking	and
creativity

conversely	when	you	have	your	habits	dialed	in	and	the	basics	of
life	are	handled	and	done	your	mind	is	free	to	focus	on	new	challenges
and	master	the	next	set	of	problems	building	habits	in	the	present
allows	you	to	do	more	of	what	you	want	in	the	future

the	science	of	how	habits	work

the	process	of	building	a	habit	can	be	divided	into	four	simple	steps
cue	craving	response	and	reward	breaking	it	down	into	these
fundamental	parts	can	help	us	understand	what	a	habit	is	how	it
works	and	how	to	improve	it

figure	5	all	habits	proceed	through	four	stages	in	the	same	order	cue
craving	response	and	reward

this	fourstep	pattern	is	the	backbone	of	every	habit	and	your	brain

runs	through	these	steps	in	the	same	order	each	time

first	there	is	the	cue	the	cue	triggers	your	brain	to	initiate	a

behavior	it	is	a	bit	of	information	that	predicts	a	reward	our
prehistoric	ancestors	were	paying	attention	to	cues	that	signaled	the
location	of	primary	rewards	like	food	water	and	sex	today	we	spend
most	of	our	time	learning	cues	that	predict	secondary	rewards	like
money	and	fame	power	and	status	praise	and	approval	love	and
friendship	or	a	sense	of	personal	satisfaction	of	course	these
pursuits	also	indirectly	improve	our	odds	of	survival	and	reproduction
which	is	the	deeper	motive	behind	everything	we	do

your	mind	is	continuously	analyzing	your	internal	and	external
environment	for	hints	of	where	rewards	are	located	because	the	cue	is
the	first	indication	that	were	close	to	a	reward	it	naturally	leads	to	a
craving

cravings	are	the	second	step	and	they	are	the	motivational	force

behind	every	habit	without	some	level	of	motivation	or	desire
without	craving	a	changewe	have	no	reason	to	act	what	you	crave	is
not	the	habit	itself	but	the	change	in	state	it	delivers	you	do	not	crave
smoking	a	cigarette	you	crave	the	feeling	of	relief	it	provides	you	are
not	motivated	by	brushing	your	teeth	but	rather	by	the	feeling	of	a
clean	mouth	you	do	not	want	to	turn	on	the	television	you	want	to	be
entertained	every	craving	is	linked	to	a	desire	to	change	your	internal
state	this	is	an	important	point	that	we	will	discuss	in	detail	later

cravings	differ	from	person	to	person	in	theory	any	piece	of
information	could	trigger	a	craving	but	in	practice	people	are	not
motivated	by	the	same	cues	for	a	gambler	the	sound	of	slot	machines
can	be	a	potent	trigger	that	sparks	an	intense	wave	of	desire	for
someone	who	rarely	gambles	the	jingles	and	chimes	of	the	casino	are
just	background	noise	cues	are	meaningless	until	they	are	interpreted
the	thoughts	feelings	and	emotions	of	the	observer	are	what
transform	a	cue	into	a	craving

the	third	step	is	the	response	the	response	is	the	actual	habit	you
perform	which	can	take	the	form	of	a	thought	or	an	action	whether	a
response	occurs	depends	on	how	motivated	you	are	and	how	much
friction	is	associated	with	the	behavior	if	a	particular	action	requires
more	physical	or	mental	effort	than	you	are	willing	to	expend	then	you
will not	do	it	your	response	also	depends	on	your	ability	it	sounds
simple	but	a	habit	can	occur	only	if	you	are	capable	of	doing	it	if	you

want	to	dunk	a	basketball	but	cannot	jump	high	enough	to	reach	the
hoop	well	you are	out	of	luck

finally	the	response	delivers	a	reward	rewards	are	the	end	goal	of
every	habit	the	cue	is	about	noticing	the	reward	the	craving	is	about
wanting	the	reward	the	response	is	about	obtaining	the	reward	we
chase	rewards	because	they	serve	two	purposes	1	they	satisfy	us	and
2	they	teach	us

the	first	purpose	of	rewards	is	to	satisfy	your	craving	yes	rewards

provide	benefits	on	their	own	food	and	water	deliver	the	energy	you
need	to	survive	getting	a	promotion	brings	more	money	and	respect
getting	in	shape	improves	your	health	and	your	dating	prospects	but
the	more	immediate	benefit	is	that	rewards	satisfy	your	craving	to	eat
or	to	gain	status	or	to	win	approval	at	least	for	a	moment	rewards
deliver	contentment	and	relief	from	craving

second	rewards	teach	us	which	actions	are	worth	remembering	in
the	future	your	brain	is	a	reward	detector	as	you	go	about	your	life
your	sensory	nervous	system	is	continuously	monitoring	which	actions
satisfy	your	desires	and	deliver	pleasure	feelings	of	pleasure	and
disappointment	are	part	of	the	feedback	mechanism	that	helps	your
brain	distinguish	useful	actions	from	useless	ones	rewards	close	the
feedback	loop	and	complete	the	habit	cycle

if	a	behavior	is	insufficient	in	any	of	the	four	stages	it	will	not
become	a	habit	eliminate	the	cue	and	your	habit	will	never	start
reduce	the	craving	and	you	will not	experience	enough	motivation	to
act	make	the	behavior	difficult	and	you	will not	be	able	to	do	it	and	if
the	reward	fails	to	satisfy	your	desire	then	you will	have	no	reason	to	do
it	again	in	the	future	without	the	first	three	steps	a	behavior	will	not
occur	without	all	four	a	behavior	will	not	be	repeated

the	habit	loop

figure	6	the	four	stages	of	habit	are	best	described	as	a	feedback	loop
they	form	an	endless	cycle	that	is	running	every	moment	you	are	alive	this
habit	loop	is	continually	scanning	the	environment	predicting	what	will
happen	next	trying	out	different	responses	and	learning	from	the	results

in	summary	the	cue	triggers	a	craving	which	motivates	a	response

which	provides	a	reward	which	satisfies	the	craving	and	ultimately
becomes	associated	with	the	cue	together	these	four	steps	form	a
neurological	feedback	loopcue	craving	response	reward	cue
craving	response	rewardthat	ultimately	allows	you	to	create
automatic	habits	this	cycle	is	known	as	the	habit	loop

this	fourstep	process	is	not	something	that	happens	occasionally

but	rather	it	is	an	endless	feedback	loop	that	is	running	and	active
during	every	moment	you	are	aliveeven	now	the	brain	is	continually
scanning	the	environment	predicting	what	will	happen	next	trying
out	different	responses	and	learning	from	the	results	the	entire
process	is	completed	in	a	split	second	and	we	use	it	again	and	again
without	realizing	everything	that	has	been	packed	into	the	previous
moment

we	can	split	these	four	steps	into	two	phases	the	problem	phase
and	the	solution	phase	the	problem	phase	includes	the	cue	and	the
craving	and	it	is	when	you	realize	that	something	needs	to	change	the
solution	phase	includes	the	response	and	the	reward	and	it	is	when
you	take	action	and	achieve	the	change	you	desire

1	cue

2	craving

3	response

4	reward

problem	phase

solution	phase

all	behavior	is	driven	by	the	desire	to	solve	a	problem	sometimes
the	problem	is	that	you	notice	something	good	and	you	want	to	obtain
it	sometimes	the	problem	is	that	you	are	experiencing	pain	and	you
want	to	relieve	it	either	way	the	purpose	of	every	habit	is	to	solve	the
problems	you	face

in	the	table	on	the	following	page	you	can	see	a	few	examples	of

what	this	looks	like	in	real	life

imagine	walking	into	a	dark	room	and	flipping	on	the	light	switch

you	have	performed	this	simple	habit	so	many	times	that	it	occurs
without	thinking	you	proceed	through	all	four	stages	in	the	fraction	of
a	second	the	urge	to	act	strikes	you	without	thinking

problem	phase

1	cue	your	phone	buzzes	with	a	new	text	message

with	being	in	a	dark	room

by	the	time	we	become	adults	we	rarely	notice	the	habits	that	are
running	our	lives	most	of	us	never	give	a	second	thought	to	the	fact
that	we	tie	the	same	shoe	first	each	morning	or	unplug	the	toaster
after	each	use	or	always	change	into	comfortable	clothes	after	getting
home	from	work	after	decades	of	mental	programming	we
automatically	slip	into	these	patterns	of	thinking	and	acting

the	four	laws	of	behavior	change

in	the	following	chapters	we	will	see	time	and	again	how	the	four
stages	of	cue	craving	response	and	reward	influence	nearly
everything	we	do	each	day	but	before	we	do	that	we	need	to

transform	these	four	steps	into	a	practical	framework	that	we	can	use
to	design	good	habits	and	eliminate	bad	ones

i	refer	to	this	framework	as	the	four	laws	of	behavior	change	and

it	provides	a	simple	set	of	rules	for	creating	good	habits	and	breaking
bad	ones	you	can	think	of	each	law	as	a	lever	that	influences	human
behavior	when	the	levers	are	in	the	right	positions	creating	good
habits	is	effortless	when	they	are	in	the	wrong	positions	it	is	nearly
impossible

how	to	create	a	good	habit

the	1st	law	cue	make	it	obvious

the	2nd	law	craving	make	it	attractive

the	3rd	law	response	make	it	easy

the	4th	law	reward	make	it	satisfying

we	can	invert	these	laws	to	learn	how	to	break	a	bad	habit

how	to	break	a	bad	habit

inversion	of	the	1st	law	cue	make	it	invisible

inversion	of	the	2nd	law	craving	make	it	unattractive

inversion	of	the	3rd	law	response	make	it	difficult

inversion	of	the	4th	law	reward	make	it	unsatisfying

it	would	be	irresponsible	for	me	to	claim	that	these	four	laws	are	an

exhaustive	framework	for	changing	any	human	behavior	but	i	think
they are	close	as	you	will	soon	see	the	four	laws	of	behavior	change
apply	to	nearly	every	field	from	sports	to	politics	art	to	medicine
comedy	to	management	these	laws	can	be	used	no	matter	what
challenge	you	are	facing	there	is	no	need	for	completely	different
strategies	for	each	habit

whenever	you	want	to	change	your	behavior	you	can	simply	ask

yourself

1	 how	can	i	make	it	obvious

2	 how	can	i	make	it	attractive

3	 how	can	i	make	it	easy

4	 how	can	i	make	it	satisfying

if	you	have	ever	wondered	why	do not	i	do	what	i	say	i am	going	to
do	why	do not	i	lose	the	weight	or	stop	smoking	or	save	for	retirement
or	start	that	side	business	why	do	i	say	something	is	important	but
never	seem	to	make	time	for	it	the	answers	to	those	questions	can	be
found	somewhere	in	these	four	laws	the	key	to	creating	good	habits
and	breaking	bad	ones	is	to	understand	these	fundamental	laws	and
how	to	alter	them	to	your	specifications	every	goal	is	doomed	to	fail	if
it	goes	against	the	grain	of	human	nature

your	habits	are	shaped	by	the	systems	in	your	life	in	the	chapters
that	follow	we	will	discuss	these	laws	one	by	one	and	show	how	you
can	use	them	to	create	a	system	in	which	good	habits	emerge	naturally
and	bad	habits	wither	away

chapter	summary

a	habit	is	a	behavior	that	has	been	repeated	enough	times	to
become	automatic

the	ultimate	purpose	of	habits	is	to	solve	the	problems	of	life	with

the	man	who	did not	look	right

the	psychologist	gary	klein	once	told	me	a	story	about	a	woman	who
attended	a	family	gathering	she	had	spent	years	working	as	a
paramedic	and	upon	arriving	at	the	event	took	one	look	at	her	father
inlaw	and	got	very	concerned

i	do not	like	the	way	you	look	she	said

her	fatherinlaw	who	was	feeling	perfectly	fine	jokingly	replied

well	i	do not	like	your	looks	either

no	she	insisted	you	need	to	go	to	the	hospital	now

a	few	hours	later	the	man	was	undergoing	lifesaving	surgery	after
an	examination	had	revealed	that	he	had	a	blockage	to	a	major	artery
and	was	at	immediate	risk	of	a	heart	attack	without	his	daughterin
laws	intuition	he	could	have	died

what	did	the	paramedic	see	how	did	she	predict	his	impending

heart	attack

when	major	arteries	are	obstructed	the	body	focuses	on	sending
blood	to	critical	organs	and	away	from	peripheral	locations	near	the
surface	of	the	skin	the	result	is	a	change	in	the	pattern	of	distribution
of	blood	in	the	face	after	many	years	of	working	with	people	with
heart	failure	the	woman	had	unknowingly	developed	the	ability	to
recognize	this	pattern	on	sight	she	could not	explain	what	it	was	that
she	noticed	in	her	fatherinlaws	face	but	she	knew	something	was
wrong

similar	stories	exist	in	other	fields	for	example	military	analysts

can	identify	which	blip	on	a	radar	screen	is	an	enemy	missile	and

which	one	is	a	plane	from	their	own	fleet	even	though	they	are
traveling	at	the	same	speed	flying	at	the	same	altitude	and	look
identical	on	radar	in	nearly	every	respect	during	the	gulf	war
lieutenant	commander	michael	riley	saved	an	entire	battleship	when
he	ordered	a	missile	shot	downdespite	the	fact	that	it	looked	exactly
like	the	battleships	own	planes	on	radar	he	made	the	right	call	but
even	his	superior	officers	could not	explain	how	he	did	it

museum	curators	have	been	known	to	discern	the	difference

between	an	authentic	piece	of	art	and	an	expertly	produced	counterfeit
even	though	they	cannot	tell	you	precisely	which	details	tipped	them	off
experienced	radiologists	can	look	at	a	brain	scan	and	predict	the	area
where	a	stroke	will	develop	before	any	obvious	signs	are	visible	to	the
untrained	eye	i have	even	heard	of	hairdressers	noticing	whether	a	client
is	pregnant	based	only	on	the	feel	of	her	hair

the	human	brain	is	a	prediction	machine	it	is	continuously	taking

in	your	surroundings	and	analyzing	the	information	it	comes	across
whenever	you	experience	something	repeatedlylike	a	paramedic
seeing	the	face	of	a	heart	attack	patient	or	a	military	analyst	seeing	a
missile	on	a	radar	screenyour	brain	begins	noticing	what	is
important	sorting	through	the	details	and	highlighting	the	relevant
cues	and	cataloging	that	information	for	future	use

with	enough	practice	you	can	pick	up	on	the	cues	that	predict

certain	outcomes	without	consciously	thinking	about	it	automatically
your	brain	encodes	the	lessons	learned	through	experience	we	cannot
always	explain	what	it	is	we	are	learning	but	learning	is	happening	all
along	the	way	and	your	ability	to	notice	the	relevant	cues	in	a	given
situation	is	the	foundation	for	every	habit	you	have

we	underestimate	how	much	our	brains	and	bodies	can	do	without

thinking	you	do	not	tell	your	hair	to	grow	your	heart	to	pump	your
lungs	to	breathe	or	your	stomach	to	digest	and	yet	your	body	handles
all	this	and	more	on	autopilot	you	are	much	more	than	your	conscious
self

consider	hunger	how	do	you	know	when	you are	hungry	you	do not
necessarily	have	to	see	a	cookie	on	the	counter	to	realize	that	it	is	time
to	eat	appetite	and	hunger	are	governed	nonconsciously	your	body
has	a	variety	of	feedback	loops	that	gradually	alert	you	when	it	is	time
to	eat	again	and	that	track	what	is	going	on	around	you	and	within	you
cravings	can	arise	thanks	to	hormones	and	chemicals	circulating

through	your	body	suddenly	you are	hungry	even	though	you are	not
quite	sure	what	tipped	you	off

this	is	one	of	the	most	surprising	insights	about	our	habits	you
do not	need	to	be	aware	of	the	cue	for	a	habit	to	begin	you	can	notice	an
opportunity	and	take	action	without	dedicating	conscious	attention	to
it	this	is	what	makes	habits	useful

its	also	what	makes	them	dangerous	as	habits	form	your	actions
come	under	the	direction	of	your	automatic	and	nonconscious	mind
you	fall	into	old	patterns	before	you	realize	what is	happening	unless
someone	points	it	out	you	may	not	notice	that	you	cover	your	mouth
with	your	hand	whenever	you	laugh	that	you	apologize	before	asking	a
question	or	that	you	have	a	habit	of	finishing	other	peoples	sentences
and	the	more	you	repeat	these	patterns	the	less	likely	you	become	to
question	what	you are	doing	and	why	you are	doing	it

i	once	heard	of	a	retail	clerk	who	was	instructed	to	cut	up	empty	gift

cards	after	customers	had	used	up	the	balance	on	the	card	one	day
the	clerk	cashed	out	a	few	customers	in	a	row	who	purchased	with	gift
cards	when	the	next	person	walked	up	the	clerk	swiped	the
customers	actual	credit	card	picked	up	the	scissors	and	then	cut	it	in
halfentirely	on	autopilotbefore	looking	up	at	the	stunned	customer
and	realizing	what	had	just	happened

another	woman	i	came	across	in	my	research	was	a	former

preschool	teacher	who	had	switched	to	a	corporate	job	even	though
she	was	now	working	with	adults	her	old	habits	would	kick	in	and	she
kept	asking	coworkers	if	they	had	washed	their	hands	after	going	to	the
bathroom	i	also	found	the	story	of	a	man	who	had	spent	years
working	as	a	lifeguard	and	would	occasionally	yell	walk	whenever
he	saw	a	child	running

over	time	the	cues	that	spark	our	habits	become	so	common	that

they	are	essentially	invisible	the	treats	on	the	kitchen	counter	the
remote	control	next	to	the	couch	the	phone	in	our	pocket	our
responses	to	these	cues	are	so	deeply	encoded	that	it	may	feel	like	the
urge	to	act	comes	from	nowhere	for	this	reason	we	must	begin	the
process	of	behavior	change	with	awareness

before	we	can	effectively	build	new	habits	we	need	to	get	a	handle

on	our	current	ones	this	can	be	more	challenging	than	it	sounds
because	once	a	habit	is	firmly	rooted	in	your	life	it	is	mostly

nonconscious	and	automatic	if	a	habit	remains	mindless	you	cannot
expect	to	improve	it	as	the	psychologist	carl	jung	said	until	you
make	the	unconscious	conscious	it	will	direct	your	life	and	you	will
call	it	fate

the	habits	scorecard

the	japanese	railway	system	is	regarded	as	one	of	the	best	in	the
world	if	you	ever	find	yourself	riding	a	train	in	tokyo	you will	notice
that	the	conductors	have	a	peculiar	habit

as	each	operator	runs	the	train	they	proceed	through	a	ritual	of
pointing	at	different	objects	and	calling	out	commands	when	the	train
approaches	a	signal	the	operator	will	point	at	it	and	say	signal	is
green	as	the	train	pulls	into	and	out	of	each	station	the	operator	will
point	at	the	speedometer	and	call	out	the	exact	speed	when	its	time
to	leave	the	operator	will	point	at	the	timetable	and	state	the	time	out
on	the	platform	other	employees	are	performing	similar	actions
before	each	train	departs	staff	members	will	point	along	the	edge	of
the	platform	and	declare	all	clear	every	detail	is	identified	pointed
at	and	named	aloud

this	process	known	as	pointingandcalling	is	a	safety	system
designed	to	reduce	mistakes	it	seems	silly	but	it	works	incredibly
well	pointingandcalling	reduces	errors	by	up	to	85	percent	and	cuts
accidents	by	30	percent	the	mta	subway	system	in	new	york	city
adopted	a	modified	version	that	is	pointonly	and	within	two	years
of	implementation	incidents	of	incorrectly	berthed	subways	fell	57
percent

pointingandcalling	is	so	effective	because	it	raises	the	level	of

awareness	from	a	nonconscious	habit	to	a	more	conscious	level
because	the	train	operators	must	use	their	eyes	hands	mouth	and
ears	they	are	more	likely	to	notice	problems	before	something	goes
wrong

my	wife	does	something	similar	whenever	we	are	preparing	to
walk	out	the	door	for	a	trip	she	verbally	calls	out	the	most	essential
items	in	her	packing	list	i have	got	my	keys	i have	got	my	wallet	i have	got
my	glasses	i have	got	my	husband

the	more	automatic	a	behavior	becomes	the	less	likely	we	are	to

consciously	think	about	it	and	when	we have	done	something	a
thousand	times	before	we	begin	to	overlook	things	we	assume	that
the	next	time	will	be	just	like	the	last	were	so	used	to	doing	what
we have	always	done	that	we	do not	stop	to	question	whether	its	the	right
thing	to	do	at	all	many	of	our	failures	in	performance	are	largely
attributable	to	a	lack	of	selfawareness

one	of	our	greatest	challenges	in	changing	habits	is	maintaining
awareness	of	what	we	are	actually	doing	this	helps	explain	why	the
consequences	of	bad	habits	can	sneak	up	on	us	we	need	a	pointand
call	system	for	our	personal	lives	that is	the	origin	of	the	habits
scorecard	which	is	a	simple	exercise	you	can	use	to	become	more
aware	of	your	behavior	to	create	your	own	make	a	list	of	your	daily
habits

here is	a	sample	of	where	your	list	might	start

wake	up

turn	off	alarm

check	my	phone

go	to	the	bathroom

weigh	myself

take	a	shower

brush	my	teeth

floss	my	teeth

put	on	deodorant

hang	up	towel	to	dry

get	dressed

make	a	cup	of	tea

			and	so	on

once	you	have	a	full	list	look	at	each	behavior	and	ask	yourself	is
this	a	good	habit	a	bad	habit	or	a	neutral	habit	if	it	is	a	good	habit
write		next	to	it	if	it	is	a	bad	habit	write		if	it	is	a	neutral	habit
write	

for	example	the	list	above	might	look	like	this

wake	up	

turn	off	alarm	

check	my	phone	

go	to	the	bathroom	

weigh	myself	

take	a	shower	

brush	my	teeth	

floss	my	teeth	

put	on	deodorant	

hang	up	towel	to	dry	

get	dressed	

make	a	cup	of	tea	

the	marks	you	give	to	a	particular	habit	will	depend	on	your
situation	and	your	goals	for	someone	who	is	trying	to	lose	weight
eating	a	bagel	with	peanut	butter	every	morning	might	be	a	bad	habit
for	someone	who	is	trying	to	bulk	up	and	add	muscle	the	same
behavior	might	be	a	good	habit	it	all	depends	on	what	you are	working
toward

scoring	your	habits	can	be	a	bit	more	complex	for	another	reason	as

well	the	labels	good	habit	and	bad	habit	are	slightly	inaccurate
there	are	no	good	habits	or	bad	habits	there	are	only	effective	habits
that	is	effective	at	solving	problems	all	habits	serve	you	in	some	way
even	the	bad	oneswhich	is	why	you	repeat	them	for	this	exercise
categorize	your	habits	by	how	they	will	benefit	you	in	the	long	run
generally	speaking	good	habits	will	have	net	positive	outcomes	bad
habits	have	net	negative	outcomes	smoking	a	cigarette	may	reduce
stress	right	now	that is	how	its	serving	you	but	its	not	a	healthy
longterm	behavior

if	you are	still	having	trouble	determining	how	to	rate	a	particular

habit	here	is	a	question	i	like	to	use	does	this	behavior	help	me
become	the	type	of	person	i	wish	to	be	does	this	habit	cast	a	vote	for

or	against	my	desired	identity	habits	that	reinforce	your	desired
identity	are	usually	good	habits	that	conflict	with	your	desired
identity	are	usually	bad

as	you	create	your	habits	scorecard	there	is	no	need	to	change
anything	at	first	the	goal	is	to	simply	notice	what	is	actually	going	on
observe	your	thoughts	and	actions	without	judgment	or	internal
criticism	do not	blame	yourself	for	your	faults	do not	praise	yourself	for
your	successes

if	you	eat	a	chocolate	bar	every	morning	acknowledge	it	almost	as

if	you	were	watching	someone	else	oh	how	interesting	that	they
would	do	such	a	thing	if	you	bingeeat	simply	notice	that	you	are
eating	more	calories	than	you	should	if	you	waste	time	online	notice
that	you	are	spending	your	life	in	a	way	that	you	do	not	want	to

the	first	step	to	changing	bad	habits	is	to	be	on	the	lookout	for
them	if	you	feel	like	you	need	extra	help	then	you	can	try	pointing
andcalling	in	your	own	life	say	out	loud	the	action	that	you	are
thinking	of	taking	and	what	the	outcome	will	be	if	you	want	to	cut
back	on	your	junk	food	habit	but	notice	yourself	grabbing	another
cookie	say	out	loud	i am	about	to	eat	this	cookie	but	i	do not	need	it
eating	it	will	because	me	to	gain	weight	and	hurt	my	health

hearing	your	bad	habits	spoken	aloud	makes	the	consequences

seem	more	real	it	adds	weight	to	the	action	rather	than	letting
yourself	mindlessly	slip	into	an	old	routine	this	approach	is	useful
even	if	you are	simply	trying	to	remember	a	task	on	your	todo	list	just
saying	out	loud	tomorrow	i	need	to	go	to	the	post	office	after	lunch
increases	the	odds	that	you will	actually	do	it	you are	getting	yourself	to
acknowledge	the	need	for	actionand	that	can	make	all	the	difference

the	process	of	behavior	change	always	starts	with	awareness
strategies	like	pointingandcalling	and	the	habits	scorecard	are
focused	on	getting	you	to	recognize	your	habits	and	acknowledge	the
cues	that	trigger	them	which	makes	it	possible	to	respond	in	a	way
that	benefits	you

chapter	summary

with	enough	practice	your	brain	will	pick	up	on	the	cues	that
predict	certain	outcomes	without	consciously	thinking	about	it

once	our	habits	become	automatic	we	stop	paying	attention	to
what	we	are	doing

the	process	of	behavior	change	always	starts	with	awareness	you
need	to	be	aware	of	your	habits	before	you	can	change	them

pointingandcalling	raises	your	level	of	awareness	from	a
nonconscious	habit	to	a	more	conscious	level	by	verbalizing	your
actions

the	habits	scorecard	is	a	simple	exercise	you	can	use	to	become
more	aware	of	your	behavior

the	best	way	to	start	a	new	habit

i

n	2001	researchers	in	great	britain	began	working	with	248	people
to	build	better	exercise	habits	over	the	course	of	two	weeks	the

subjects	were	divided	into	three	groups

the	first	group	was	the	control	group	they	were	simply	asked	to

track	how	often	they	exercised

the	second	group	was	the	motivation	group	they	were	asked	not

only	to	track	their	workouts	but	also	to	read	some	material	on	the
benefits	of	exercise	the	researchers	also	explained	to	the	group	how
exercise	could	reduce	the	risk	of	coronary	heart	disease	and	improve
heart	health

finally	there	was	the	third	group	these	subjects	received	the	same

presentation	as	the	second	group	which	ensured	that	they	had	equal
levels	of	motivation	however	they	were	also	asked	to	formulate	a	plan
for	when	and	where	they	would	exercise	over	the	following	week
specifically	each	member	of	the	third	group	completed	the	following
sentence	during	the	next	week	i	will	partake	in	at	least	20	minutes
of	vigorous	exercise	on	day	at	time	in	place

in	the	first	and	second	groups	35	to	38	percent	of	people	exercised

at	least	once	per	week	interestingly	the	motivational	presentation
given	to	the	second	group	seemed	to	have	no	meaningful	impact	on
behavior	but	91	percent	of	the	third	group	exercised	at	least	once	per
weekmore	than	double	the	normal	rate

the	sentence	they	filled	out	is	what	researchers	refer	to	as	an

implementation	intention	which	is	a	plan	you	make	beforehand	about

when	and	where	to	act	that	is	how	you	intend	to	implement	a
particular	habit

the	cues	that	can	trigger	a	habit	come	in	a	wide	range	of	formsthe

feel	of	your	phone	buzzing	in	your	pocket	the	smell	of	chocolate	chip
cookies	the	sound	of	ambulance	sirensbut	the	two	most	common
cues	are	time	and	location	implementation	intentions	leverage	both	of
these	cues

broadly	speaking	the	format	for	creating	an	implementation
intention	is

when	situation	x	arises	i	will	perform	response	y

hundreds	of	studies	have	shown	that	implementation	intentions	are

effective	for	sticking	to	our	goals	whether	its	writing	down	the	exact
time	and	date	of	when	you	will	get	a	flu	shot	or	recording	the	time	of
your	colonoscopy	appointment	they	increase	the	odds	that	people	will
stick	with	habits	like	recycling	studying	going	to	sleep	early	and
stopping	smoking

researchers	have	even	found	that	voter	turnout	increases	when
people	are	forced	to	create	implementation	intentions	by	answering
questions	like	what	route	are	you	taking	to	the	polling	station	at
what	time	are	you	planning	to	go	what	bus	will	get	you	there	other
successful	government	programs	have	prompted	citizens	to	make	a
clear	plan	to	send	taxes	in	on	time	or	provided	directions	on	when	and
where	to	pay	late	traffic	bills

the	punch	line	is	clear	people	who	make	a	specific	plan	for	when

and	where	they	will	perform	a	new	habit	are	more	likely	to	follow
through	too	many	people	try	to	change	their	habits	without	these
basic	details	figured	out	we	tell	ourselves	i am	going	to	eat	healthier
or	i am	going	to	write	more	but	we	never	say	when	and	where	these
habits	are	going	to	happen	we	leave	it	up	to	chance	and	hope	that	we
will	just	remember	to	do	it	or	feel	motivated	at	the	right	time	an
implementation	intention	sweeps	away	foggy	notions	like	i	want	to
work	out	more	or	i	want	to	be	more	productive	or	i	should	vote
and	transforms	them	into	a	concrete	plan	of	action

many	people	think	they	lack	motivation	when	what	they	really	lack
is	clarity	it	is	not	always	obvious	when	and	where	to	take	action	some
people	spend	their	entire	lives	waiting	for	the	time	to	be	right	to	make
an	improvement

once	an	implementation	intention	has	been	set	you	do not	have	to
wait	for	inspiration	to	strike	do	i	write	a	chapter	today	or	not	do	i
meditate	this	morning	or	at	lunch	when	the	moment	of	action
occurs	there	is	no	need	to	make	a	decision	simply	follow	your
predetermined	plan

the	simple	way	to	apply	this	strategy	to	your	habits	is	to	fill
out	this	sentence

i	will	behavior	at	time	in	location

meditation	i	will	meditate	for	one	minute	at	7	am	in	my	kitchen

studying	i	will	study	spanish	for	twenty	minutes	at	6	pm	in	my
bedroom

exercise	i	will	exercise	for	one	hour	at	5	pm	in	my	local	gym

marriage	i	will	make	my	partner	a	cup	of	tea	at	8	am	in	the
kitchen

if	you	are not	sure	when	to	start	your	habit	try	the	first	day	of	the
week	month	or	year	people	are	more	likely	to	take	action	at	those
times	because	hope	is	usually	higher	if	we	have	hope	we	have	a
reason	to	take	action	a	fresh	start	feels	motivating

there	is	another	benefit	to	implementation	intentions	being

specific	about	what	you	want	and	how	you	will	achieve	it	helps	you	say
no	to	things	that	derail	progress	distract	your	attention	and	pull	you
off	course	we	often	say	yes	to	little	requests	because	we	are	not	clear
enough	about	what	we	need	to	be	doing	instead	when	your	dreams
are	vague	its	easy	to	rationalize	little	exceptions	all	day	long	and	never
get	around	to	the	specific	things	you	need	to	do	to	succeed

give	your	habits	a	time	and	a	space	to	live	in	the	world	the	goal	is
to	make	the	time	and	location	so	obvious	that	with	enough	repetition
you	get	an	urge	to	do	the	right	thing	at	the	right	time	even	if	you	cannot
say	why	as	the	writer	jason	zweig	noted	obviously	you are	never
going	to	just	work	out	without	conscious	thought	but	like	a	dog
salivating	at	a	bell	maybe	you	start	to	get	antsy	around	the	time	of	day
you	normally	work	out

there	are	many	ways	to	use	implementation	intentions	in	your	life

and	work	my	favorite	approach	is	one	i	learned	from	stanford
professor	bj	fogg	and	it	is	a	strategy	i	refer	to	as	habit	stacking

habit	stacking	a	simple	plan	to	overhaul	your
habits

the	french	philosopher	denis	diderot	lived	nearly	his	entire	life	in
poverty	but	that	all	changed	one	day	in	1765

diderots	daughter	was	about	to	be	married	and	he	could	not	afford

to	pay	for	the	wedding	despite	his	lack	of	wealth	diderot	was	well
known	for	his	role	as	the	cofounder	and	writer	of	encyclopedie	one	of
the	most	comprehensive	encyclopedias	of	the	time	when	catherine
the	great	the	empress	of	russia	heard	of	diderots	financial	troubles
her	heart	went	out	to	him	she	was	a	book	lover	and	greatly	enjoyed	his
encyclopedia	she	offered	to	buy	diderots	personal	library	for	1000
more	than	150000	today	suddenly	diderot	had	money	to	spare
with	his	new	wealth	he	not	only	paid	for	the	wedding	but	also
acquired	a	scarlet	robe	for	himself

diderots	scarlet	robe	was	beautiful	so	beautiful	in	fact	that	he
immediately	noticed	how	out	of	place	it	seemed	when	surrounded	by
his	more	common	possessions	he	wrote	that	there	was	no	more
coordination	no	more	unity	no	more	beauty	between	his	elegant	robe
and	the	rest	of	his	stuff

diderot	soon	felt	the	urge	to	upgrade	his	possessions	he	replaced

his	rug	with	one	from	damascus	he	decorated	his	home	with
expensive	sculptures	he	bought	a	mirror	to	place	above	the	mantel
and	a	better	kitchen	table	he	tossed	aside	his	old	straw	chair	for	a
leather	one	like	falling	dominoes	one	purchase	led	to	the	next

diderots	behavior	is	not	uncommon	in	fact	the	tendency	for	one

purchase	to	lead	to	another	one	has	a	name	the	diderot	effect	the
diderot	effect	states	that	obtaining	a	new	possession	often	creates	a
spiral	of	consumption	that	leads	to	additional	purchases

you	can	spot	this	pattern	everywhere	you	buy	a	dress	and	have	to
get	new	shoes	and	earrings	to	match	you	buy	a	couch	and	suddenly
question	the	layout	of	your	entire	living	room	you	buy	a	toy	for	your
child	and	soon	find	yourself	purchasing	all	of	the	accessories	that	go
with	it	its	a	chain	reaction	of	purchases

many	human	behaviors	follow	this	cycle	you	often	decide	what	to

do	next	based	on	what	you	have	just	finished	doing	going	to	the
bathroom	leads	to	washing	and	drying	your	hands	which	reminds	you
that	you	need	to	put	the	dirty	towels	in	the	laundry	so	you	add	laundry

detergent	to	the	shopping	list	and	so	on	no	behavior	happens	in
isolation	each	action	becomes	a	cue	that	triggers	the	next	behavior

why	is	this	important

when	it	comes	to	building	new	habits	you	can	use	the

connectedness	of	behavior	to	your	advantage	one	of	the	best	ways	to
build	a	new	habit	is	to	identify	a	current	habit	you	already	do	each	day
and	then	stack	your	new	behavior	on	top	this	is	called	habit	stacking

habit	stacking	is	a	special	form	of	an	implementation	intention
rather	than	pairing	your	new	habit	with	a	particular	time	and	location
you	pair	it	with	a	current	habit	this	method	which	was	created	by	bj
fogg	as	part	of	his	tiny	habits	program	can	be	used	to	design	an
obvious	cue	for	nearly	any	habit

the	habit	stacking	formula	is

after	current	habit	i	will	new	habit

for	example

meditation	after	i	pour	my	cup	of	coffee	each	morning	i	will
meditate	for	one	minute

exercise	after	i	take	off	my	work	shoes	i	will	immediately
change	into	my	workout	clothes

gratitude	after	i	sit	down	to	dinner	i	will	say	one	thing	i am
grateful	for	that	happened	today

marriage	after	i	get	into	bed	at	night	i	will	give	my	partner	a
kiss

safety	after	i	put	on	my	running	shoes	i	will	text	a	friend	or
family	member	where	i	am	running	and	how	long	it	will	take

the	key	is	to	tie	your	desired	behavior	into	something	you	already

do	each	day	once	you	have	mastered	this	basic	structure	you	can
begin	to	create	larger	stacks	by	chaining	small	habits	together	this
allows	you	to	take	advantage	of	the	natural	momentum	that	comes
from	one	behavior	leading	into	the	nexta	positive	version	of	the
diderot	effect

habit	stacking

figure	7	habit	stacking	increases	the	likelihood	that	you will	stick	with	a
habit	by	stacking	your	new	behavior	on	top	of	an	old	one	this	process	can
be	repeated	to	chain	numerous	habits	together	each	one	acting	as	the	cue
for	the	next

your	morning	routine	habit	stack	might	look	like	this

1	 after	i	pour	my	morning	cup	of	coffee	i	will	meditate	for	sixty

seconds

2	 after	i	meditate	for	sixty	seconds	i	will	write	my	todo	list	for

the	day

3	 after	i	write	my	todo	list	for	the	day	i	will	immediately	begin

my	first	task

or	consider	this	habit	stack	in	the	evening

1	 after	i	finish	eating	dinner	i	will	put	my	plate	directly	into	the

dishwasher

2	 after	i	put	my	dishes	away	i	will	immediately	wipe	down	the

counter

3	 after	i	wipe	down	the	counter	i	will	set	out	my	coffee	mug	for

tomorrow	morning

you	can	also	insert	new	behaviors	into	the	middle	of	your	current
routines	for	example	you	may	already	have	a	morning	routine	that
looks	like	this	wake	up		make	my	bed		take	a	shower	let us	say	you
want	to	develop	the	habit	of	reading	more	each	night	you	can	expand
your	habit	stack	and	try	something	like	wake	up		make	my	bed	
place	a	book	on	my	pillow		take	a	shower	now	when	you	climb	into
bed	each	night	a	book	will	be	sitting	there	waiting	for	you	to	enjoy

overall	habit	stacking	allows	you	to	create	a	set	of	simple	rules	that

guide	your	future	behavior	its	like	you	always	have	a	game	plan	for
which	action	should	come	next	once	you	get	comfortable	with	this
approach	you	can	develop	general	habit	stacks	to	guide	you	whenever
the	situation	is	appropriate

exercise	when	i	see	a	set	of	stairs	i	will	take	them	instead	of
using	the	elevator

social	skills	when	i	walk	into	a	party	i	will	introduce	myself	to
someone	i	do not	know	yet

finances	when	i	want	to	buy	something	over	100	i	will	wait
twentyfour	hours	before	purchasing

healthy	eating	when	i	serve	myself	a	meal	i	will	always	put
veggies	on	my	plate	first

minimalism	when	i	buy	a	new	item	i	will	give	something	away
one	in	one	out

mood	when	the	phone	rings	i	will	take	one	deep	breath	and
smile	before	answering

forgetfulness	when	i	leave	a	public	place	i	will	check	the	table
and	chairs	to	make	sure	i	do not	leave	anything	behind

no	matter	how	you	use	this	strategy	the	secret	to	creating	a
successful	habit	stack	is	selecting	the	right	cue	to	kick	things	off
unlike	an	implementation	intention	which	specifically	states	the	time
and	location	for	a	given	behavior	habit	stacking	implicitly	has	the	time
and	location	built	into	it	when	and	where	you	choose	to	insert	a	habit
into	your	daily	routine	can	make	a	big	difference	if	you are	trying	to
add	meditation	into	your	morning	routine	but	mornings	are	chaotic
and	your	kids	keep	running	into	the	room	then	that	may	be	the	wrong
place	and	time	consider	when	you	are	most	likely	to	be	successful
do not	ask	yourself	to	do	a	habit	when	you are	likely	to	be	occupied	with
something	else

your	cue	should	also	have	the	same	frequency	as	your	desired	habit

if	you	want	to	do	a	habit	every	day	but	you	stack	it	on	top	of	a	habit
that	only	happens	on	mondays	that is	not	a	good	choice

one	way	to	find	the	right	trigger	for	your	habit	stack	is	by

brainstorming	a	list	of	your	current	habits	you	can	use	your	habits
scorecard	from	the	last	chapter	as	a	starting	point	alternatively	you
can	create	a	list	with	two	columns	in	the	first	column	write	down	the
habits	you	do	each	day	without	fail

for	example

get	out	of	bed

take	a	shower

brush	your	teeth

get	dressed

brew	a	cup	of	coffee

eat	breakfast

take	the	kids	to	school

start	the	work	day

eat	lunch

end	the	work	day

change	out	of	work	clothes

sit	down	for	dinner

turn	off	the	lights

get	into	bed

your	list	can	be	much	longer	but	you	get	the	idea	in	the	second

column	write	down	all	of	the	things	that	happen	to	you	each	day
without	fail	for	example

the	sun	rises

you	get	a	text	message

the	song	you	are	listening	to	ends

the	sun	sets

armed	with	these	two	lists	you	can	begin	searching	for	the	best

place	to	layer	your	new	habit	into	your	lifestyle

habit	stacking	works	best	when	the	cue	is	highly	specific	and

immediately	actionable	many	people	select	cues	that	are	too	vague	i
made	this	mistake	myself	when	i	wanted	to	start	a	pushup	habit	my
habit	stack	was	when	i	take	a	break	for	lunch	i	will	do	ten	pushups
at	first	glance	this	sounded	reasonable	but	soon	i	realized	the	trigger
was	unclear	would	i	do	my	pushups	before	i	ate	lunch	after	i	ate
lunch	where	would	i	do	them	after	a	few	inconsistent	days	i
changed	my	habit	stack	to	when	i	close	my	laptop	for	lunch	i	will	do
ten	pushups	next	to	my	desk	ambiguity	gone

habits	like	read	more	or	eat	better	are	worthy	causes	but	these

goals	do	not	provide	instruction	on	how	and	when	to	act	be	specific
and	clear	after	i	close	the	door	after	i	brush	my	teeth	after	i	sit
down	at	the	table	the	specificity	is	important	the	more	tightly	bound
your	new	habit	is	to	a	specific	cue	the	better	the	odds	are	that	you	will
notice	when	the	time	comes	to	act

the	1st	law	of	behavior	change	is	to	make	it	obvious	strategies
like	implementation	intentions	and	habit	stacking	are	among	the	most
practical	ways	to	create	obvious	cues	for	your	habits	and	design	a	clear
plan	for	when	and	where	to	take	action

chapter	summary

the	1st	law	of	behavior	change	is	make	it	obvious

the	two	most	common	cues	are	time	and	location

creating	an	implementation	intention	is	a	strategy	you	can	use	to
pair	a	new	habit	with	a	specific	time	and	location

the	implementation	intention	formula	is	i	will	behavior	at
time	in	location

habit	stacking	is	a	strategy	you	can	use	to	pair	a	new	habit	with	a
current	habit

the	habit	stacking	formula	is	after	current	habit	i	will
new	habit

motivation	is	overrated	environment
often	matters	more

anne	thorndike	a	primary	care	physician	at	massachusetts	general
hospital	in	boston	had	a	crazy	idea	she	believed	she	could	improve
the	eating	habits	of	thousands	of	hospital	staff	and	visitors	without
changing	their	willpower	or	motivation	in	the	slightest	way	in	fact	she
did not	plan	on	talking	to	them	at	all

thorndike	and	her	colleagues	designed	a	sixmonth	study	to	alter

the	choice	architecture	of	the	hospital	cafeteria	they	started	by
changing	how	drinks	were	arranged	in	the	room	originally	the
refrigerators	located	next	to	the	cash	registers	in	the	cafeteria	were
filled	with	only	soda	the	researchers	added	water	as	an	option	to	each
one	additionally	they	placed	baskets	of	bottled	water	next	to	the	food
stations	throughout	the	room	soda	was	still	in	the	primary
refrigerators	but	water	was	now	available	at	all	drink	locations

over	the	next	three	months	the	number	of	soda	sales	at	the	hospital

dropped	by	114	percent	meanwhile	sales	of	bottled	water	increased
by	258	percent	they	made	similar	adjustmentsand	saw	similar
resultswith	the	food	in	the	cafeteria	nobody	had	said	a	word	to
anyone	eating	there

before

after

figure	8	here	is	a	representation	of	what	the	cafeteria	looked	like	before
the	environment	design	changes	were	made	left	and	after	right	the
shaded	boxes	indicate	areas	where	bottled	water	was	available	in	each
instance	because	the	amount	of	water	in	the	environment	was	increased
behavior	shifted	naturally	and	without	additional	motivation

people	often	choose	products	not	because	of	what	they	are	but
because	of	where	they	are	if	i	walk	into	the	kitchen	and	see	a	plate	of
cookies	on	the	counter	ill	pick	up	half	a	dozen	and	start	eating	even	if
i	had not	been	thinking	about	them	beforehand	and	did not	necessarily
feel	hungry	if	the	communal	table	at	the	office	is	always	filled	with
doughnuts	and	bagels	its	going	to	be	hard	not	to	grab	one	every	now
and	then	your	habits	change	depending	on	the	room	you	are	in	and
the	cues	in	front	of	you

environment	is	the	invisible	hand	that	shapes	human	behavior
despite	our	unique	personalities	certain	behaviors	tend	to	arise	again
and	again	under	certain	environmental	conditions	in	church	people
tend	to	talk	in	whispers	on	a	dark	street	people	act	wary	and	guarded
in	this	way	the	most	common	form	of	change	is	not	internal	but
external	we	are	changed	by	the	world	around	us	every	habit	is
context	dependent

in	1936	psychologist	kurt	lewin	wrote	a	simple	equation	that
makes	a	powerful	statement	behavior	is	a	function	of	the	person	in
their	environment	or	b		f	pe

it	did not	take	long	for	lewins	equation	to	be	tested	in	business	in
1952	the	economist	hawkins	stern	described	a	phenomenon	he	called
suggestion	impulse	buying	which	is	triggered	when	a	shopper	sees	a
product	for	the	first	time	and	visualizes	a	need	for	it	in	other	words
customers	will	occasionally	buy	products	not	because	they	want	them
but	because	of	how	they	are	presented	to	them

for	example	items	at	eye	level	tend	to	be	purchased	more	than
those	down	near	the	floor	for	this	reason	you will	find	expensive	brand
names	featured	in	easytoreach	locations	on	store	shelves	because
they	drive	the	most	profit	while	cheaper	alternatives	are	tucked	away
in	hardertoreach	spots	the	same	goes	for	end	caps	which	are	the
units	at	the	end	of	aisles	end	caps	are	moneymaking	machines	for
retailers	because	they	are	obvious	locations	that	encounter	a	lot	of	foot
traffic	for	example	45	percent	of	cocacola	sales	come	specifically
from	endoftheaisle	racks

the	more	obviously	available	a	product	or	service	is	the	more	likely

you	are	to	try	it	people	drink	bud	light	because	it	is	in	every	bar	and
visit	starbucks	because	it	is	on	every	corner	we	like	to	think	that	we
are	in	control	if	we	choose	water	over	soda	we	assume	it	is	because
we	wanted	to	do	so	the	truth	however	is	that	many	of	the	actions	we
take	each	day	are	shaped	not	by	purposeful	drive	and	choice	but	by	the
most	obvious	option

every	living	being	has	its	own	methods	for	sensing	and

understanding	the	world	eagles	have	remarkable	longdistance	vision
snakes	can	smell	by	tasting	the	air	with	their	highly	sensitive
tongues	sharks	can	detect	small	amounts	of	electricity	and	vibrations
in	the	water	caused	by	nearby	fish	even	bacteria	have	chemoreceptors
tiny	sensory	cells	that	allow	them	to	detect	toxic	chemicals	in	their
environment

in	humans	perception	is	directed	by	the	sensory	nervous	system
we	perceive	the	world	through	sight	sound	smell	touch	and	taste
but	we	also	have	other	ways	of	sensing	stimuli	some	are	conscious
but	many	are	nonconscious	for	instance	you	can	notice	when	the
temperature	drops	before	a	storm	or	when	the	pain	in	your	gut	rises
during	a	stomachache	or	when	you	fall	off	balance	while	walking	on
rocky	ground	receptors	in	your	body	pick	up	on	a	wide	range	of
internal	stimuli	such	as	the	amount	of	salt	in	your	blood	or	the	need	to
drink	when	thirsty

the	most	powerful	of	all	human	sensory	abilities	however	is	vision

the	human	body	has	about	eleven	million	sensory	receptors
approximately	ten	million	of	those	are	dedicated	to	sight	some
experts	estimate	that	half	of	the	brains	resources	are	used	on	vision
given	that	we	are	more	dependent	on	vision	than	on	any	other	sense	it
should	come	as	no	surprise	that	visual	cues	are	the	greatest	catalyst	of
our	behavior	for	this	reason	a	small	change	in	what	you	see	can	lead
to	a	big	shift	in	what	you	do	as	a	result	you	can	imagine	how
important	it	is	to	live	and	work	in	environments	that	are	filled	with
productive	cues	and	devoid	of	unproductive	ones

thankfully	there	is	good	news	in	this	respect	you	do not	have	to	be

the	victim	of	your	environment	you	can	also	be	the	architect	of	it

how	to	design	your	environment	for	success

during	the	energy	crisis	and	oil	embargo	of	the	1970s	dutch
researchers	began	to	pay	close	attention	to	the	countrys	energy	usage
in	one	suburb	near	amsterdam	they	found	that	some	homeowners
used	30	percent	less	energy	than	their	neighborsdespite	the	homes
being	of	similar	size	and	getting	electricity	for	the	same	price

it	turned	out	the	houses	in	this	neighborhood	were	nearly	identical

except	for	one	feature	the	location	of	the	electrical	meter	some	had
one	in	the	basement	others	had	the	electrical	meter	upstairs	in	the
main	hallway	as	you	may	guess	the	homes	with	the	meters	located	in
the	main	hallway	used	less	electricity	when	their	energy	use	was
obvious	and	easy	to	track	people	changed	their	behavior

every	habit	is	initiated	by	a	cue	and	we	are	more	likely	to	notice
cues	that	stand	out	unfortunately	the	environments	where	we	live
and	work	often	make	it	easy	not	to	do	certain	actions	because	there	is
no	obvious	cue	to	trigger	the	behavior	its	easy	not	to	practice	the
guitar	when	its	tucked	away	in	the	closet	its	easy	not	to	read	a	book
when	the	bookshelf	is	in	the	corner	of	the	guest	room	its	easy	not	to
take	your	vitamins	when	they	are	out	of	sight	in	the	pantry	when	the
cues	that	spark	a	habit	are	subtle	or	hidden	they	are	easy	to	ignore

by	comparison	creating	obvious	visual	cues	can	draw	your

attention	toward	a	desired	habit	in	the	early	1990s	the	cleaning	staff
at	schiphol	airport	in	amsterdam	installed	a	small	sticker	that	looked
like	a	fly	near	the	center	of	each	urinal	apparently	when	men	stepped

up	to	the	urinals	they	aimed	for	what	they	thought	was	a	bug	the
stickers	improved	their	aim	and	significantly	reduced	spillage	around
the	urinals	further	analysis	determined	that	the	stickers	cut	bathroom
cleaning	costs	by	8	percent	per	year

i have	experienced	the	power	of	obvious	cues	in	my	own	life	i	used	to
buy	apples	from	the	store	put	them	in	the	crisper	in	the	bottom	of	the
refrigerator	and	forget	all	about	them	by	the	time	i	remembered	the
apples	would	have	gone	bad	i	never	saw	them	so	i	never	ate	them

eventually	i	took	my	own	advice	and	redesigned	my	environment	i

bought	a	large	display	bowl	and	placed	it	in	the	middle	of	the	kitchen
counter	the	next	time	i	bought	apples	that	was	where	they	wentout
in	the	open	where	i	could	see	them	almost	like	magic	i	began	eating	a
few	apples	each	day	simply	because	they	were	obvious	rather	than	out
of	sight

here	are	a	few	ways	you	can	redesign	your	environment	and	make

the	cues	for	your	preferred	habits	more	obvious

if	you	want	to	remember	to	take	your	medication	each	night	put
your	pill	bottle	directly	next	to	the	faucet	on	the	bathroom
counter

if	you	want	to	practice	guitar	more	frequently	place	your	guitar
stand	in	the	middle	of	the	living	room

if	you	want	to	remember	to	send	more	thankyou	notes	keep	a
stack	of	stationery	on	your	desk

if	you	want	to	drink	more	water	fill	up	a	few	water	bottles	each
morning	and	place	them	in	common	locations	around	the	house

if	you	want	to	make	a	habit	a	big	part	of	your	life	make	the	cue	a	big

part	of	your	environment	the	most	persistent	behaviors	usually	have
multiple	cues	consider	how	many	different	ways	a	smoker	could	be
prompted	to	pull	out	a	cigarette	driving	in	the	car	seeing	a	friend
smoke	feeling	stressed	at	work	and	so	on

the	same	strategy	can	be	employed	for	good	habits	by	sprinkling

triggers	throughout	your	surroundings	you	increase	the	odds	that
you will	think	about	your	habit	throughout	the	day	make	sure	the	best
choice	is	the	most	obvious	one	making	a	better	decision	is	easy	and
natural	when	the	cues	for	good	habits	are	right	in	front	of	you

environment	design	is	powerful	not	only	because	it	influences	how
we	engage	with	the	world	but	also	because	we	rarely	do	it	most	people
live	in	a	world	others	have	created	for	them	but	you	can	alter	the
spaces	where	you	live	and	work	to	increase	your	exposure	to	positive
cues	and	reduce	your	exposure	to	negative	ones	environment	design
allows	you	to	take	back	control	and	become	the	architect	of	your	life
be	the	designer	of	your	world	and	not	merely	the	consumer	of	it

the	context	is	the	cue

the	cues	that	trigger	a	habit	can	start	out	very	specific	but	over	time
your	habits	become	associated	not	with	a	single	trigger	but	with	the
entire	context	surrounding	the	behavior

for	example	many	people	drink	more	in	social	situations	than	they
would	ever	drink	alone	the	trigger	is	rarely	a	single	cue	but	rather	the
whole	situation	watching	your	friends	order	drinks	hearing	the	music
at	the	bar	seeing	the	beers	on	tap

we	mentally	assign	our	habits	to	the	locations	in	which	they	occur
the	home	the	office	the	gym	each	location	develops	a	connection	to
certain	habits	and	routines	you	establish	a	particular	relationship	with
the	objects	on	your	desk	the	items	on	your	kitchen	counter	the	things
in	your	bedroom

our	behavior	is	not	defined	by	the	objects	in	the	environment	but	by
our	relationship	to	them	in	fact	this	is	a	useful	way	to	think	about	the
influence	of	the	environment	on	your	behavior	stop	thinking	about
your	environment	as	filled	with	objects	start	thinking	about	it	as	filled
with	relationships	think	in	terms	of	how	you	interact	with	the	spaces
around	you	for	one	person	her	couch	is	the	place	where	she	reads	for
an	hour	each	night	for	someone	else	the	couch	is	where	he	watches
television	and	eats	a	bowl	of	ice	cream	after	work	different	people	can
have	different	memoriesand	thus	different	habitsassociated	with
the	same	place

the	good	news	you	can	train	yourself	to	link	a	particular	habit	with

a	particular	context

in	one	study	scientists	instructed	insomniacs	to	get	into	bed	only
when	they	were	tired	if	they	could not	fall	asleep	they	were	told	to	sit
in	a	different	room	until	they	became	sleepy	over	time	subjects	began

to	associate	the	context	of	their	bed	with	the	action	of	sleeping	and	it
became	easier	to	quickly	fall	asleep	when	they	climbed	in	bed	their
brains	learned	that	sleepingnot	browsing	on	their	phones	not
watching	television	not	staring	at	the	clockwas	the	only	action	that
happened	in	that	room

the	power	of	context	also	reveals	an	important	strategy	habits	can
be	easier	to	change	in	a	new	environment	it	helps	to	escape	the	subtle
triggers	and	cues	that	nudge	you	toward	your	current	habits	go	to	a
new	placea	different	coffee	shop	a	bench	in	the	park	a	corner	of
your	room	you	seldom	useand	create	a	new	routine	there

it	is	easier	to	associate	a	new	habit	with	a	new	context	than	to	build

a	new	habit	in	the	face	of	competing	cues	it	can	be	difficult	to	go	to
bed	early	if	you	watch	television	in	your	bedroom	each	night	it	can	be
hard	to	study	in	the	living	room	without	getting	distracted	if	that is
where	you	always	play	video	games	but	when	you	step	outside	your
normal	environment	you	leave	your	behavioral	biases	behind	you
are not	battling	old	environmental	cues	which	allows	new	habits	to
form	without	interruption

want	to	think	more	creatively	move	to	a	bigger	room	a	rooftop
patio	or	a	building	with	expansive	architecture	take	a	break	from	the
space	where	you	do	your	daily	work	which	is	also	linked	to	your
current	thought	patterns

trying	to	eat	healthier	it	is	likely	that	you	shop	on	autopilot	at	your
regular	supermarket	try	a	new	grocery	store	you	may	find	it	easier	to
avoid	unhealthy	food	when	your	brain	does not	automatically	know
where	it	is	located	in	the	store

when	you	cannot	manage	to	get	to	an	entirely	new	environment
redefine	or	rearrange	your	current	one	create	a	separate	space	for
work	study	exercise	entertainment	and	cooking	the	mantra	i	find
useful	is	one	space	one	use

when	i	started	my	career	as	an	entrepreneur	i	would	often	work
from	my	couch	or	at	the	kitchen	table	in	the	evenings	i	found	it	very
difficult	to	stop	working	there	was	no	clear	division	between	the	end
of	work	time	and	the	beginning	of	personal	time	was	the	kitchen	table
my	office	or	the	space	where	i	ate	meals	was	the	couch	where	i
relaxed	or	where	i	sent	emails	everything	happened	in	the	same
place

a	few	years	later	i	could	finally	afford	to	move	to	a	home	with	a

separate	room	for	my	office	suddenly	work	was	something	that
happened	in	here	and	personal	life	was	something	that	happened
out	there	it	was	easier	for	me	to	turn	off	the	professional	side	of	my
brain	when	there	was	a	clear	dividing	line	between	work	life	and	home
life	each	room	had	one	primary	use	the	kitchen	was	for	cooking	the
office	was	for	working

whenever	possible	avoid	mixing	the	context	of	one	habit	with
another	when	you	start	mixing	contexts	you will	start	mixing	habits
and	the	easier	ones	will	usually	win	out	this	is	one	reason	why	the
versatility	of	modern	technology	is	both	a	strength	and	a	weakness
you	can	use	your	phone	for	all	sorts	of	tasks	which	makes	it	a
powerful	device	but	when	you	can	use	your	phone	to	do	nearly
anything	it	becomes	hard	to	associate	it	with	one	task	you	want	to	be
productive	but	you are	also	conditioned	to	browse	social	media	check
email	and	play	video	games	whenever	you	open	your	phone	its	a
mishmash	of	cues

you	may	be	thinking	you	do not	understand	i	live	in	new	york
city	my	apartment	is	the	size	of	a	smartphone	i	need	each	room	to
play	multiple	roles	fair	enough	if	your	space	is	limited	divide	your
room	into	activity	zones	a	chair	for	reading	a	desk	for	writing	a	table
for	eating	you	can	do	the	same	with	your	digital	spaces	i	know	a
writer	who	uses	his	computer	only	for	writing	his	tablet	only	for
reading	and	his	phone	only	for	social	media	and	texting	every	habit
should	have	a	home

if	you	can	manage	to	stick	with	this	strategy	each	context	will

become	associated	with	a	particular	habit	and	mode	of	thought	habits
thrive	under	predictable	circumstances	like	these	focus	comes
automatically	when	you	are	sitting	at	your	work	desk	relaxation	is
easier	when	you	are	in	a	space	designed	for	that	purpose	sleep	comes
quickly	when	it	is	the	only	thing	that	happens	in	your	bedroom	if	you
want	behaviors	that	are	stable	and	predictable	you	need	an
environment	that	is	stable	and	predictable

a	stable	environment	where	everything	has	a	place	and	a	purpose	is

an	environment	where	habits	can	easily	form

chapter	summary

small	changes	in	context	can	lead	to	large	changes	in	behavior
over	time

every	habit	is	initiated	by	a	cue	we	are	more	likely	to	notice	cues
that	stand	out

make	the	cues	of	good	habits	obvious	in	your	environment

gradually	your	habits	become	associated	not	with	a	single	trigger
but	with	the	entire	context	surrounding	the	behavior	the	context
becomes	the	cue

it	is	easier	to	build	new	habits	in	a	new	environment	because	you
are	not	fighting	against	old	cues

the	secret	to	selfcontrol

i

n	1971	as	the	vietnam	war	was	heading	into	its	sixteenth	year
congressmen	robert	steele	from	connecticut	and	morgan	murphy

from	illinois	made	a	discovery	that	stunned	the	american	public
while	visiting	the	troops	they	had	learned	that	over	15	percent	of	us
soldiers	stationed	there	were	heroin	addicts	followup	research
revealed	that	35	percent	of	service	members	in	vietnam	had	tried
heroin	and	as	many	as	20	percent	were	addictedthe	problem	was
even	worse	than	they	had	initially	thought

the	discovery	led	to	a	flurry	of	activity	in	washington	including	the

creation	of	the	special	action	office	of	drug	abuse	prevention	under
president	nixon	to	promote	prevention	and	rehabilitation	and	to	track
addicted	service	members	when	they	returned	home

lee	robins	was	one	of	the	researchers	in	charge	in	a	finding	that

completely	upended	the	accepted	beliefs	about	addiction	robins
found	that	when	soldiers	who	had	been	heroin	users	returned	home
only	5	percent	of	them	became	readdicted	within	a	year	and	just	12
percent	relapsed	within	three	years	in	other	words	approximately
nine	out	of	ten	soldiers	who	used	heroin	in	vietnam	eliminated	their
addiction	nearly	overnight

this	finding	contradicted	the	prevailing	view	at	the	time	which

considered	heroin	addiction	to	be	a	permanent	and	irreversible
condition	instead	robins	revealed	that	addictions	could
spontaneously	dissolve	if	there	was	a	radical	change	in	the
environment	in	vietnam	soldiers	spent	all	day	surrounded	by	cues
triggering	heroin	use	it	was	easy	to	access	they	were	engulfed	by	the
constant	stress	of	war	they	built	friendships	with	fellow	soldiers	who

were	also	heroin	users	and	they	were	thousands	of	miles	from	home
once	a	soldier	returned	to	the	united	states	though	he	found	himself
in	an	environment	devoid	of	those	triggers	when	the	context	changed
so	did	the	habit

compare	this	situation	to	that	of	a	typical	drug	user	someone
becomes	addicted	at	home	or	with	friends	goes	to	a	clinic	to	get	clean
which	is	devoid	of	all	the	environmental	stimuli	that	prompt	their
habitthen	returns	to	their	old	neighborhood	with	all	of	their	previous
cues	that	caused	them	to	get	addicted	in	the	first	place	its	no	wonder
that	usually	you	see	numbers	that	are	the	exact	opposite	of	those	in	the
vietnam	study	typically	90	percent	of	heroin	users	become	re
addicted	once	they	return	home	from	rehab

the	vietnam	studies	ran	counter	to	many	of	our	cultural	beliefs
about	bad	habits	because	it	challenged	the	conventional	association	of
unhealthy	behavior	as	a	moral	weakness	if	you are	overweight	a
smoker	or	an	addict	you have	been	told	your	entire	life	that	it	is	because
you	lack	selfcontrolmaybe	even	that	you are	a	bad	person	the	idea
that	a	little	bit	of	discipline	would	solve	all	our	problems	is	deeply
embedded	in	our	culture

recent	research	however	shows	something	different	when

scientists	analyze	people	who	appear	to	have	tremendous	selfcontrol
it	turns	out	those	individuals	are not	all	that	different	from	those	who
are	struggling	instead	disciplined	people	are	better	at	structuring
their	lives	in	a	way	that	does	not	require	heroic	willpower	and	self
control	in	other	words	they	spend	less	time	in	tempting	situations

the	people	with	the	best	selfcontrol	are	typically	the	ones	who	need

to	use	it	the	least	its	easier	to	practice	selfrestraint	when	you	do not
have	to	use	it	very	often	so	yes	perseverance	grit	and	willpower	are
essential	to	success	but	the	way	to	improve	these	qualities	is	not	by
wishing	you	were	a	more	disciplined	person	but	by	creating	a	more
disciplined	environment

this	counterintuitive	idea	makes	even	more	sense	once	you

understand	what	happens	when	a	habit	is	formed	in	the	brain	a	habit
that	has	been	encoded	in	the	mind	is	ready	to	be	used	whenever	the
relevant	situation	arises	when	patty	olwell	a	therapist	from	austin
texas	started	smoking	she	would	often	light	up	while	riding	horses
with	a	friend	eventually	she	quit	smoking	and	avoided	it	for	years
she	had	also	stopped	riding	decades	later	she	hopped	on	a	horse

again	and	found	herself	craving	a	cigarette	for	the	first	time	in	forever
the	cues	were	still	internalized	she	just	had not	been	exposed	to	them
in	a	long	time

once	a	habit	has	been	encoded	the	urge	to	act	follows	whenever	the

environmental	cues	reappear	this	is	one	reason	behavior	change
techniques	can	backfire	shaming	obese	people	with	weightloss
presentations	can	make	them	feel	stressed	and	as	a	result	many
people	return	to	their	favorite	coping	strategy	overeating	showing
pictures	of	blackened	lungs	to	smokers	leads	to	higher	levels	of
anxiety	which	drives	many	people	to	reach	for	a	cigarette	if	you are	not
careful	about	cues	you	can	because	the	very	behavior	you	want	to	stop

bad	habits	are	autocatalytic	the	process	feeds	itself	they	foster	the

feelings	they	try	to	numb	you	feel	bad	so	you	eat	junk	food	because
you	eat	junk	food	you	feel	bad	watching	television	makes	you	feel
sluggish	so	you	watch	more	television	because	you	do not	have	the
energy	to	do	anything	else	worrying	about	your	health	makes	you	feel
anxious	which	causes	you	to	smoke	to	ease	your	anxiety	which	makes
your	health	even	worse	and	soon	you are	feeling	more	anxious	its	a
downward	spiral	a	runaway	train	of	bad	habits

researchers	refer	to	this	phenomenon	as	cueinduced	wanting	an

external	trigger	causes	a	compulsive	craving	to	repeat	a	bad	habit
once	you	notice	something	you	begin	to	want	it	this	process	is
happening	all	the	timeoften	without	us	realizing	it	scientists	have
found	that	showing	addicts	a	picture	of	cocaine	for	just	thirtythree
milliseconds	stimulates	the	reward	pathway	in	the	brain	and	sparks
desire	this	speed	is	too	fast	for	the	brain	to	consciously	registerthe
addicts	could not	even	tell	you	what	they	had	seenbut	they	craved	the
drug	all	the	same

here is	the	punch	line	you	can	break	a	habit	but	you are	unlikely	to
forget	it	once	the	mental	grooves	of	habit	have	been	carved	into	your
brain	they	are	nearly	impossible	to	remove	entirelyeven	if	they	go
unused	for	quite	a	while	and	that	means	that	simply	resisting
temptation	is	an	ineffective	strategy	it	is	hard	to	maintain	a	zen
attitude	in	a	life	filled	with	interruptions	it	takes	too	much	energy	in
the	shortrun	you	can	choose	to	overpower	temptation	in	the	long
run	we	become	a	product	of	the	environment	that	we	live	in	to	put	it
bluntly	i	have	never	seen	someone	consistently	stick	to	positive	habits
in	a	negative	environment

a	more	reliable	approach	is	to	cut	bad	habits	off	at	the	source	one

of	the	most	practical	ways	to	eliminate	a	bad	habit	is	to	reduce
exposure	to	the	cue	that	causes	it

if	you	cannot	seem	to	get	any	work	done	leave	your	phone	in
another	room	for	a	few	hours

if	you are	continually	feeling	like	you are	not	enough	stop	following
social	media	accounts	that	trigger	jealousy	and	envy

if	you are	wasting	too	much	time	watching	television	move	the	tv
out	of	the	bedroom

if	you are	spending	too	much	money	on	electronics	quit	reading
reviews	of	the	latest	tech	gear

if	you are	playing	too	many	video	games	unplug	the	console	and
put	it	in	a	closet	after	each	use

this	practice	is	an	inversion	of	the	1st	law	of	behavior	change
rather	than	make	it	obvious	you	can	make	it	invisible	i am	often
surprised	by	how	effective	simple	changes	like	these	can	be	remove	a
single	cue	and	the	entire	habit	often	fades	away

selfcontrol	is	a	shortterm	strategy	not	a	longterm	one	you	may

be	able	to	resist	temptation	once	or	twice	but	its	unlikely	you	can
muster	the	willpower	to	override	your	desires	every	time	instead	of
summoning	a	new	dose	of	willpower	whenever	you	want	to	do	the	right
thing	your	energy	would	be	better	spent	optimizing	your	environment
this	is	the	secret	to	selfcontrol	make	the	cues	of	your	good	habits

how	to	make	a	habit	irresistible

i

n	the	1940s	a	dutch	scientist	named	niko	tinbergen	performed	a
series	of	experiments	that	transformed	our	understanding	of	what

motivates	us	tinbergenwho	eventually	won	a	nobel	prize	for	his
workwas	investigating	herring	gulls	the	gray	and	white	birds	often
seen	flying	along	the	seashores	of	north	america

adult	herring	gulls	have	a	small	red	dot	on	their	beak	and
tinbergen	noticed	that	newly	hatched	chicks	would	peck	this	spot
whenever	they	wanted	food	to	begin	one	experiment	he	created	a
collection	of	fake	cardboard	beaks	just	a	head	without	a	body	when
the	parents	had	flown	away	he	went	over	to	the	nest	and	offered	these
dummy	beaks	to	the	chicks	the	beaks	were	obvious	fakes	and	he
assumed	the	baby	birds	would	reject	them	altogether

however	when	the	tiny	gulls	saw	the	red	spot	on	the	cardboard
beak	they	pecked	away	just	as	if	it	were	attached	to	their	own	mother
they	had	a	clear	preference	for	those	red	spotsas	if	they	had	been
genetically	programmed	at	birth	soon	tinbergen	discovered	that	the
bigger	the	red	spot	the	faster	the	chicks	pecked	eventually	he	created
a	beak	with	three	large	red	dots	on	it	when	he	placed	it	over	the	nest
the	baby	birds	went	crazy	with	delight	they	pecked	at	the	little	red
patches	as	if	it	was	the	greatest	beak	they	had	ever	seen

tinbergen	and	his	colleagues	discovered	similar	behavior	in	other

animals	for	example	the	greylag	goose	is	a	groundnesting	bird
occasionally	as	the	mother	moves	around	on	the	nest	one	of	the	eggs
will	roll	out	and	settle	on	the	grass	nearby	whenever	this	happens	the
goose	will	waddle	over	to	the	egg	and	use	its	beak	and	neck	to	pull	it
back	into	the	nest

tinbergen	discovered	that	the	goose	will	pull	any	nearby	round
object	such	as	a	billiard	ball	or	a	lightbulb	back	into	the	nest	the
bigger	the	object	the	greater	their	response	one	goose	even	made	a
tremendous	effort	to	roll	a	volleyball	back	and	sit	on	top	like	the	baby
gulls	automatically	pecking	at	red	dots	the	greylag	goose	was	following
an	instinctive	rule	when	i	see	a	round	object	nearby	i	must	roll	it
back	into	the	nest	the	bigger	the	round	object	the	harder	i	should	try
to	get	it

its	like	the	brain	of	each	animal	is	preloaded	with	certain	rules	for
behavior	and	when	it	comes	across	an	exaggerated	version	of	that	rule
it	lights	up	like	a	christmas	tree	scientists	refer	to	these	exaggerated
cues	as	supernormal	stimuli	a	supernormal	stimulus	is	a	heightened
version	of	realitylike	a	beak	with	three	red	dots	or	an	egg	the	size	of	a
volleyballand	it	elicits	a	stronger	response	than	usual

humans	are	also	prone	to	fall	for	exaggerated	versions	of	reality
junk	food	for	example	drives	our	reward	systems	into	a	frenzy	after
spending	hundreds	of	thousands	of	years	hunting	and	foraging	for
food	in	the	wild	the	human	brain	has	evolved	to	place	a	high	value	on
salt	sugar	and	fat	such	foods	are	often	caloriedense	and	they	were
quite	rare	when	our	ancient	ancestors	were	roaming	the	savannah
when	you	do not	know	where	your	next	meal	is	coming	from	eating	as
much	as	possible	is	an	excellent	strategy	for	survival

today	however	we	live	in	a	calorierich	environment	food	is
abundant	but	your	brain	continues	to	crave	it	like	it	is	scarce	placing
a	high	value	on	salt	sugar	and	fat	is	no	longer	advantageous	to	our
health	but	the	craving	persists	because	the	brains	reward	centers	have
not	changed	for	approximately	fifty	thousand	years	the	modern	food
industry	relies	on	stretching	our	paleolithic	instincts	beyond	their
evolutionary	purpose

a	primary	goal	of	food	science	is	to	create	products	that	are	more

attractive	to	consumers	nearly	every	food	in	a	bag	box	or	jar	has
been	enhanced	in	some	way	if	only	with	additional	flavoring
companies	spend	millions	of	dollars	to	discover	the	most	satisfying
level	of	crunch	in	a	potato	chip	or	the	perfect	amount	of	fizz	in	a	soda
entire	departments	are	dedicated	to	optimizing	how	a	product	feels	in
your	moutha	quality	known	as	orosensation	french	fries	for
example	are	a	potent	combinationgolden	brown	and	crunchy	on	the
outside	light	and	smooth	on	the	inside

other	processed	foods	enhance	dynamic	contrast	which	refers	to

items	with	a	combination	of	sensations	like	crunchy	and	creamy
imagine	the	gooeyness	of	melted	cheese	on	top	of	a	crispy	pizza	crust
or	the	crunch	of	an	oreo	cookie	combined	with	its	smooth	center	with
natural	unprocessed	foods	you	tend	to	experience	the	same
sensations	over	and	overhows	that	seventeenth	bite	of	kale	taste
after	a	few	minutes	your	brain	loses	interest	and	you	begin	to	feel	full
but	foods	that	are	high	in	dynamic	contrast	keep	the	experience	novel
and	interesting	encouraging	you	to	eat	more

ultimately	such	strategies	enable	food	scientists	to	find	the	bliss
point	for	each	productthe	precise	combination	of	salt	sugar	and	fat
that	excites	your	brain	and	keeps	you	coming	back	for	more	the
result	of	course	is	that	you	overeat	because	hyperpalatable	foods	are
more	attractive	to	the	human	brain	as	stephan	guyenet	a
neuroscientist	who	specializes	in	eating	behavior	and	obesity	says
we have	gotten	too	good	at	pushing	our	own	buttons

the	modern	food	industry	and	the	overeating	habits	it	has
spawned	is	just	one	example	of	the	2nd	law	of	behavior	change
make	it	attractive	the	more	attractive	an	opportunity	is	the	more
likely	it	is	to	become	habitforming

look	around	society	is	filled	with	highly	engineered	versions	of
reality	that	are	more	attractive	than	the	world	our	ancestors	evolved	in
stores	feature	mannequins	with	exaggerated	hips	and	breasts	to	sell
clothes	social	media	delivers	more	likes	and	praise	in	a	few	minutes
than	we	could	ever	get	in	the	office	or	at	home	online	porn	splices
together	stimulating	scenes	at	a	rate	that	would	be	impossible	to
replicate	in	real	life	advertisements	are	created	with	a	combination	of
ideal	lighting	professional	makeup	and	photoshopped	editseven	the
model	does not	look	like	the	person	in	the	final	image	these	are	the
supernormal	stimuli	of	our	modern	world	they	exaggerate	features
that	are	naturally	attractive	to	us	and	our	instincts	go	wild	as	a	result
driving	us	into	excessive	shopping	habits	social	media	habits	porn
habits	eating	habits	and	many	others

if	history	serves	as	a	guide	the	opportunities	of	the	future	will	be
more	attractive	than	those	of	today	the	trend	is	for	rewards	to	become
more	concentrated	and	stimuli	to	become	more	enticing	junk	food	is	a
more	concentrated	form	of	calories	than	natural	foods	hard	liquor	is	a
more	concentrated	form	of	alcohol	than	beer	video	games	are	a	more

concentrated	form	of	play	than	board	games	compared	to	nature
these	pleasurepacked	experiences	are	hard	to	resist	we	have	the
brains	of	our	ancestors	but	temptations	they	never	had	to	face

if	you	want	to	increase	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	occur	then	you
need	to	make	it	attractive	throughout	our	discussion	of	the	2nd	law
our	goal	is	to	learn	how	to	make	our	habits	irresistible	while	it	is	not
possible	to	transform	every	habit	into	a	supernormal	stimulus	we	can
make	any	habit	more	enticing	to	do	this	we	must	start	by
understanding	what	a	craving	is	and	how	it	works

we	begin	by	examining	a	biological	signature	that	all	habits	share

the	dopamine	spike

the	dopaminedriven	feedback	loop

scientists	can	track	the	precise	moment	a	craving	occurs	by	measuring
a	neurotransmitter	called	dopamine	the	importance	of	dopamine
became	apparent	in	1954	when	the	neuroscientists	james	olds	and
peter	milner	ran	an	experiment	that	revealed	the	neurological
processes	behind	craving	and	desire	by	implanting	electrodes	in	the
brains	of	rats	the	researchers	blocked	the	release	of	dopamine	to	the
surprise	of	the	scientists	the	rats	lost	all	will	to	live	they	would not	eat
they	would not	have	sex	they	did not	crave	anything	within	a	few	days
the	animals	died	of	thirst

in	followup	studies	other	scientists	also	inhibited	the	dopamine
releasing	parts	of	the	brain	but	this	time	they	squirted	little	droplets
of	sugar	into	the	mouths	of	the	dopaminedepleted	rats	their	little	rat
faces	lit	up	with	pleasurable	grins	from	the	tasty	substance	even
though	dopamine	was	blocked	they	liked	the	sugar	just	as	much	as
before	they	just	did not	want	it	anymore	the	ability	to	experience
pleasure	remained	but	without	dopamine	desire	died	and	without
desire	action	stopped

when	other	researchers	reversed	this	process	and	flooded	the

habits	are	a	dopaminedriven	feedback	loop	every	behavior	that	is

highly	habitformingtaking	drugs	eating	junk	food	playing	video
games	browsing	social	mediais	associated	with	higher	levels	of
dopamine	the	same	can	be	said	for	our	most	basic	habitual	behaviors
like	eating	food	drinking	water	having	sex	and	interacting	socially

for	years	scientists	assumed	dopamine	was	all	about	pleasure	but

now	we	know	it	plays	a	central	role	in	many	neurological	processes
including	motivation	learning	and	memory	punishment	and	aversion
and	voluntary	movement

when	it	comes	to	habits	the	key	takeaway	is	this	dopamine	is
released	not	only	when	you	experience	pleasure	but	also	when	you
anticipate	it	gambling	addicts	have	a	dopamine	spike	right	before
they	place	a	bet	not	after	they	win	cocaine	addicts	get	a	surge	of
dopamine	when	they	see	the	powder	not	after	they	take	it	whenever
you	predict	that	an	opportunity	will	be	rewarding	your	levels	of
dopamine	spike	in	anticipation	and	whenever	dopamine	rises	so	does
your	motivation	to	act

it	is	the	anticipation	of	a	rewardnot	the	fulfillment	of	itthat	gets

us	to	take	action

interestingly	the	reward	system	that	is	activated	in	the	brain	when

you	receive	a	reward	is	the	same	system	that	is	activated	when	you
anticipate	a	reward	this	is	one	reason	the	anticipation	of	an
experience	can	often	feel	better	than	the	attainment	of	it	as	a	child
thinking	about	christmas	morning	can	be	better	than	opening	the
gifts	as	an	adult	daydreaming	about	an	upcoming	vacation	can	be
more	enjoyable	than	actually	being	on	vacation	scientists	refer	to	this
as	the	difference	between	wanting	and	liking

the	dopamine	spike

figure	9	before	a	habit	is	learned	a	dopamine	is	released	when	the
reward	is	experienced	for	the	first	time	the	next	time	around	b	dopamine

spotted	once	a	habit	is	learned	dopamine	will	not	rise	when	a	reward	is
experienced	because	you	already	expect	the	reward	however	if	you	see	a
cue	and	expect	a	reward	but	do	not	get	one	then	dopamine	will	drop	in
disappointment	c	the	sensitivity	of	the	dopamine	response	can	clearly	be
seen	when	a	reward	is	provided	late	d	first	the	cue	is	identified	and
dopamine	rises	as	a	craving	builds	next	a	response	is	taken	but	the	reward
does	not	come	as	quickly	as	expected	and	dopamine	begins	to	drop	finally
when	the	reward	comes	a	little	later	than	you	had	hoped	dopamine	spikes
again	it	is	as	if	the	brain	is	saying	see	i	knew	i	was	right	do not	forget	to
repeat	this	action	next	time

your	brain	has	far	more	neural	circuitry	allocated	for	wanting
rewards	than	for	liking	them	the	wanting	centers	in	the	brain	are
large	the	brain	stem	the	nucleus	accumbens	the	ventral	tegmental
area	the	dorsal	striatum	the	amygdala	and	portions	of	the	prefrontal
cortex	by	comparison	the	liking	centers	of	the	brain	are	much
smaller	they	are	often	referred	to	as	hedonic	hot	spots	and	are
distributed	like	tiny	islands	throughout	the	brain	for	instance
researchers	have	found	that	100	percent	of	the	nucleus	accumbens	is
activated	during	wanting	meanwhile	only	10	percent	of	the	structure
is	activated	during	liking

the	fact	that	the	brain	allocates	so	much	precious	space	to	the

regions	responsible	for	craving	and	desire	provides	further	evidence	of
the	crucial	role	these	processes	play	desire	is	the	engine	that	drives
behavior	every	action	is	taken	because	of	the	anticipation	that
precedes	it	it	is	the	craving	that	leads	to	the	response

these	insights	reveal	the	importance	of	the	2nd	law	of	behavior

change	we	need	to	make	our	habits	attractive	because	it	is	the
expectation	of	a	rewarding	experience	that	motivates	us	to	act	in	the
first	place	this	is	where	a	strategy	known	as	temptation	bundling
comes	into	play

how	to	use	temptation	bundling	to	make	your	habits
more	attractive

ronan	byrne	an	electrical	engineering	student	in	dublin	ireland
enjoyed	watching	netflix	but	he	also	knew	that	he	should	exercise
more	often	than	he	did	putting	his	engineering	skills	to	use	byrne
hacked	his	stationary	bike	and	connected	it	to	his	laptop	and
television	then	he	wrote	a	computer	program	that	would	allow	netflix
to	run	only	if	he	was	cycling	at	a	certain	speed	if	he	slowed	down	for
too	long	whatever	show	he	was	watching	would	pause	until	he	started
pedaling	again	he	was	in	the	words	of	one	fan	eliminating	obesity
one	netflix	binge	at	a	time

he	was	also	employing	temptation	bundling	to	make	his	exercise
habit	more	attractive	temptation	bundling	works	by	linking	an	action
you	want	to	do	with	an	action	you	need	to	do	in	byrnes	case	he
bundled	watching	netflix	the	thing	he	wanted	to	do	with	riding	his
stationary	bike	the	thing	he	needed	to	do

businesses	are	masters	at	temptation	bundling	for	instance	when
the	american	broadcasting	company	more	commonly	known	as	abc
launched	its	thursdaynight	television	lineup	for	the	20142015
season	they	promoted	temptation	bundling	on	a	massive	scale

every	thursday	the	company	would	air	three	shows	created	by
screenwriter	shonda	rhimesgreys	anatomy	scandal	and	how	to
get	away	with	murder	they	branded	it	as	tgit	on	abc	tgit
stands	for	thank	god	its	thursday	in	addition	to	promoting	the
shows	abc	encouraged	viewers	to	make	popcorn	drink	red	wine	and
enjoy	the	evening

andrew	kubitz	head	of	scheduling	for	abc	described	the	idea

behind	the	campaign	we	see	thursday	night	as	a	viewership
opportunity	with	either	couples	or	women	by	themselves	who	want	to
sit	down	and	escape	and	have	fun	and	drink	their	red	wine	and	have
some	popcorn	the	brilliance	of	this	strategy	is	that	abc	was
associating	the	thing	they	needed	viewers	to	do	watch	their	shows
with	activities	their	viewers	already	wanted	to	do	relax	drink	wine
and	eat	popcorn

over	time	people	began	to	connect	watching	abc	with	feeling
relaxed	and	entertained	if	you	drink	red	wine	and	eat	popcorn	at	8
pm	every	thursday	then	eventually	8	pm	on	thursday	means
relaxation	and	entertainment	the	reward	gets	associated	with	the	cue
and	the	habit	of	turning	on	the	television	becomes	more	attractive

you are	more	likely	to	find	a	behavior	attractive	if	you	get	to	do	one

of	your	favorite	things	at	the	same	time	perhaps	you	want	to	hear
about	the	latest	celebrity	gossip	but	you	need	to	get	in	shape	using
temptation	bundling	you	could	only	read	the	tabloids	and	watch
reality	shows	at	the	gym	maybe	you	want	to	get	a	pedicure	but	you
need	to	clean	out	your	email	inbox	solution	only	get	a	pedicure	while
processing	overdue	work	emails

temptation	bundling	is	one	way	to	apply	a	psychology	theory
known	as	premacks	principle	named	after	the	work	of	professor
david	premack	the	principle	states	that	more	probable	behaviors	will
reinforce	less	probable	behaviors	in	other	words	even	if	you	do not
really	want	to	process	overdue	work	emails	you will	become	conditioned
to	do	it	if	it	means	you	get	to	do	something	you	really	want	to	do	along
the	way

you	can	even	combine	temptation	bundling	with	the	habit	stacking
strategy	we	discussed	in	chapter	5	to	create	a	set	of	rules	to	guide	your
behavior

the	habit	stacking		temptation	bundling	formula	is

1	 after	current	habit	i	will	habit	i	need

2	 after	habit	i	need	i	will	habit	i	want

if	you	want	to	read	the	news	but	you	need	to	express	more

gratitude

1	 after	i	get	my	morning	coffee	i	will	say	one	thing	i am	grateful

for	that	happened	yesterday	need

2	 after	i	say	one	thing	i am	grateful	for	i	will	read	the	news	want

if	you	want	to	watch	sports	but	you	need	to	make	sales	calls

1	 after	i	get	back	from	my	lunch	break	i	will	call	three	potential

clients	need

2	 after	i	call	three	potential	clients	i	will	check	espn	want

if	you	want	to	check	facebook	but	you	need	to	exercise	more

1	 after	i	pull	out	my	phone	i	will	do	ten	burpees	need

2	 after	i	do	ten	burpees	i	will	check	facebook	want

the	hope	is	that	eventually	you will	look	forward	to	calling	three

clients	or	doing	ten	burpees	because	it	means	you	get	to	read	the	latest
sports	news	or	check	facebook	doing	the	thing	you	need	to	do	means
you	get	to	do	the	thing	you	want	to	do

we	began	this	chapter	by	discussing	supernormal	stimuli	which	are

heightened	versions	of	reality	that	increase	our	desire	to	take	action
temptation	bundling	is	one	way	to	create	a	heightened	version	of	any
habit	by	connecting	it	with	something	you	already	want	engineering	a
truly	irresistible	habit	is	a	hard	task	but	this	simple	strategy	can	be

employed	to	make	nearly	any	habit	more	attractive	than	it	would	be
otherwise

the	role	of	family	and	friends	in	shaping
your	habits

i

n	1965	a	hungarian	man	named	laszlo	polgar	wrote	a	series	of
strange	letters	to	a	woman	named	klara

laszlo	was	a	firm	believer	in	hard	work	in	fact	it	was	all	he
believed	in	he	completely	rejected	the	idea	of	innate	talent	he
claimed	that	with	deliberate	practice	and	the	development	of	good
habits	a	child	could	become	a	genius	in	any	field	his	mantra	was	a
genius	is	not	born	but	is	educated	and	trained

laszlo	believed	in	this	idea	so	strongly	that	he	wanted	to	test	it	with

his	own	childrenand	he	was	writing	to	klara	because	he	needed	a
wife	willing	to	jump	on	board	klara	was	a	teacher	and	although	she
may	not	have	been	as	adamant	as	laszlo	she	also	believed	that	with
proper	instruction	anyone	could	advance	their	skills

laszlo	decided	chess	would	be	a	suitable	field	for	the	experiment
and	he	laid	out	a	plan	to	raise	his	children	to	become	chess	prodigies
the	kids	would	be	homeschooled	a	rarity	in	hungary	at	the	time	the
house	would	be	filled	with	chess	books	and	pictures	of	famous	chess
players	the	children	would	play	against	each	other	constantly	and
compete	in	the	best	tournaments	they	could	find	the	family	would
keep	a	meticulous	file	system	of	the	tournament	history	of	every
competitor	the	children	faced	their	lives	would	be	dedicated	to	chess

laszlo	successfully	courted	klara	and	within	a	few	years	the
polgars	were	parents	to	three	young	girls	susan	sofia	and	judit

susan	the	oldest	began	playing	chess	when	she	was	four	years	old

within	six	months	she	was	defeating	adults

sofia	the	middle	child	did	even	better	by	fourteen	she	was	a	world

champion	and	a	few	years	later	she	became	a	grandmaster

judit	the	youngest	was	the	best	of	all	by	age	five	she	could	beat
her	father	at	twelve	she	was	the	youngest	player	ever	listed	among
the	top	one	hundred	chess	players	in	the	world	at	fifteen	years	and
four	months	old	she	became	the	youngest	grandmaster	of	all	time
younger	than	bobby	fischer	the	previous	record	holder	for	twenty
seven	years	she	was	the	numberoneranked	female	chess	player	in
the	world

the	childhood	of	the	polgar	sisters	was	atypical	to	say	the	least

and	yet	if	you	ask	them	about	it	they	claim	their	lifestyle	was
attractive	even	enjoyable	in	interviews	the	sisters	talk	about	their
childhood	as	entertaining	rather	than	grueling	they	loved	playing
chess	they	could not	get	enough	of	it	once	laszlo	reportedly	found
sofia	playing	chess	in	the	bathroom	in	the	middle	of	the	night
encouraging	her	to	go	back	to	sleep	he	said	sofia	leave	the	pieces
alone	to	which	she	replied	daddy	they	will not	leave	me	alone

the	polgar	sisters	grew	up	in	a	culture	that	prioritized	chess	above

all	elsepraised	them	for	it	rewarded	them	for	it	in	their	world	an
obsession	with	chess	was	normal	and	as	we	are	about	to	see	whatever
habits	are	normal	in	your	culture	are	among	the	most	attractive
behaviors	you will	find

the	seductive	pull	of	social	norms

humans	are	herd	animals	we	want	to	fit	in	to	bond	with	others	and
to	earn	the	respect	and	approval	of	our	peers	such	inclinations	are
essential	to	our	survival	for	most	of	our	evolutionary	history	our
ancestors	lived	in	tribes	becoming	separated	from	the	tribeor	worse
being	cast	outwas	a	death	sentence	the	lone	wolf	dies	but	the	pack
survives

meanwhile	those	who	collaborated	and	bonded	with	others	enjoyed

increased	safety	mating	opportunities	and	access	to	resources	as
charles	darwin	noted	in	the	long	history	of	humankind	those	who
learned	to	collaborate	and	improvise	most	effectively	have	prevailed
as	a	result	one	of	the	deepest	human	desires	is	to	belong	and	this
ancient	preference	exerts	a	powerful	influence	on	our	modern
behavior

we	do not	choose	our	earliest	habits	we	imitate	them	we	follow	the

script	handed	down	by	our	friends	and	family	our	church	or	school
our	local	community	and	society	at	large	each	of	these	cultures	and
groups	comes	with	its	own	set	of	expectations	and	standardswhen
and	whether	to	get	married	how	many	children	to	have	which
holidays	to	celebrate	how	much	money	to	spend	on	your	childs
birthday	party	in	many	ways	these	social	norms	are	the	invisible	rules
that	guide	your	behavior	each	day	you are	always	keeping	them	in
mind	even	if	they	are	at	the	not	top	of	your	mind	often	you	follow	the
habits	of	your	culture	without	thinking	without	questioning	and
sometimes	without	remembering	as	the	french	philosopher	michel
de	montaigne	wrote	the	customs	and	practices	of	life	in	society
sweep	us	along

most	of	the	time	going	along	with	the	group	does	not	feel	like	a
burden	everyone	wants	to	belong	if	you	grow	up	in	a	family	that
rewards	you	for	your	chess	skills	playing	chess	will	seem	like	a	very
attractive	thing	to	do	if	you	work	in	a	job	where	everyone	wears
expensive	suits	then	you will	be	inclined	to	splurge	on	one	as	well	if	all
of	your	friends	are	sharing	an	inside	joke	or	using	a	new	phrase	you will
want	to	do	it	too	so	they	know	that	you	get	it	behaviors	are
attractive	when	they	help	us	fit	in

we	imitate	the	habits	of	three	groups	in	particular

1	 the	close

2	 the	many

3	 the	powerful

each	group	offers	an	opportunity	to	leverage	the	2nd	law	of

behavior	change	and	make	our	habits	more	attractive

1	imitating	the	close

proximity	has	a	powerful	effect	on	our	behavior	this	is	true	of	the
physical	environment	as	we	discussed	in	chapter	6	but	it	is	also	true
of	the	social	environment

we	pick	up	habits	from	the	people	around	us	we	copy	the	way	our

parents	handle	arguments	the	way	our	peers	flirt	with	one	another

the	way	our	coworkers	get	results	when	your	friends	smoke	pot	you
give	it	a	try	too	when	your	wife	has	a	habit	of	doublechecking	that
the	door	is	locked	before	going	to	bed	you	pick	it	up	as	well

i	find	that	i	often	imitate	the	behavior	of	those	around	me	without
realizing	it	in	conversation	ill	automatically	assume	the	body	posture
of	the	other	person	in	college	i	began	to	talk	like	my	roommates
when	traveling	to	other	countries	i	unconsciously	imitate	the	local
accent	despite	reminding	myself	to	stop

as	a	general	rule	the	closer	we	are	to	someone	the	more	likely	we
are	to	imitate	some	of	their	habits	one	groundbreaking	study	tracked
twelve	thousand	people	for	thirtytwo	years	and	found	that	a	persons
chances	of	becoming	obese	increased	by	57	percent	if	he	or	she	had	a
friend	who	became	obese	it	works	the	other	way	too	another	study
found	that	if	one	person	in	a	relationship	lost	weight	the	other	partner
would	also	slim	down	about	one	third	of	the	time	our	friends	and
family	provide	a	sort	of	invisible	peer	pressure	that	pulls	us	in	their
direction

of	course	peer	pressure	is	bad	only	if	you are	surrounded	by	bad
influences	when	astronaut	mike	massimino	was	a	graduate	student	at
mit	he	took	a	small	robotics	class	of	the	ten	people	in	the	class	four
became	astronauts	if	your	goal	was	to	make	it	into	space	then	that
room	was	about	the	best	culture	you	could	ask	for	similarly	one	study
found	that	the	higher	your	best	friends	iq	at	age	eleven	or	twelve	the
higher	your	iq	would	be	at	age	fifteen	even	after	controlling	for
natural	levels	of	intelligence	we	soak	up	the	qualities	and	practices	of
those	around	us

one	of	the	most	effective	things	you	can	do	to	build	better	habits	is
to	join	a	culture	where	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal	behavior
new	habits	seem	achievable	when	you	see	others	doing	them	every
day	if	you	are	surrounded	by	fit	people	you are	more	likely	to	consider
working	out	to	be	a	common	habit	if	you are	surrounded	by	jazz	lovers
you are	more	likely	to	believe	its	reasonable	to	play	jazz	every	day	your
culture	sets	your	expectation	for	what	is	normal	surround	yourself
with	people	who	have	the	habits	you	want	to	have	yourself	you will	rise
together

to	make	your	habits	even	more	attractive	you	can	take	this	strategy

one	step	further

join	a	culture	where	1	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal
behavior	and	2	you	already	have	something	in	common	with	the
group	steve	kamb	an	entrepreneur	in	new	york	city	runs	a	company
called	nerd	fitness	which	helps	nerds	misfits	and	mutants	lose
weight	get	strong	and	get	healthy	his	clients	include	video	game
lovers	movie	fanatics	and	average	joes	who	want	to	get	in	shape
many	people	feel	out	of	place	the	first	time	they	go	to	the	gym	or	try	to
change	their	diet	but	if	you	are	already	similar	to	the	other	members
of	the	group	in	some	waysay	your	mutual	love	of	star	warschange
becomes	more	appealing	because	it	feels	like	something	people	like
you	already	do

nothing	sustains	motivation	better	than	belonging	to	the	tribe	it
transforms	a	personal	quest	into	a	shared	one	previously	you	were	on
your	own	your	identity	was	singular	you	are	a	reader	you	are	a
musician	you	are	an	athlete	when	you	join	a	book	club	or	a	band	or	a
cycling	group	your	identity	becomes	linked	to	those	around	you
growth	and	change	is	no	longer	an	individual	pursuit	we	are	readers
we	are	musicians	we	are	cyclists	the	shared	identity	begins	to
reinforce	your	personal	identity	this	is	why	remaining	part	of	a	group
after	achieving	a	goal	is	crucial	to	maintaining	your	habits	its
friendship	and	community	that	embed	a	new	identity	and	help
behaviors	last	over	the	long	run

2	imitating	the	many

in	the	1950s	psychologist	solomon	asch	conducted	a	series	of
experiments	that	are	now	taught	to	legions	of	undergrads	each	year	to
begin	each	experiment	the	subject	entered	the	room	with	a	group	of
strangers	unbeknownst	to	them	the	other	participants	were	actors
planted	by	the	researcher	and	instructed	to	deliver	scripted	answers	to
certain	questions

the	group	would	be	shown	one	card	with	a	line	on	it	and	then	a
second	card	with	a	series	of	lines	each	person	was	asked	to	select	the
line	on	the	second	card	that	was	similar	in	length	to	the	line	on	the	first
card	it	was	a	very	simple	task	here	is	an	example	of	two	cards	used	in
the	experiment

conforming	to	social	norms

figure	10	this	is	a	representation	of	two	cards	used	by	solomon	asch	in
his	famous	social	conformity	experiments	the	length	of	the	line	on	the	first
card	left	is	obviously	the	same	as	line	c	but	when	a	group	of	actors
claimed	it	was	a	different	length	the	research	subjects	would	often	change
their	minds	and	go	with	the	crowd	rather	than	believe	their	own	eyes

the	experiment	always	began	the	same	first	there	would	be	some

easy	trials	where	everyone	agreed	on	the	correct	line	after	a	few
rounds	the	participants	were	shown	a	test	that	was	just	as	obvious	as
the	previous	ones	except	the	actors	in	the	room	would	select	an
intentionally	incorrect	answer	for	example	they	would	respond	a
to	the	comparison	shown	in	figure	10	everyone	would	agree	that	the
lines	were	the	same	even	though	they	were	clearly	different

the	subject	who	was	unaware	of	the	ruse	would	immediately
become	bewildered	their	eyes	would	open	wide	they	would	laugh
nervously	to	themselves	they	would	doublecheck	the	reactions	of
other	participants	their	agitation	would	grow	as	one	person	after
another	delivered	the	same	incorrect	response	soon	the	subject	began
to	doubt	their	own	eyes	eventually	they	delivered	the	answer	they
knew	in	their	heart	to	be	incorrect

asch	ran	this	experiment	many	times	and	in	many	different	ways
what	he	discovered	was	that	as	the	number	of	actors	increased	so	did
the	conformity	of	the	subject	if	it	was	just	the	subject	and	one	actor
then	there	was	no	effect	on	the	persons	choice	they	just	assumed	they
were	in	the	room	with	a	dummy	when	two	actors	were	in	the	room
with	the	subject	there	was	still	little	impact	but	as	the	number	of
people	increased	to	three	actors	and	four	and	all	the	way	to	eight	the
subject	became	more	likely	to	secondguess	themselves	by	the	end	of
the	experiment	nearly	75	percent	of	the	subjects	had	agreed	with	the
group	answer	even	though	it	was	obviously	incorrect

whenever	we	are	unsure	how	to	act	we	look	to	the	group	to	guide

our	behavior	we	are	constantly	scanning	our	environment	and
wondering	what	is	everyone	else	doing	we	check	reviews	on
amazon	or	yelp	or	tripadvisor	because	we	want	to	imitate	the	best
buying	eating	and	travel	habits	its	usually	a	smart	strategy	there	is
evidence	in	numbers

but	there	can	be	a	downside

the	normal	behavior	of	the	tribe	often	overpowers	the	desired
behavior	of	the	individual	for	example	one	study	found	that	when	a
chimpanzee	learns	an	effective	way	to	crack	nuts	open	as	a	member	of
one	group	and	then	switches	to	a	new	group	that	uses	a	less	effective
strategy	it	will	avoid	using	the	superior	nut	cracking	method	just	to
blend	in	with	the	rest	of	the	chimps

humans	are	similar	there	is	tremendous	internal	pressure	to
comply	with	the	norms	of	the	group	the	reward	of	being	accepted	is
often	greater	than	the	reward	of	winning	an	argument	looking	smart
or	finding	truth	most	days	wed	rather	be	wrong	with	the	crowd	than
be	right	by	ourselves

the	human	mind	knows	how	to	get	along	with	others	it	wants	to
get	along	with	others	this	is	our	natural	mode	you	can	override	it
you	can	choose	to	ignore	the	group	or	to	stop	caring	what	other	people
thinkbut	it	takes	work	running	against	the	grain	of	your	culture
requires	extra	effort

when	changing	your	habits	means	challenging	the	tribe	change	is

unattractive	when	changing	your	habits	means	fitting	in	with	the
tribe	change	is	very	attractive

3	imitating	the	powerful

humans	everywhere	pursue	power	prestige	and	status	we	want	pins
and	medallions	on	our	jackets	we	want	president	or	partner	in	our
titles	we	want	to	be	acknowledged	recognized	and	praised	this
tendency	can	seem	vain	but	overall	its	a	smart	move	historically	a
person	with	greater	power	and	status	has	access	to	more	resources
worries	less	about	survival	and	proves	to	be	a	more	attractive	mate

we	are	drawn	to	behaviors	that	earn	us	respect	approval

admiration	and	status	we	want	to	be	the	one	in	the	gym	who	can	do
muscleups	or	the	musician	who	can	play	the	hardest	chord
progressions	or	the	parent	with	the	most	accomplished	children
because	these	things	separate	us	from	the	crowd	once	we	fit	in	we
start	looking	for	ways	to	stand	out

this	is	one	reason	we	care	so	much	about	the	habits	of	highly
effective	people	we	try	to	copy	the	behavior	of	successful	people
because	we	desire	success	ourselves	many	of	our	daily	habits	are
imitations	of	people	we	admire	you	replicate	the	marketing	strategies
of	the	most	successful	firms	in	your	industry	you	make	a	recipe	from
your	favorite	baker	you	borrow	the	storytelling	strategies	of	your
favorite	writer	you	mimic	the	communication	style	of	your	boss	we
imitate	people	we	envy

highstatus	people	enjoy	the	approval	respect	and	praise	of	others

and	that	means	if	a	behavior	can	get	us	approval	respect	and	praise
we	find	it	attractive

we	are	also	motivated	to	avoid	behaviors	that	would	lower	our
status	we	trim	our	hedges	and	mow	our	lawn	because	we	do not	want
to	be	the	slob	of	the	neighborhood	when	our	mother	comes	to	visit
we	clean	up	the	house	because	we	do not	want	to	be	judged	we	are
continually	wondering	what	will	others	think	of	me	and	altering
our	behavior	based	on	the	answer

the	polgar	sistersthe	chess	prodigies	mentioned	at	the	beginning
of	this	chapterare	evidence	of	the	powerful	and	lasting	impact	social
influences	can	have	on	our	behavior	the	sisters	practiced	chess	for
many	hours	each	day	and	continued	this	remarkable	effort	for	decades
but	these	habits	and	behaviors	maintained	their	attractiveness	in	part
because	they	were	valued	by	their	culture	from	the	praise	of	their

parents	to	the	achievement	of	different	status	markers	like	becoming	a
grandmaster	they	had	many	reasons	to	continue	their	effort

chapter	summary

the	culture	we	live	in	determines	which	behaviors	are	attractive
to	us

we	tend	to	adopt	habits	that	are	praised	and	approved	of	by	our
culture	because	we	have	a	strong	desire	to	fit	in	and	belong	to	the
tribe

we	tend	to	imitate	the	habits	of	three	social	groups	the	close
family	and	friends	the	many	the	tribe	and	the	powerful	those
with	status	and	prestige

one	of	the	most	effective	things	you	can	do	to	build	better	habits
is	to	join	a	culture	where	1	your	desired	behavior	is	the	normal
behavior	and	2	you	already	have	something	in	common	with	the
group

the	normal	behavior	of	the	tribe	often	overpowers	the	desired
behavior	of	the	individual	most	days	wed	rather	be	wrong	with
the	crowd	than	be	right	by	ourselves

if	a	behavior	can	get	us	approval	respect	and	praise	we	find	it
attractive

how	to	find	and	fix	the	causes	of	your
bad	habits

i

n	late	2012	i	was	sitting	in	an	old	apartment	just	a	few	blocks	from
istanbuls	most	famous	street	istiklal	caddesi	i	was	in	the	middle	of

a	fourday	trip	to	turkey	and	my	guide	mike	was	relaxing	in	a	worn
out	armchair	a	few	feet	away

mike	was not	really	a	guide	he	was	just	a	guy	from	maine	who	had
been	living	in	turkey	for	five	years	but	he	offered	to	show	me	around
while	i	was	visiting	the	country	and	i	took	him	up	on	it	on	this
particular	night	i	had	been	invited	to	dinner	with	him	and	a	handful	of
his	turkish	friends

there	were	seven	of	us	and	i	was	the	only	one	who	had not	at	some
point	smoked	at	least	one	pack	of	cigarettes	per	day	i	asked	one	of	the
turks	how	he	got	started	friends	he	said	it	always	starts	with	your
friends	one	friend	smokes	then	you	try	it

what	was	truly	fascinating	was	that	half	of	the	people	in	the	room

had	managed	to	quit	smoking	mike	had	been	smokefree	for	a	few
years	at	that	point	and	he	swore	up	and	down	that	he	broke	the	habit
because	of	a	book	called	allen	carrs	easy	way	to	stop	smoking

it	frees	you	from	the	mental	burden	of	smoking	he	said	it	tells

you	stop	lying	to	yourself	you	know	you	do not	actually	want	to
smoke	you	know	you	do not	really	enjoy	this	it	helps	you	feel	like
you are	not	the	victim	anymore	you	start	to	realize	that	you	do not	need
to	smoke

i	had	never	tried	a	cigarette	but	i	took	a	look	at	the	book	afterward

out	of	curiosity	the	author	employs	an	interesting	strategy	to	help

smokers	eliminate	their	cravings	he	systematically	reframes	each	cue
associated	with	smoking	and	gives	it	a	new	meaning

he	says	things	like

you	think	you	are	quitting	something	but	you are	not	quitting
anything	because	cigarettes	do	nothing	for	you

you	think	smoking	is	something	you	need	to	do	to	be	social	but
its	not	you	can	be	social	without	smoking	at	all

you	think	smoking	is	about	relieving	stress	but	its	not	smoking
does	not	relieve	your	nerves	it	destroys	them

over	and	over	he	repeats	these	phrases	and	others	like	them	get
it	clearly	into	your	mind	he	says	you	are	losing	nothing	and	you	are
making	marvelous	positive	gains	not	only	in	health	energy	and	money
but	also	in	confidence	selfrespect	freedom	and	most	important	of
all	in	the	length	and	quality	of	your	future	life

by	the	time	you	get	to	the	end	of	the	book	smoking	seems	like	the
most	ridiculous	thing	in	the	world	to	do	and	if	you	no	longer	expect
smoking	to	bring	you	any	benefits	you	have	no	reason	to	smoke	it	is
an	inversion	of	the	2nd	law	of	behavior	change	make	it	unattractive

now	i	know	this	idea	might	sound	overly	simplistic	just	change	your
mind	and	you	can	quit	smoking	but	stick	with	me	for	a	minute

where	cravings	come	from

every	behavior	has	a	surface	level	craving	and	a	deeper	underlying
motive	i	often	have	a	craving	that	goes	something	like	this	i	want	to
eat	tacos	if	you	were	to	ask	me	why	i	want	to	eat	tacos	i	would not
say	because	i	need	food	to	survive	but	the	truth	is	somewhere	deep
down	i	am	motivated	to	eat	tacos	because	i	have	to	eat	to	survive	the
underlying	motive	is	to	obtain	food	and	water	even	if	my	specific
craving	is	for	a	taco

some	of	our	underlying	motives	include

conserve	energy

obtain	food	and	water

find	love	and	reproduce

connect	and	bond	with	others

win	social	acceptance	and	approval

reduce	uncertainty

achieve	status	and	prestige

a	craving	is	just	a	specific	manifestation	of	a	deeper	underlying
motive	your	brain	did	not	evolve	with	a	desire	to	smoke	cigarettes	or
to	check	instagram	or	to	play	video	games	at	a	deep	level	you	simply
want	to	reduce	uncertainty	and	relieve	anxiety	to	win	social
acceptance	and	approval	or	to	achieve	status

look	at	nearly	any	product	that	is	habitforming	and	you will	see	that

it	does	not	create	a	new	motivation	but	rather	latches	onto	the
underlying	motives	of	human	nature

find	love	and	reproduce		using	tinder

connect	and	bond	with	others		browsing	facebook

win	social	acceptance	and	approval		posting	on	instagram

reduce	uncertainty		searching	on	google

achieve	status	and	prestige		playing	video	games

your	habits	are	modernday	solutions	to	ancient	desires	new
versions	of	old	vices	the	underlying	motives	behind	human	behavior
remain	the	same	the	specific	habits	we	perform	differ	based	on	the
period	of	history

here is	the	powerful	part	there	are	many	different	ways	to	address
the	same	underlying	motive	one	person	might	learn	to	reduce	stress
by	smoking	a	cigarette	another	person	learns	to	ease	their	anxiety	by
going	for	a	run	your	current	habits	are	not	necessarily	the	best	way	to
solve	the	problems	you	face	they	are	just	the	methods	you	learned	to
use	once	you	associate	a	solution	with	the	problem	you	need	to	solve
you	keep	coming	back	to	it

habits	are	all	about	associations	these	associations	determine
whether	we	predict	a	habit	to	be	worth	repeating	or	not	as	we	covered
in	our	discussion	of	the	1st	law	your	brain	is	continually	absorbing

information	and	noticing	cues	in	the	environment	every	time	you
perceive	a	cue	your	brain	runs	a	simulation	and	makes	a	prediction
about	what	to	do	in	the	next	moment

cue	you	notice	that	the	stove	is	hot

prediction	if	i	touch	it	ill	get	burned	so	i	should	avoid	touching	it

cue	you	see	that	the	traffic	light	turned	green

prediction	if	i	step	on	the	gas	ill	make	it	safely	through	the
intersection	and	get	closer	to	my	destination	so	i	should	step	on	the
gas

you	see	a	cue	categorize	it	based	on	past	experience	and	determine
the	appropriate	response

this	all	happens	in	an	instant	but	it	plays	a	crucial	role	in	your
habits	because	every	action	is	preceded	by	a	prediction	life	feels
reactive	but	it	is	actually	predictive	all	day	long	you	are	making	your
best	guess	of	how	to	act	given	what	you have	just	seen	and	what	has
worked	for	you	in	the	past	you	are	endlessly	predicting	what	will
happen	in	the	next	moment

our	behavior	is	heavily	dependent	on	these	predictions	put	another
way	our	behavior	is	heavily	dependent	on	how	we	interpret	the	events
that	happen	to	us	not	necessarily	the	objective	reality	of	the	events
themselves	two	people	can	look	at	the	same	cigarette	and	one	feels
the	urge	to	smoke	while	the	other	is	repulsed	by	the	smell	the	same
cue	can	spark	a	good	habit	or	a	bad	habit	depending	on	your
prediction	the	because	of	your	habits	is	actually	the	prediction	that
precedes	them

these	predictions	lead	to	feelings	which	is	how	we	typically

describe	a	cravinga	feeling	a	desire	an	urge	feelings	and	emotions
transform	the	cues	we	perceive	and	the	predictions	we	make	into	a
signal	that	we	can	apply	they	help	explain	what	we	are	currently
sensing	for	instance	whether	or	not	you	realize	it	you	are	noticing
how	warm	or	cold	you	feel	right	now	if	the	temperature	drops	by	one
degree	you	probably	will not	do	anything	if	the	temperature	drops	ten
degrees	however	you will	feel	cold	and	put	on	another	layer	of	clothing
feeling	cold	was	the	signal	that	prompted	you	to	act	you	have	been
sensing	the	cues	the	entire	time	but	it	is	only	when	you	predict	that
you	would	be	better	off	in	a	different	state	that	you	take	action

a	craving	is	the	sense	that	something	is	missing	it	is	the	desire	to
change	your	internal	state	when	the	temperature	falls	there	is	a	gap
between	what	your	body	is	currently	sensing	and	what	it	wants	to	be
sensing	this	gap	between	your	current	state	and	your	desired	state
provides	a	reason	to	act

desire	is	the	difference	between	where	you	are	now	and	where	you

want	to	be	in	the	future	even	the	tiniest	action	is	tinged	with	the
motivation	to	feel	differently	than	you	do	in	the	moment	when	you
bingeeat	or	light	up	or	browse	social	media	what	you	really	want	is
not	a	potato	chip	or	a	cigarette	or	a	bunch	of	likes	what	you	really
want	is	to	feel	different

our	feelings	and	emotions	tell	us	whether	to	hold	steady	in	our
current	state	or	to	make	a	change	they	help	us	decide	the	best	course
of	action	neurologists	have	discovered	that	when	emotions	and
feelings	are	impaired	we	actually	lose	the	ability	to	make	decisions
we	have	no	signal	of	what	to	pursue	and	what	to	avoid	as	the
neuroscientist	antonio	damasio	explains	it	is	emotion	that	allows
you	to	mark	things	as	good	bad	or	indifferent

to	summarize	the	specific	cravings	you	feel	and	habits	you	perform
are	really	an	attempt	to	address	your	fundamental	underlying	motives
whenever	a	habit	successfully	addresses	a	motive	you	develop	a
craving	to	do	it	again	in	time	you	learn	to	predict	that	checking	social
media	will	help	you	feel	loved	or	that	watching	youtube	will	allow	you
to	forget	your	fears	habits	are	attractive	when	we	associate	them	with
positive	feelings	and	we	can	use	this	insight	to	our	advantage	rather
than	to	our	detriment

how	to	reprogram	your	brain	to	enjoy	hard	habits

you	can	make	hard	habits	more	attractive	if	you	can	learn	to	associate
them	with	a	positive	experience	sometimes	all	you	need	is	a	slight
mindset	shift	for	instance	we	often	talk	about	everything	we	have	to
do	in	a	given	day	you	have	to	wake	up	early	for	work	you	have	to
make	another	sales	call	for	your	business	you	have	to	cook	dinner	for
your	family

now	imagine	changing	just	one	word	you	do not	have	to	you

get	to

you	get	to	wake	up	early	for	work	you	get	to	make	another	sales

call	for	your	business	you	get	to	cook	dinner	for	your	family	by
simply	changing	one	word	you	shift	the	way	you	view	each	event	you
transition	from	seeing	these	behaviors	as	burdens	and	turn	them	into
opportunities

the	key	point	is	that	both	versions	of	reality	are	true	you	have	to
do	those	things	and	you	also	get	to	do	them	we	can	find	evidence	for
whatever	mindset	we	choose

i	once	heard	a	story	about	a	man	who	uses	a	wheelchair	when

asked	if	it	was	difficult	being	confined	he	responded	i am	not	confined
to	my	wheelchairi	am	liberated	by	it	if	it	was not	for	my	wheelchair	i
would	be	bedbound	and	never	able	to	leave	my	house	this	shift	in
perspective	completely	transformed	how	he	lived	each	day

reframing	your	habits	to	highlight	their	benefits	rather	than	their
drawbacks	is	a	fast	and	lightweight	way	to	reprogram	your	mind	and
make	a	habit	seem	more	attractive

exercise	many	people	associate	exercise	with	being	a	challenging

task	that	drains	energy	and	wears	you	down	you	can	just	as	easily
view	it	as	a	way	to	develop	skills	and	build	you	up	instead	of	telling
yourself	i	need	to	go	run	in	the	morning	say	its	time	to	build
endurance	and	get	fast

finance	saving	money	is	often	associated	with	sacrifice	however

you	can	associate	it	with	freedom	rather	than	limitation	if	you	realize
one	simple	truth	living	below	your	current	means	increases	your
future	means	the	money	you	save	this	month	increases	your
purchasing	power	next	month

meditation	anyone	who	has	tried	meditation	for	more	than	three

seconds	knows	how	frustrating	it	can	be	when	the	next	distraction
inevitably	pops	into	your	mind	you	can	transform	frustration	into
delight	when	you	realize	that	each	interruption	gives	you	a	chance	to
practice	returning	to	your	breath	distraction	is	a	good	thing	because
you	need	distractions	to	practice	meditation

pregame	jitters	many	people	feel	anxious	before	delivering	a	big

presentation	or	competing	in	an	important	event	they	experience
quicker	breathing	a	faster	heart	rate	heightened	arousal	if	we
interpret	these	feelings	negatively	then	we	feel	threatened	and	tense
up	if	we	interpret	these	feelings	positively	then	we	can	respond	with

fluidity	and	grace	you	can	reframe	i	am	nervous	to	i	am	excited
and	i am	getting	an	adrenaline	rush	to	help	me	concentrate

these	little	mindset	shifts	are not	magic	but	they	can	help	change

the	feelings	you	associate	with	a	particular	habit	or	situation

if	you	want	to	take	it	a	step	further	you	can	create	a	motivation
ritual	you	simply	practice	associating	your	habits	with	something	you
enjoy	then	you	can	use	that	cue	whenever	you	need	a	bit	of
motivation	for	instance	if	you	always	play	the	same	song	before
having	sex	then	you will	begin	to	link	the	music	with	the	act	whenever
you	want	to	get	in	the	mood	just	press	play

ed	latimore	a	boxer	and	writer	from	pittsburgh	benefited	from	a
similar	strategy	without	knowing	it	odd	realization	he	wrote	my
focus	and	concentration	goes	up	just	by	putting	my	headphones	on
while	writing	i	do not	even	have	to	play	any	music	without	realizing
it	he	was	conditioning	himself	in	the	beginning	he	put	his
headphones	on	played	some	music	he	enjoyed	and	did	focused	work
after	doing	it	five	ten	twenty	times	putting	his	headphones	on
became	a	cue	that	he	automatically	associated	with	increased	focus
the	craving	followed	naturally

athletes	use	similar	strategies	to	get	themselves	in	the	mindset	to

perform	during	my	baseball	career	i	developed	a	specific	ritual	of
stretching	and	throwing	before	each	game	the	whole	sequence	took
about	ten	minutes	and	i	did	it	the	same	way	every	single	time	while	it
physically	warmed	me	up	to	play	more	importantly	it	put	me	in	the
right	mental	state	i	began	to	associate	my	pregame	ritual	with	feeling
competitive	and	focused	even	if	i	was not	motivated	beforehand	by	the
time	i	was	done	with	my	ritual	i	was	in	game	mode

you	can	adapt	this	strategy	for	nearly	any	purpose	say	you	want	to
feel	happier	in	general	find	something	that	makes	you	truly	happy
like	petting	your	dog	or	taking	a	bubble	bathand	then	create	a	short
routine	that	you	perform	every	time	before	you	do	the	thing	you	love
maybe	you	take	three	deep	breaths	and	smile

three	deep	breaths	smile	pet	the	dog	repeat

eventually	you will	begin	to	associate	this	breatheandsmile	routine
with	being	in	a	good	mood	it	becomes	a	cue	that	means	feeling	happy
once	established	you	can	break	it	out	anytime	you	need	to	change
your	emotional	state	stressed	at	work	take	three	deep	breaths	and

smile	sad	about	life	three	deep	breaths	and	smile	once	a	habit	has
been	built	the	cue	can	prompt	a	craving	even	if	it	has	little	to	do	with
the	original	situation

the	key	to	finding	and	fixing	the	causes	of	your	bad	habits	is	to
reframe	the	associations	you	have	about	them	its	not	easy	but	if	you
can	reprogram	your	predictions	you	can	transform	a	hard	habit	into
an	attractive	one

walk	slowly	but	never	backward

o

n	the	first	day	of	class	jerry	uelsmann	a	professor	at	the
university	of	florida	divided	his	film	photography	students	into

two	groups

everyone	on	the	left	side	of	the	classroom	he	explained	would	be	in

the	quantity	group	they	would	be	graded	solely	on	the	amount	of
work	they	produced	on	the	final	day	of	class	he	would	tally	the
number	of	photos	submitted	by	each	student	one	hundred	photos
would	rate	an	a	ninety	photos	a	b	eighty	photos	a	c	and	so	on

meanwhile	everyone	on	the	right	side	of	the	room	would	be	in	the
quality	group	they	would	be	graded	only	on	the	excellence	of	their
work	they	would	only	need	to	produce	one	photo	during	the	semester
but	to	get	an	a	it	had	to	be	a	nearly	perfect	image

at	the	end	of	the	term	he	was	surprised	to	find	that	all	the	best
photos	were	produced	by	the	quantity	group	during	the	semester
these	students	were	busy	taking	photos	experimenting	with
composition	and	lighting	testing	out	various	methods	in	the
darkroom	and	learning	from	their	mistakes	in	the	process	of	creating
hundreds	of	photos	they	honed	their	skills	meanwhile	the	quality
group	sat	around	speculating	about	perfection	in	the	end	they	had
little	to	show	for	their	efforts	other	than	unverified	theories	and	one
mediocre	photo

it	is	easy	to	get	bogged	down	trying	to	find	the	optimal	plan	for

change	the	fastest	way	to	lose	weight	the	best	program	to	build
muscle	the	perfect	idea	for	a	side	hustle	we	are	so	focused	on	figuring
out	the	best	approach	that	we	never	get	around	to	taking	action	as
voltaire	once	wrote	the	best	is	the	enemy	of	the	good

i	refer	to	this	as	the	difference	between	being	in	motion	and	taking

action	the	two	ideas	sound	similar	but	they are	not	the	same	when
you are	in	motion	you are	planning	and	strategizing	and	learning	those
are	all	good	things	but	they	do not	produce	a	result

action	on	the	other	hand	is	the	type	of	behavior	that	will	deliver	an

outcome	if	i	outline	twenty	ideas	for	articles	i	want	to	write	that is
motion	if	i	actually	sit	down	and	write	an	article	that is	action	if	i
search	for	a	better	diet	plan	and	read	a	few	books	on	the	topic	that is
motion	if	i	actually	eat	a	healthy	meal	that is	action

sometimes	motion	is	useful	but	it	will	never	produce	an	outcome
by	itself	it	does not	matter	how	many	times	you	go	talk	to	the	personal
trainer	that	motion	will	never	get	you	in	shape	only	the	action	of
working	out	will	get	the	result	you are	looking	to	achieve

if	motion	does not	lead	to	results	why	do	we	do	it	sometimes	we	do
it	because	we	actually	need	to	plan	or	learn	more	but	more	often	than
not	we	do	it	because	motion	allows	us	to	feel	like	were	making
progress	without	running	the	risk	of	failure	most	of	us	are	experts	at
avoiding	criticism	it	does not	feel	good	to	fail	or	to	be	judged	publicly
so	we	tend	to	avoid	situations	where	that	might	happen	and	that is	the
biggest	reason	why	you	slip	into	motion	rather	than	taking	action	you
want	to	delay	failure

its	easy	to	be	in	motion	and	convince	yourself	that	you are	still
making	progress	you	think	i have	got	conversations	going	with	four
potential	clients	right	now	this	is	good	were	moving	in	the	right
direction	or	i	brainstormed	some	ideas	for	that	book	i	want	to
write	this	is	coming	together

motion	makes	you	feel	like	you are	getting	things	done	but	really

you are	just	preparing	to	get	something	done	when	preparation
becomes	a	form	of	procrastination	you	need	to	change	something	you
do not	want	to	merely	be	planning	you	want	to	be	practicing

if	you	want	to	master	a	habit	the	key	is	to	start	with	repetition	not
perfection	you	do not	need	to	map	out	every	feature	of	a	new	habit	you
just	need	to	practice	it	this	is	the	first	takeaway	of	the	3rd	law	you
just	need	to	get	your	reps	in

how	long	does	it	actually	take	to	form	a	new	habit

habit	formation	is	the	process	by	which	a	behavior	becomes
progressively	more	automatic	through	repetition	the	more	you	repeat
an	activity	the	more	the	structure	of	your	brain	changes	to	become
efficient	at	that	activity	neuroscientists	call	this	longterm
potentiation	which	refers	to	the	strengthening	of	connections	between
neurons	in	the	brain	based	on	recent	patterns	of	activity	with	each
repetition	celltocell	signaling	improves	and	the	neural	connections
tighten	first	described	by	neuropsychologist	donald	hebb	in	1949
this	phenomenon	is	commonly	known	as	hebbs	law	neurons	that
fire	together	wire	together

repeating	a	habit	leads	to	clear	physical	changes	in	the	brain	in

musicians	the	cerebellumcritical	for	physical	movements	like
plucking	a	guitar	string	or	pulling	a	violin	bowis	larger	than	it	is	in
nonmusicians	mathematicians	meanwhile	have	increased	gray
matter	in	the	inferior	parietal	lobule	which	plays	a	key	role	in
computation	and	calculation	its	size	is	directly	correlated	with	the
amount	of	time	spent	in	the	field	the	older	and	more	experienced	the
mathematician	the	greater	the	increase	in	gray	matter

when	scientists	analyzed	the	brains	of	taxi	drivers	in	london	they
found	that	the	hippocampusa	region	of	the	brain	involved	in	spatial
memorywas	significantly	larger	in	their	subjects	than	in	nontaxi
drivers	even	more	fascinating	the	hippocampus	decreased	in	size
when	a	driver	retired	like	the	muscles	of	the	body	responding	to
regular	weight	training	particular	regions	of	the	brain	adapt	as	they
are	used	and	atrophy	as	they	are	abandoned

of	course	the	importance	of	repetition	in	establishing	habits	was
recognized	long	before	neuroscientists	began	poking	around	in	1860
the	english	philosopher	george	h	lewes	noted	in	learning	to	speak
a	new	language	to	play	on	a	musical	instrument	or	to	perform
unaccustomed	movements	great	difficulty	is	felt	because	the	channels
through	which	each	sensation	has	to	pass	have	not	become
established	but	no	sooner	has	frequent	repetition	cut	a	pathway	than
this	difficulty	vanishes	the	actions	become	so	automatic	that	they	can
be	performed	while	the	mind	is	otherwise	engaged	both	common
sense	and	scientific	evidence	agree	repetition	is	a	form	of	change

each	time	you	repeat	an	action	you	are	activating	a	particular
neural	circuit	associated	with	that	habit	this	means	that	simply
putting	in	your	reps	is	one	of	the	most	critical	steps	you	can	take	to

encoding	a	new	habit	it	is	why	the	students	who	took	tons	of	photos
improved	their	skills	while	those	who	merely	theorized	about	perfect
photos	did	not	one	group	engaged	in	active	practice	the	other	in
passive	learning	one	in	action	the	other	in	motion

all	habits	follow	a	similar	trajectory	from	effortful	practice	to

automatic	behavior	a	process	known	as	automaticity	automaticity	is
the	ability	to	perform	a	behavior	without	thinking	about	each	step
which	occurs	when	the	nonconscious	mind	takes	over

it	looks	something	like	this

the	habit	line

figure	11	in	the	beginning	point	a	a	habit	requires	a	good	deal	of	effort
and	concentration	to	perform	after	a	few	repetitions	point	b	it	gets	easier
but	still	requires	some	conscious	attention	with	enough	practice	point	c
the	habit	becomes	more	automatic	than	conscious	beyond	this	threshold
the	habit	linethe	behavior	can	be	done	more	or	less	without	thinking	a
new	habit	has	been	formed

on	the	following	page	you will	see	what	it	looks	like	when	researchers

track	the	level	of	automaticity	for	an	actual	habit	like	walking	for	ten
minutes	each	day	the	shape	of	these	charts	which	scientists	call

learning	curves	reveals	an	important	truth	about	behavior	change
habits	form	based	on	frequency	not	time

walking	10	minutes	per	day

figure	12	this	graph	shows	someone	who	built	the	habit	of	walking	for
ten	minutes	after	breakfast	each	day	notice	that	as	the	repetitions	increase
so	does	automaticity	until	the	behavior	is	as	easy	and	automatic	as	it	can
be

one	of	the	most	common	questions	i	hear	is	how	long	does	it	take
to	build	a	new	habit	but	what	people	really	should	be	asking	is	how
many	does	it	take	to	form	a	new	habit	that	is	how	many	repetitions
are	required	to	make	a	habit	automatic

there	is	nothing	magical	about	time	passing	with	regard	to	habit
formation	it	does not	matter	if	its	been	twentyone	days	or	thirty	days
or	three	hundred	days	what	matters	is	the	rate	at	which	you	perform
the	behavior	you	could	do	something	twice	in	thirty	days	or	two
hundred	times	its	the	frequency	that	makes	the	difference	your
current	habits	have	been	internalized	over	the	course	of	hundreds	if
not	thousands	of	repetitions	new	habits	require	the	same	level	of
frequency	you	need	to	string	together	enough	successful	attempts
until	the	behavior	is	firmly	embedded	in	your	mind	and	you	cross	the
habit	line

in	practice	it	does not	really	matter	how	long	it	takes	for	a	habit	to
become	automatic	what	matters	is	that	you	take	the	actions	you	need
to	take	to	make	progress	whether	an	action	is	fully	automatic	is	of	less
importance

to	build	a	habit	you	need	to	practice	it	and	the	most	effective	way

to	make	practice	happen	is	to	adhere	to	the	3rd	law	of	behavior
change	make	it	easy	the	chapters	that	follow	will	show	you	how	to
do	exactly	that

chapter	summary

the	3rd	law	of	behavior	change	is	make	it	easy

the	most	effective	form	of	learning	is	practice	not	planning

focus	on	taking	action	not	being	in	motion

habit	formation	is	the	process	by	which	a	behavior	becomes
progressively	more	automatic	through	repetition

the	amount	of	time	you	have	been	performing	a	habit	is	not	as
important	as	the	number	of	times	you	have	performed	it

the	law	of	least	effort

i

n	his	awardwinning	book	guns	germs	and	steel	anthropologist
and	biologist	jared	diamond	points	out	a	simple	fact	different

continents	have	different	shapes	at	first	glance	this	statement	seems
rather	obvious	and	unimportant	but	it	turns	out	to	have	a	profound
impact	on	human	behavior

the	primary	axis	of	the	americas	runs	from	north	to	south	that	is

the	landmass	of	north	and	south	america	tends	to	be	tall	and	thin
rather	than	wide	and	fat	the	same	is	generally	true	for	africa
meanwhile	the	landmass	that	makes	up	europe	asia	and	the	middle
east	is	the	opposite	this	massive	stretch	of	land	tends	to	be	more	east
west	in	shape	according	to	diamond	this	difference	in	shape	played	a
significant	role	in	the	spread	of	agriculture	over	the	centuries

when	agriculture	began	to	spread	around	the	globe	farmers	had	an

easier	time	expanding	along	eastwest	routes	than	along	northsouth
ones	this	is	because	locations	along	the	same	latitude	generally	share
similar	climates	amounts	of	sunlight	and	rainfall	and	changes	in
season	these	factors	allowed	farmers	in	europe	and	asia	to
domesticate	a	few	crops	and	grow	them	along	the	entire	stretch	of	land
from	france	to	china

the	shape	of	human	behavior

figure	13	the	primary	axis	of	europe	and	asia	is	eastwest	the	primary
axis	of	the	americas	and	africa	is	northsouth	this	leads	to	a	wider	range	of
climates	upanddown	the	americas	than	across	europe	and	asia	as	a
result	agriculture	spread	nearly	twice	as	fast	across	europe	and	asia	than	it
did	elsewhere	the	behavior	of	farmerseven	across	hundreds	or
thousands	of	yearswas	constrained	by	the	amount	of	friction	in	the
environment

by	comparison	the	climate	varies	greatly	when	traveling	from	north

to	south	just	imagine	how	different	the	weather	is	in	florida
compared	to	canada	you	can	be	the	most	talented	farmer	in	the
world	but	it	will not	help	you	grow	florida	oranges	in	the	canadian
winter	snow	is	a	poor	substitute	for	soil	in	order	to	spread	crops
along	northsouth	routes	farmers	would	need	to	find	and	domesticate
new	plants	whenever	the	climate	changed

as	a	result	agriculture	spread	two	to	three	times	faster	across	asia

and	europe	than	it	did	up	and	down	the	americas	over	the	span	of
centuries	this	small	difference	had	a	very	big	impact	increased	food
production	allowed	for	more	rapid	population	growth	with	more
people	these	cultures	were	able	to	build	stronger	armies	and	were
better	equipped	to	develop	new	technologies	the	changes	started	out

smalla	crop	that	spread	slightly	farther	a	population	that	grew
slightly	fasterbut	compounded	into	substantial	differences	over	time

the	spread	of	agriculture	provides	an	example	of	the	3rd	law	of
behavior	change	on	a	global	scale	conventional	wisdom	holds	that
motivation	is	the	key	to	habit	change	maybe	if	you	really	wanted	it
you would	actually	do	it	but	the	truth	is	our	real	motivation	is	to	be	lazy
and	to	do	what	is	convenient	and	despite	what	the	latest	productivity
best	seller	will	tell	you	this	is	a	smart	strategy	not	a	dumb	one

energy	is	precious	and	the	brain	is	wired	to	conserve	it	whenever
possible	it	is	human	nature	to	follow	the	law	of	least	effort	which
states	that	when	deciding	between	two	similar	options	people	will
naturally	gravitate	toward	the	option	that	requires	the	least	amount	of
work	for	example	expanding	your	farm	to	the	east	where	you	can
grow	the	same	crops	rather	than	heading	north	where	the	climate	is
different	out	of	all	the	possible	actions	we	could	take	the	one	that	is
realized	is	the	one	that	delivers	the	most	value	for	the	least	effort	we
are	motivated	to	do	what	is	easy

every	action	requires	a	certain	amount	of	energy	the	more	energy

required	the	less	likely	it	is	to	occur	if	your	goal	is	to	do	a	hundred
pushups	per	day	that is	a	lot	of	energy	in	the	beginning	when	you are
motivated	and	excited	you	can	muster	the	strength	to	get	started	but
after	a	few	days	such	a	massive	effort	feels	exhausting	meanwhile
sticking	to	the	habit	of	doing	one	pushup	per	day	requires	almost	no
energy	to	get	started	and	the	less	energy	a	habit	requires	the	more
likely	it	is	to	occur

look	at	any	behavior	that	fills	up	much	of	your	life	and	you will	see
that	it	can	be	performed	with	very	low	levels	of	motivation	habits	like
scrolling	on	our	phones	checking	email	and	watching	television	steal
so	much	of	our	time	because	they	can	be	performed	almost	without
effort	they	are	remarkably	convenient

in	a	sense	every	habit	is	just	an	obstacle	to	getting	what	you	really
want	dieting	is	an	obstacle	to	getting	fit	meditation	is	an	obstacle	to
feeling	calm	journaling	is	an	obstacle	to	thinking	clearly	you	do not
actually	want	the	habit	itself	what	you	really	want	is	the	outcome	the
habit	delivers	the	greater	the	obstaclethat	is	the	more	difficult	the
habitthe	more	friction	there	is	between	you	and	your	desired	end
state	this	is	why	it	is	crucial	to	make	your	habits	so	easy	that	you will	do

them	even	when	you	do not	feel	like	it	if	you	can	make	your	good	habits
more	convenient	you will	be	more	likely	to	follow	through	on	them

but	what	about	all	the	moments	when	we	seem	to	do	the	opposite
if	were	all	so	lazy	then	how	do	you	explain	people	accomplishing	hard
things	like	raising	a	child	or	starting	a	business	or	climbing	mount
everest

certainly	you	are	capable	of	doing	very	hard	things	the	problem	is

that	some	days	you	feel	like	doing	the	hard	work	and	some	days	you
feel	like	giving	in	on	the	tough	days	its	crucial	to	have	as	many	things
working	in	your	favor	as	possible	so	that	you	can	overcome	the
challenges	life	naturally	throws	your	way	the	less	friction	you	face	the
easier	it	is	for	your	stronger	self	to	emerge	the	idea	behind	make	it
easy	is	not	to	only	do	easy	things	the	idea	is	to	make	it	as	easy	as
possible	in	the	moment	to	do	things	that	payoff	in	the	long	run

how	to	achieve	more	with	less	effort

imagine	you	are	holding	a	garden	hose	that	is	bent	in	the	middle
some	water	can	flow	through	but	not	very	much	if	you	want	to
increase	the	rate	at	which	water	passes	through	the	hose	you	have	two
options	the	first	option	is	to	crank	up	the	valve	and	force	more	water
out	the	second	option	is	to	simply	remove	the	bend	in	the	hose	and	let
water	flow	through	naturally

trying	to	pump	up	your	motivation	to	stick	with	a	hard	habit	is	like
trying	to	force	water	through	a	bent	hose	you	can	do	it	but	it	requires
a	lot	of	effort	and	increases	the	tension	in	your	life	meanwhile	making
your	habits	simple	and	easy	is	like	removing	the	bend	in	the	hose
rather	than	trying	to	overcome	the	friction	in	your	life	you	reduce	it

one	of	the	most	effective	ways	to	reduce	the	friction	associated	with

your	habits	is	to	practice	environment	design	in	chapter	6	we
discussed	environment	design	as	a	method	for	making	cues	more
obvious	but	you	can	also	optimize	your	environment	to	make	actions
easier	for	example	when	deciding	where	to	practice	a	new	habit	it	is
best	to	choose	a	place	that	is	already	along	the	path	of	your	daily
routine	habits	are	easier	to	build	when	they	fit	into	the	flow	of	your
life	you	are	more	likely	to	go	to	the	gym	if	it	is	on	your	way	to	work
because	stopping	does not	add	much	friction	to	your	lifestyle	by

comparison	if	the	gym	is	off	the	path	of	your	normal	commuteeven
by	just	a	few	blocksnow	you are	going	out	of	your	way	to	get	there

perhaps	even	more	effective	is	reducing	the	friction	within	your

home	or	office	too	often	we	try	to	start	habits	in	highfriction
environments	we	try	to	follow	a	strict	diet	while	we	are	out	to	dinner
with	friends	we	try	to	write	a	book	in	a	chaotic	household	we	try	to
concentrate	while	using	a	smartphone	filled	with	distractions	it
does not	have	to	be	this	way	we	can	remove	the	points	of	friction	that
hold	us	back	this	is	precisely	what	electronics	manufacturers	in	japan
began	to	do	in	the	1970s

in	an	article	published	in	the	new	yorker	titled	better	all	the

time	james	suroweicki	writes

japanese	firms	emphasized	what	came	to	be	known	as	lean

production	relentlessly	looking	to	remove	waste	of	all	kinds	from	the
production	process	down	to	redesigning	workspaces	so	workers
did not	have	to	waste	time	twisting	and	turning	to	reach	their	tools	the
result	was	that	japanese	factories	were	more	efficient	and	japanese
products	were	more	reliable	than	american	ones	in	1974	service	calls
for	americanmade	color	televisions	were	five	times	as	common	as	for
japanese	televisions	by	1979	it	took	american	workers	three	times	as
long	to	assemble	their	sets

i	like	to	refer	to	this	strategy	as	addition	by	subtraction	the

japanese	companies	looked	for	every	point	of	friction	in	the
manufacturing	process	and	eliminated	it	as	they	subtracted	wasted
effort	they	added	customers	and	revenue	similarly	when	we	remove
the	points	of	friction	that	sap	our	time	and	energy	we	can	achieve
more	with	less	effort	this	is	one	reason	tidying	up	can	feel	so	good
we	are	simultaneously	moving	forward	and	lightening	the	cognitive
load	our	environment	places	on	us

if	you	look	at	the	most	habitforming	products	you will	notice	that
one	of	the	things	these	goods	and	services	do	best	is	remove	little	bits
of	friction	from	your	life	meal	delivery	services	reduce	the	friction	of
shopping	for	groceries	dating	apps	reduce	the	friction	of	making
social	introductions	ridesharing	services	reduce	the	friction	of
getting	across	town	text	messaging	reduces	the	friction	of	sending	a
letter	in	the	mail

like	a	japanese	television	manufacturer	redesigning	their

workspace	to	reduce	wasted	motion	successful	companies	design	their
products	to	automate	eliminate	or	simplify	as	many	steps	as	possible
they	reduce	the	number	of	fields	on	each	form	they	pare	down	the
number	of	clicks	required	to	create	an	account	they	deliver	their
products	with	easytounderstand	directions	or	ask	their	customers	to
make	fewer	choices

when	the	first	voiceactivated	speakers	were	releasedproducts

like	google	home	amazon	echo	and	apple	homepodi	asked	a
friend	what	he	liked	about	the	product	he	had	purchased	he	said	it
was	just	easier	to	say	play	some	country	music	than	to	pull	out	his
phone	open	the	music	app	and	pick	a	playlist	of	course	just	a	few
years	earlier	having	unlimited	access	to	music	in	your	pocket	was	a
remarkably	frictionless	behavior	compared	to	driving	to	the	store	and
buying	a	cd	business	is	a	neverending	quest	to	deliver	the	same
result	in	an	easier	fashion

similar	strategies	have	been	used	effectively	by	governments	when

the	british	government	wanted	to	increase	tax	collection	rates	they
switched	from	sending	citizens	to	a	web	page	where	the	tax	form	could
be	downloaded	to	linking	directly	to	the	form	reducing	that	one	step
in	the	process	increased	the	response	rate	from	192	percent	to	234
percent	for	a	country	like	the	united	kingdom	those	percentage
points	represent	millions	in	tax	revenue

the	central	idea	is	to	create	an	environment	where	doing	the	right
thing	is	as	easy	as	possible	much	of	the	battle	of	building	better	habits
comes	down	to	finding	ways	to	reduce	the	friction	associated	with	our
good	habits	and	increase	the	friction	associated	with	our	bad	ones

prime	the	environment	for	future	use

oswald	nuckols	is	an	it	developer	from	natchez	mississippi	he	is
also	someone	who	understands	the	power	of	priming	his	environment

nuckols	dialed	in	his	cleaning	habits	by	following	a	strategy	he

refers	to	as	resetting	the	room	for	instance	when	he	finishes
watching	television	he	places	the	remote	back	on	the	tv	stand
arranges	the	pillows	on	the	couch	and	folds	the	blanket	when	he
leaves	his	car	he	throws	any	trash	away	whenever	he	takes	a	shower
he	wipes	down	the	toilet	while	the	shower	is	warming	up	as	he	notes

the	perfect	time	to	clean	the	toilet	is	right	before	you	wash	yourself	in
the	shower	anyway	the	purpose	of	resetting	each	room	is	not	simply
to	clean	up	after	the	last	action	but	to	prepare	for	the	next	action

when	i	walk	into	a	room	everything	is	in	its	right	place	nuckols
wrote	because	i	do	this	every	day	in	every	room	stuff	always	stays	in
good	shape				people	think	i	work	hard	but	i am	actually	really	lazy
i am	just	proactively	lazy	it	gives	you	so	much	time	back

whenever	you	organize	a	space	for	its	intended	purpose	you	are
priming	it	to	make	the	next	action	easy	for	instance	my	wife	keeps	a
box	of	greeting	cards	that	are	presorted	by	occasionbirthday
sympathy	wedding	graduation	and	more	whenever	necessary	she
grabs	an	appropriate	card	and	sends	it	off	she	is	incredibly	good	at
remembering	to	send	cards	because	she	has	reduced	the	friction	of
doing	so	for	years	i	was	the	opposite	someone	would	have	a	baby
and	i	would	think	i	should	send	a	card	but	then	weeks	would	pass
and	by	the	time	i	remembered	to	pick	one	up	at	the	store	it	was	too
late	the	habit	was not	easy

there	are	many	ways	to	prime	your	environment	so	its	ready	for
immediate	use	if	you	want	to	cook	a	healthy	breakfast	place	the	skillet
on	the	stove	set	the	cooking	spray	on	the	counter	and	lay	out	any
plates	and	utensils	you will	need	the	night	before	when	you	wake	up
making	breakfast	will	be	easy

want	to	draw	more	put	your	pencils	pens	notebooks	and
drawing	tools	on	top	of	your	desk	within	easy	reach

want	to	exercise	set	out	your	workout	clothes	shoes	gym	bag
and	water	bottle	ahead	of	time

want	to	improve	your	diet	chop	up	a	ton	of	fruits	and	vegetables
on	weekends	and	pack	them	in	containers	so	you	have	easy
access	to	healthy	readytoeat	options	during	the	week

these	are	simple	ways	to	make	the	good	habit	the	path	of	least

resistance

you	can	also	invert	this	principle	and	prime	the	environment	to
make	bad	behaviors	difficult	if	you	find	yourself	watching	too	much
television	for	example	then	unplug	it	after	each	use	only	plug	it	back

in	if	you	can	say	out	loud	the	name	of	the	show	you	want	to	watch	this
setup	creates	just	enough	friction	to	prevent	mindless	viewing

if	that	does not	do	it	you	can	take	it	a	step	further	unplug	the

television	and	take	the	batteries	out	of	the	remote	after	each	use	so	it
takes	an	extra	ten	seconds	to	turn	it	back	on	and	if	you are	really	hard
core	move	the	television	out	of	the	living	room	and	into	a	closet	after
each	use	you	can	be	sure	you will	only	take	it	out	when	you	really	want
to	watch	something	the	greater	the	friction	the	less	likely	the	habit

whenever	possible	i	leave	my	phone	in	a	different	room	until

lunch	when	its	right	next	to	me	ill	check	it	all	morning	for	no	reason
at	all	but	when	it	is	in	another	room	i	rarely	think	about	it	and	the
friction	is	high	enough	that	i	will not	go	get	it	without	a	reason	as	a
result	i	get	three	to	four	hours	each	morning	when	i	can	work	without
interruption

if	sticking	your	phone	in	another	room	does not	seem	like	enough
tell	a	friend	or	family	member	to	hide	it	from	you	for	a	few	hours	ask	a
coworker	to	keep	it	at	their	desk	in	the	morning	and	give	it	back	to	you
at	lunch

it	is	remarkable	how	little	friction	is	required	to	prevent	unwanted
behavior	when	i	hide	beer	in	the	back	of	the	fridge	where	i	cannot	see	it
i	drink	less	when	i	delete	social	media	apps	from	my	phone	it	can	be
weeks	before	i	download	them	again	and	log	in	these	tricks	are
unlikely	to	curb	a	true	addiction	but	for	many	of	us	a	little	bit	of
friction	can	be	the	difference	between	sticking	with	a	good	habit	or
sliding	into	a	bad	one	imagine	the	cumulative	impact	of	making
dozens	of	these	changes	and	living	in	an	environment	designed	to
make	the	good	behaviors	easier	and	the	bad	behaviors	harder

whether	we	are	approaching	behavior	change	as	an	individual	a

parent	a	coach	or	a	leader	we	should	ask	ourselves	the	same
question	how	can	we	design	a	world	where	its	easy	to	do	what is
right	redesign	your	life	so	the	actions	that	matter	most	are	also	the
actions	that	are	easiest	to	do

chapter	summary

human	behavior	follows	the	law	of	least	effort	we	will	naturally
gravitate	toward	the	option	that	requires	the	least	amount	of
work

create	an	environment	where	doing	the	right	thing	is	as	easy	as
possible

reduce	the	friction	associated	with	good	behaviors	when	friction
is	low	habits	are	easy

increase	the	friction	associated	with	bad	behaviors	when	friction
is	high	habits	are	difficult

prime	your	environment	to	make	future	actions	easier

how	to	stop	procrastinating	by	using	the
twominute	rule

t

wyla	tharp	is	widely	regarded	as	one	of	the	greatest	dancers	and
choreographers	of	the	modern	era	in	1992	she	was	awarded	a
macarthur	fellowship	often	referred	to	as	the	genius	grant	and	she
has	spent	the	bulk	of	her	career	touring	the	globe	to	perform	her
original	works	she	also	credits	much	of	her	success	to	simple	daily
habits

i	begin	each	day	of	my	life	with	a	ritual	she	writes	i	wake	up	at
530	am	put	on	my	workout	clothes	my	leg	warmers	my	sweat	shirt
and	my	hat	i	walk	outside	my	manhattan	home	hail	a	taxi	and	tell
the	driver	to	take	me	to	the	pumping	iron	gym	at	91st	street	and	first
avenue	where	i	work	out	for	two	hours

the	ritual	is	not	the	stretching	and	weight	training	i	put	my	body
through	each	morning	at	the	gym	the	ritual	is	the	cab	the	moment	i
tell	the	driver	where	to	go	i	have	completed	the	ritual

its	a	simple	act	but	doing	it	the	same	way	each	morning

habitualizes	itmakes	it	repeatable	easy	to	do	it	reduces	the	chance
that	i	would	skip	it	or	do	it	differently	it	is	one	more	item	in	my
arsenal	of	routines	and	one	less	thing	to	think	about

hailing	a	cab	each	morning	may	be	a	tiny	action	but	it	is	a	splendid

example	of	the	3rd	law	of	behavior	change

researchers	estimate	that	40	to	50	percent	of	our	actions	on	any

given	day	are	done	out	of	habit	this	is	already	a	substantial
percentage	but	the	true	influence	of	your	habits	is	even	greater	than
these	numbers	suggest	habits	are	automatic	choices	that	influence	the

conscious	decisions	that	follow	yes	a	habit	can	be	completed	in	just	a
few	seconds	but	it	can	also	shape	the	actions	that	you	take	for	minutes
or	hours	afterward

habits	are	like	the	entrance	ramp	to	a	highway	they	lead	you	down

a	path	and	before	you	know	it	you are	speeding	toward	the	next
behavior	it	seems	to	be	easier	to	continue	what	you	are	already	doing
than	to	start	doing	something	different	you	sit	through	a	bad	movie
for	two	hours	you	keep	snacking	even	when	you are	already	full	you
check	your	phone	for	just	a	second	and	soon	you	have	spent	twenty
minutes	staring	at	the	screen	in	this	way	the	habits	you	follow
without	thinking	often	determine	the	choices	you	make	when	you	are
thinking

each	evening	there	is	a	tiny	momentusually	around	515	pm
that	shapes	the	rest	of	my	night	my	wife	walks	in	the	door	from	work
and	either	we	change	into	our	workout	clothes	and	head	to	the	gym	or
we	crash	onto	the	couch	order	indian	food	and	watch	the	office
similar	to	twyla	tharp	hailing	the	cab	the	ritual	is	changing	into	my
workout	clothes	if	i	change	clothes	i	know	the	workout	will	happen
everything	that	followsdriving	to	the	gym	deciding	which	exercises
to	do	stepping	under	the	baris	easy	once	i have	taken	the	first	step

every	day	there	are	a	handful	of	moments	that	deliver	an	outsized
impact	i	refer	to	these	little	choices	as	decisive	moments	the	moment
you	decide	between	ordering	takeout	or	cooking	dinner	the	moment
you	choose	between	driving	your	car	or	riding	your	bike	the	moment
you	decide	between	starting	your	homework	or	grabbing	the	video
game	controller	these	choices	are	a	fork	in	the	road

decisive	moments

figure	14	the	difference	between	a	good	day	and	a	bad	day	is	often	a
few	productive	and	healthy	choices	made	at	decisive	moments	each	one	is
like	a	fork	in	the	road	and	these	choices	stack	up	throughout	the	day	and
can	ultimately	lead	to	very	different	outcomes

decisive	moments	set	the	options	available	to	your	future	self	for

instance	walking	into	a	restaurant	is	a	decisive	moment	because	it
determines	what	you will	be	eating	for	lunch	technically	you	are	in
control	of	what	you	order	but	in	a	larger	sense	you	can	only	order	an
item	if	it	is	on	the	menu	if	you	walk	into	a	steakhouse	you	can	get	a
sirloin	or	a	rib	eye	but	not	sushi	your	options	are	constrained	by
what is	available	they	are	shaped	by	the	first	choice

we	are	limited	by	where	our	habits	lead	us	this	is	why	mastering
the	decisive	moments	throughout	your	day	is	so	important	each	day	is
made	up	of	many	moments	but	it	is	really	a	few	habitual	choices	that
determine	the	path	you	take	these	little	choices	stack	up	each	one
setting	the	trajectory	for	how	you	spend	the	next	chunk	of	time

habits	are	the	entry	point	not	the	end	point	they	are	the	cab	not

the	gym

the	twominute	rule

even	when	you	know	you	should	start	small	its	easy	to	start	too	big
when	you	dream	about	making	a	change	excitement	inevitably	takes
over	and	you	end	up	trying	to	do	too	much	too	soon	the	most	effective
way	i	know	to	counteract	this	tendency	is	to	use	the	twominute	rule
which	states	when	you	start	a	new	habit	it	should	take	less	than	two
minutes	to	do

you will	find	that	nearly	any	habit	can	be	scaled	down	into	a	two

minute	version

read	before	bed	each	night	becomes	read	one	page

do	thirty	minutes	of	yoga	becomes	take	out	my	yoga	mat

study	for	class	becomes	open	my	notes

fold	the	laundry	becomes	fold	one	pair	of	socks

run	three	miles	becomes	tie	my	running	shoes

the	idea	is	to	make	your	habits	as	easy	as	possible	to	start	anyone
can	meditate	for	one	minute	read	one	page	or	put	one	item	of	clothing
away	and	as	we	have	just	discussed	this	is	a	powerful	strategy
because	once	you have	started	doing	the	right	thing	it	is	much	easier	to
continue	doing	it	a	new	habit	should	not	feel	like	a	challenge	the
actions	that	follow	can	be	challenging	but	the	first	two	minutes	should
be	easy	what	you	want	is	a	gateway	habit	that	naturally	leads	you
down	a	more	productive	path

you	can	usually	figure	out	the	gateway	habits	that	will	lead	to	your
desired	outcome	by	mapping	out	your	goals	on	a	scale	from	very	easy
to	very	hard	for	instance	running	a	marathon	is	very	hard	running
a	5k	is	hard	walking	ten	thousand	steps	is	moderately	difficult
walking	ten	minutes	is	easy	and	putting	on	your	running	shoes	is	very
easy	your	goal	might	be	to	run	a	marathon	but	your	gateway	habit	is
to	put	on	your	running	shoes	that is	how	you	follow	the	twominute
rule

people	often	think	its	weird	to	get	hyped	about	reading	one	page	or
meditating	for	one	minute	or	making	one	sales	call	but	the	point	is	not
to	do	one	thing	the	point	is	to	master	the	habit	of	showing	up	the
truth	is	a	habit	must	be	established	before	it	can	be	improved	if	you
cannot	learn	the	basic	skill	of	showing	up	then	you	have	little	hope	of
mastering	the	finer	details	instead	of	trying	to	engineer	a	perfect	habit
from	the	start	do	the	easy	thing	on	a	more	consistent	basis	you	have
to	standardize	before	you	can	optimize

as	you	master	the	art	of	showing	up	the	first	two	minutes	simply
become	a	ritual	at	the	beginning	of	a	larger	routine	this	is	not	merely
a	hack	to	make	habits	easier	but	actually	the	ideal	way	to	master	a
difficult	skill	the	more	you	ritualize	the	beginning	of	a	process	the
more	likely	it	becomes	that	you	can	slip	into	the	state	of	deep	focus
that	is	required	to	do	great	things	by	doing	the	same	warmup	before
every	workout	you	make	it	easier	to	get	into	a	state	of	peak
performance	by	following	the	same	creative	ritual	you	make	it	easier
to	get	into	the	hard	work	of	creating	by	developing	a	consistent
powerdown	habit	you	make	it	easier	to	get	to	bed	at	a	reasonable	time
each	night	you	may	not	be	able	to	automate	the	whole	process	but
you	can	make	the	first	action	mindless	make	it	easy	to	start	and	the
rest	will	follow

the	twominute	rule	can	seem	like	a	trick	to	some	people	you
know	that	the	real	goal	is	to	do	more	than	just	two	minutes	so	it	may
feel	like	you are	trying	to	fool	yourself	nobody	is	actually	aspiring	to
read	one	page	or	do	one	pushup	or	open	their	notes	and	if	you	know
its	a	mental	trick	why	would	you	fall	for	it

if	the	twominute	rule	feels	forced	try	this	do	it	for	two	minutes
and	then	stop	go	for	a	run	but	you	must	stop	after	two	minutes	start
meditating	but	you	must	stop	after	two	minutes	study	arabic	but	you

must	stop	after	two	minutes	its	not	a	strategy	for	starting	its	the
whole	thing	your	habit	can	only	last	one	hundred	and	twenty	seconds

one	of	my	readers	used	this	strategy	to	lose	over	one	hundred
pounds	in	the	beginning	he	went	to	the	gym	each	day	but	he	told
himself	he	was not	allowed	to	stay	for	more	than	five	minutes	he	would
go	to	the	gym	exercise	for	five	minutes	and	leave	as	soon	as	his	time
was	up	after	a	few	weeks	he	looked	around	and	thought	well	i am
always	coming	here	anyway	i	might	as	well	start	staying	a	little
longer	a	few	years	later	the	weight	was	gone

journaling	provides	another	example	nearly	everyone	can	benefit
from	getting	their	thoughts	out	of	their	head	and	onto	paper	but	most
people	give	up	after	a	few	days	or	avoid	it	entirely	because	journaling
feels	like	a	chore	the	secret	is	to	always	stay	below	the	point	where	it
feels	like	work	greg	mckeown	a	leadership	consultant	from	the
united	kingdom	built	a	daily	journaling	habit	by	specifically	writing
less	than	he	felt	like	he	always	stopped	journaling	before	it	seemed
like	a	hassle	ernest	hemingway	believed	in	similar	advice	for	any	kind
of	writing	the	best	way	is	to	always	stop	when	you	are	going	good
he	said

strategies	like	this	work	for	another	reason	too	they	reinforce	the
identity	you	want	to	build	if	you	show	up	at	the	gym	five	days	in	a	row
even	if	its	just	for	two	minutesyou	are	casting	votes	for	your	new
identity	you are	not	worried	about	getting	in	shape	you are	focused	on
becoming	the	type	of	person	who	does not	miss	workouts	you are	taking
the	smallest	action	that	confirms	the	type	of	person	you	want	to	be

we	rarely	think	about	change	this	way	because	everyone	is
consumed	by	the	end	goal	but	one	pushup	is	better	than	not
exercising	one	minute	of	guitar	practice	is	better	than	none	at	all	one
minute	of	reading	is	better	than	never	picking	up	a	book	its	better	to
do	less	than	you	hoped	than	to	do	nothing	at	all

at	some	point	once	you have	established	the	habit	and	you are	showing

up	each	day	you	can	combine	the	twominute	rule	with	a	technique
we	call	habit	shaping	to	scale	your	habit	back	up	toward	your	ultimate
goal	start	by	mastering	the	first	two	minutes	of	the	smallest	version	of
the	behavior	then	advance	to	an	intermediate	step	and	repeat	the
processfocusing	on	just	the	first	two	minutes	and	mastering	that
stage	before	moving	on	to	the	next	level	eventually	you will	end	up	with

the	habit	you	had	originally	hoped	to	build	while	still	keeping	your
focus	where	it	should	be	on	the	first	two	minutes	of	the	behavior

examples	of	habit	shaping

becoming	an	early	riser

phase	1	be	home	by	10	pm	every	night

phase	2	have	all	devices	tv	phone	etc	turned	off	by	10	pm	every	night

phase	3	be	in	bed	by	10	pm	every	night	reading	a	book	talking	with	your	partner

phase	4	lights	off	by	10	pm	every	night

phase	5	wake	up	at	6	am	every	day

phase	1	start	eating	vegetables	at	each	meal

phase	2	stop	eating	animals	with	four	legs	cow	pig	lamb	etc

phase	3	stop	eating	animals	with	two	legs	chicken	turkey	etc

phase	4	stop	eating	animals	with	no	legs	fish	clams	scallops	etc

phase	5	stop	eating	all	animal	products	eggs	milk	cheese

starting	to	exercise

phase	1	change	into	workout	clothes

phase	2	step	out	the	door	try	taking	a	walk

phase	3	drive	to	the	gym	exercise	for	five	minutes	and	leave

phase	4	exercise	for	fifteen	minutes	at	least	once	per	week

phase	5	exercise	three	times	per	week

nearly	any	larger	life	goal	can	be	transformed	into	a	twominute
behavior	i	want	to	live	a	healthy	and	long	life		i	need	to	stay	in	shape
	i	need	to	exercise		i	need	to	change	into	my	workout	clothes	i	want
to	have	a	happy	marriage		i	need	to	be	a	good	partner		i	should	do
something	each	day	to	make	my	partners	life	easier		i	should	meal
plan	for	next	week

whenever	you	are	struggling	to	stick	with	a	habit	you	can	employ

the	twominute	rule	its	a	simple	way	to	make	your	habits	easy

chapter	summary

habits	can	be	completed	in	a	few	seconds	but	continue	to	impact
your	behavior	for	minutes	or	hours	afterward

many	habits	occur	at	decisive	momentschoices	that	are	like	a
fork	in	the	roadand	either	send	you	in	the	direction	of	a

productive	day	or	an	unproductive	one

the	twominute	rule	states	when	you	start	a	new	habit	it
should	take	less	than	two	minutes	to	do

the	more	you	ritualize	the	beginning	of	a	process	the	more	likely
it	becomes	that	you	can	slip	into	the	state	of	deep	focus	that	is

how	to	make	good	habits	inevitable	and
bad	habits	impossible

i

n	the	summer	of	1830	victor	hugo	was	facing	an	impossible	deadline
twelve	months	earlier	the	french	author	had	promised	his
publisher	a	new	book	but	instead	of	writing	he	spent	that	year
pursuing	other	projects	entertaining	guests	and	delaying	his	work
frustrated	hugos	publisher	responded	by	setting	a	deadline	less	than
six	months	away	the	book	had	to	be	finished	by	february	1831

hugo	concocted	a	strange	plan	to	beat	his	procrastination	he
collected	all	of	his	clothes	and	asked	an	assistant	to	lock	them	away	in
a	large	chest	he	was	left	with	nothing	to	wear	except	a	large	shawl
lacking	any	suitable	clothing	to	go	outdoors	he	remained	in	his	study
and	wrote	furiously	during	the	fall	and	winter	of	1830	the	hunchback
of	notre	dame	was	published	two	weeks	early	on	january	14	1831

sometimes	success	is	less	about	making	good	habits	easy	and	more

about	making	bad	habits	hard	this	is	an	inversion	of	the	3rd	law	of
behavior	change	make	it	difficult	if	you	find	yourself	continually
struggling	to	follow	through	on	your	plans	then	you	can	take	a	page
from	victor	hugo	and	make	your	bad	habits	more	difficult	by	creating
what	psychologists	call	a	commitment	device

a	commitment	device	is	a	choice	you	make	in	the	present	that

controls	your	actions	in	the	future	it	is	a	way	to	lock	in	future
behavior	bind	you	to	good	habits	and	restrict	you	from	bad	ones
when	victor	hugo	shut	his	clothes	away	so	he	could	focus	on	writing
he	was	creating	a	commitment	device

there	are	many	ways	to	create	a	commitment	device	you	can
reduce	overeating	by	purchasing	food	in	individual	packages	rather
than	in	bulk	size	you	can	voluntarily	ask	to	be	added	to	the	banned	list
at	casinos	and	online	poker	sites	to	prevent	future	gambling	sprees
i have	even	heard	of	athletes	who	have	to	make	weight	for	a
competition	choosing	to	leave	their	wallets	at	home	during	the	week
before	weighin	so	they	will not	be	tempted	to	buy	fast	food

as	another	example	my	friend	and	fellow	habits	expert	nir	eyal

purchased	an	outlet	timer	which	is	an	adapter	that	he	plugged	in
between	his	internet	router	and	the	power	outlet	at	10	pm	each
night	the	outlet	timer	cuts	off	the	power	to	the	router	when	the
internet	goes	off	everyone	knows	it	is	time	to	go	to	bed

commitment	devices	are	useful	because	they	enable	you	to	take
advantage	of	good	intentions	before	you	can	fall	victim	to	temptation
whenever	i am	looking	to	cut	calories	for	example	i	will	ask	the	waiter
to	split	my	meal	and	box	half	of	it	to	go	before	the	meal	is	served	if	i
waited	until	the	meal	came	out	and	told	myself	ill	just	eat	half	it
would	never	work

the	key	is	to	change	the	task	such	that	it	requires	more	work	to	get

out	of	the	good	habit	than	to	get	started	on	it	if	you are	feeling
motivated	to	get	in	shape	schedule	a	yoga	session	and	pay	ahead	of
time	if	you are	excited	about	the	business	you	want	to	start	email	an

how	to	automate	a	habit	and	never	think	about	it
again

john	henry	patterson	was	born	in	dayton	ohio	in	1844	he	spent	his
childhood	doing	chores	on	the	family	farm	and	working	shifts	at	his
fathers	sawmill	after	attending	college	at	dartmouth	patterson
returned	to	ohio	and	opened	a	small	supply	store	for	coal	miners

it	seemed	like	a	good	opportunity	the	store	faced	little	competition

and	enjoyed	a	steady	stream	of	customers	but	still	struggled	to	make
money	that	was	when	patterson	discovered	his	employees	were
stealing	from	him

in	the	mid1800s	employee	theft	was	a	common	problem	receipts

were	kept	in	an	open	drawer	and	could	easily	be	altered	or	discarded
there	were	no	video	cameras	to	review	behavior	and	no	software	to
track	transactions	unless	you	were	willing	to	hover	over	your
employees	every	minute	of	the	day	or	to	manage	all	transactions
yourself	it	was	difficult	to	prevent	theft

as	patterson	mulled	over	his	predicament	he	came	across	an

advertisement	for	a	new	invention	called	rittys	incorruptible	cashier
designed	by	fellow	dayton	resident	james	ritty	it	was	the	first	cash
register	the	machine	automatically	locked	the	cash	and	receipts	inside
after	each	transaction	patterson	bought	two	for	fifty	dollars	each

employee	theft	at	his	store	vanished	overnight	in	the	next	six
months	pattersons	business	went	from	losing	money	to	making
5000	in	profitthe	equivalent	of	more	than	100000	today

patterson	was	so	impressed	with	the	machine	that	he	changed
businesses	he	bought	the	rights	to	rittys	invention	and	opened	the
national	cash	register	company	ten	years	later	national	cash
register	had	over	one	thousand	employees	and	was	on	its	way	to
becoming	one	of	the	most	successful	businesses	of	its	time

the	best	way	to	break	a	bad	habit	is	to	make	it	impractical	to	do
increase	the	friction	until	you	do not	even	have	the	option	to	act	the
brilliance	of	the	cash	register	was	that	it	automated	ethical	behavior	by
making	stealing	practically	impossible	rather	than	trying	to	change
the	employees	it	made	the	preferred	behavior	automatic

some	actionslike	installing	a	cash	registerpay	off	again	and
again	these	onetime	choices	require	a	little	bit	of	effort	up	front	but
create	increasing	value	over	time	i am	fascinated	by	the	idea	that	a
single	choice	can	deliver	returns	again	and	again	and	i	surveyed	my
readers	on	their	favorite	onetime	actions	that	lead	to	better	longterm
habits	the	table	on	the	following	page	shares	some	of	the	most
popular	answers

id	wager	that	if	the	average	person	were	to	simply	do	half	of	the
onetime	actions	on	this	listeven	if	they	did not	give	another	thought	to

their	habitsmost	would	find	themselves	living	a	better	life	a	year
from	now	these	onetime	actions	are	a	straightforward	way	to	employ
the	3rd	law	of	behavior	change	they	make	it	easier	to	sleep	well	eat
healthy	be	productive	save	money	and	generally	live	better

onetime	actions	that	lock	in	good	habits

nutrition

buy	a	water	filter	to	clean	your	drinking	water

buy	a	supportive	chair	or	standing	desk

enroll	in	an	automatic	savings	plan

set	up	automatic	bill	pay

cut	cable	service

ask	service	providers	to	lower	your	bills

finance

of	course	there	are	many	ways	to	automate	good	habits	and

eliminate	bad	ones	typically	they	involve	putting	technology	to	work
for	you	technology	can	transform	actions	that	were	once	hard
annoying	and	complicated	into	behaviors	that	are	easy	painless	and
simple	it	is	the	most	reliable	and	effective	way	to	guarantee	the	right
behavior

this	is	particularly	useful	for	behaviors	that	happen	too

infrequently	to	become	habitual	things	you	have	to	do	monthly	or
yearlylike	rebalancing	your	investment	portfolioare	never	repeated
frequently	enough	to	become	a	habit	so	they	benefit	in	particular	from
technology	remembering	to	do	them	for	you

other	examples	include

medicine	prescriptions	can	be	automatically	refilled

personal	finance	employees	can	save	for	retirement	with	an
automatic	wage	deduction

cooking	mealdelivery	services	can	do	your	grocery	shopping

productivity	social	media	browsing	can	be	cut	off	with	a	website
blocker

when	you	automate	as	much	of	your	life	as	possible	you	can	spend

your	effort	on	the	tasks	machines	cannot	do	yet	each	habit	that	we
hand	over	to	the	authority	of	technology	frees	up	time	and	energy	to
pour	into	the	next	stage	of	growth	as	mathematician	and	philosopher
alfred	north	whitehead	wrote	civilization	advances	by	extending	the
number	of	operations	we	can	perform	without	thinking	about	them

of	course	the	power	of	technology	can	work	against	us	as	well

bingewatching	becomes	a	habit	because	you	have	to	put	more	effort	in
to	stop	looking	at	the	screen	than	to	continue	doing	so	instead	of
pressing	a	button	to	advance	to	the	next	episode	netflix	or	youtube
will	autoplay	it	for	you	all	you	have	to	do	is	keep	your	eyes	open

technology	creates	a	level	of	convenience	that	enables	you	to	act	on

your	smallest	whims	and	desires	at	the	mere	suggestion	of	hunger
you	can	have	food	delivered	to	your	door	at	the	slightest	hint	of
boredom	you	can	get	lost	in	the	vast	expanse	of	social	media	when
the	effort	required	to	act	on	your	desires	becomes	effectively	zero	you
can	find	yourself	slipping	into	whatever	impulse	arises	at	the	moment
the	downside	of	automation	is	that	we	can	find	ourselves	jumping
from	easy	task	to	easy	task	without	making	time	for	more	difficult	but
ultimately	more	rewarding	work

i	often	find	myself	gravitating	toward	social	media	during	any
downtime	if	i	feel	bored	for	just	a	fraction	of	a	second	i	reach	for	my
phone	its	easy	to	write	off	these	minor	distractions	as	just	taking	a

break	but	over	time	they	can	accumulate	into	a	serious	issue	the
constant	tug	of	just	one	more	minute	can	prevent	me	from	doing
anything	of	consequence	i am	not	the	only	one	the	average	person
spends	over	two	hours	per	day	on	social	media	what	could	you	do
with	an	extra	six	hundred	hours	per	year

during	the	year	i	was	writing	this	book	i	experimented	with	a	new

time	management	strategy	every	monday	my	assistant	would	reset
the	passwords	on	all	my	social	media	accounts	which	logged	me	out
on	each	device	all	week	i	worked	without	distraction	on	friday	she
would	send	me	the	new	passwords	i	had	the	entire	weekend	to	enjoy
what	social	media	had	to	offer	until	monday	morning	when	she	would
do	it	again	if	you	do not	have	an	assistant	team	up	with	a	friend	or
family	member	and	reset	each	others	passwords	each	week

one	of	the	biggest	surprises	was	how	quickly	i	adapted	within	the
first	week	of	locking	myself	out	of	social	media	i	realized	that	i	did not
need	to	check	it	nearly	as	often	as	i	had	been	and	i	certainly	did not
need	it	each	day	it	had	simply	been	so	easy	that	it	had	become	the
default	once	my	bad	habit	became	impossible	i	discovered	that	i	did
actually	have	the	motivation	to	work	on	more	meaningful	tasks	after	i
removed	the	mental	candy	from	my	environment	it	became	much
easier	to	eat	the	healthy	stuff

when	working	in	your	favor	automation	can	make	your	good	habits
inevitable	and	your	bad	habits	impossible	it	is	the	ultimate	way	to	lock
in	future	behavior	rather	than	relying	on	willpower	in	the	moment	by
utilizing	commitment	devices	strategic	onetime	decisions	and
technology	you	can	create	an	environment	of	inevitabilitya	space
where	good	habits	are	not	just	an	outcome	you	hope	for	but	an
outcome	that	is	virtually	guaranteed

the	cardinal	rule	of	behavior	change

i

n	the	late	1990s	a	public	health	worker	named	stephen	luby	left	his
hometown	of	omaha	nebraska	and	bought	a	oneway	ticket	to

karachi	pakistan

karachi	was	one	of	the	most	populous	cities	in	the	world	by	1998
over	nine	million	people	called	it	home	it	was	the	economic	center	of
pakistan	and	a	transportation	hub	with	some	of	the	most	active
airports	and	seaports	in	the	region	in	the	commercial	parts	of	town
you	could	find	all	of	the	standard	urban	amenities	and	bustling
downtown	streets	but	karachi	was	also	one	of	the	least	livable	cities	in
the	world

over	60	percent	of	karachis	residents	lived	in	squatter	settlements

and	slums	these	densely	packed	neighborhoods	were	filled	with
makeshift	houses	cobbled	together	from	old	boards	cinder	blocks	and
other	discarded	materials	there	was	no	waste	removal	system	no
electricity	grid	no	clean	water	supply	when	dry	the	streets	were	a
combination	of	dust	and	trash	when	wet	they	became	a	muddy	pit	of
sewage	mosquito	colonies	thrived	in	pools	of	stagnant	water	and
children	played	among	the	garbage

the	unsanitary	conditions	lead	to	widespread	illness	and	disease
contaminated	water	sources	caused	epidemics	of	diarrhea	vomiting
and	abdominal	pain	nearly	one	third	of	the	children	living	there	were
malnourished	with	so	many	people	crammed	into	such	a	small	space
viruses	and	bacterial	infections	spread	rapidly	it	was	this	public	health
crisis	that	had	brought	stephen	luby	to	pakistan

luby	and	his	team	realized	that	in	an	environment	with	poor
sanitation	the	simple	habit	of	washing	your	hands	could	make	a	real

difference	in	the	health	of	the	residents	but	they	soon	discovered	that
many	people	were	already	aware	that	handwashing	was	important

and	yet	despite	this	knowledge	many	residents	were	washing	their
hands	in	a	haphazard	fashion	some	people	would	just	run	their	hands
under	the	water	quickly	others	would	only	wash	one	hand	many
would	simply	forget	to	wash	their	hands	before	preparing	food
everyone	said	handwashing	was	important	but	few	people	made	a
habit	out	of	it	the	problem	was not	knowledge	the	problem	was
consistency

that	was	when	luby	and	his	team	partnered	with	procter		gamble

to	supply	the	neighborhood	with	safeguard	soap	compared	to	your
standard	bar	of	soap	using	safeguard	was	a	more	enjoyable
experience

in	pakistan	safeguard	was	a	premium	soap	luby	told	me	the
study	participants	commonly	mentioned	how	much	they	liked	it	the
soap	foamed	easily	and	people	were	able	to	lather	their	hands	with
suds	it	smelled	great	instantly	handwashing	became	slightly	more
pleasurable

i	see	the	goal	of	handwashing	promotion	not	as	behavior	change
but	as	habit	adoption	luby	said	it	is	a	lot	easier	for	people	to	adopt
a	product	that	provides	a	strong	positive	sensory	signal	for	example
the	mint	taste	of	toothpaste	than	it	is	to	adopt	a	habit	that	does	not
provide	pleasurable	sensory	feedback	like	flossing	ones	teeth	the
marketing	team	at	procter		gamble	talked	about	trying	to	create	a
positive	handwashing	experience

within	months	the	researchers	saw	a	rapid	shift	in	the	health	of
children	in	the	neighborhood	the	rate	of	diarrhea	fell	by	52	percent
pneumonia	by	48	percent	and	impetigo	a	bacterial	skin	infection	by
35	percent

the	longterm	effects	were	even	better	we	went	back	to	some	of

the	households	in	karachi	six	years	after	luby	told	me	over	95
percent	of	households	who	had	been	given	the	soap	for	free	and
encouraged	to	wash	their	hands	had	a	handwashing	station	with	soap
and	water	available	when	our	study	team	visited				we	had	not	given
any	soap	to	the	intervention	group	for	over	five	years	but	during	the
trial	they	had	become	so	habituated	to	wash	their	hands	that	they	had

maintained	the	practice	it	was	a	powerful	example	of	the	fourth	and
final	law	of	behavior	change	make	it	satisfying

we	are	more	likely	to	repeat	a	behavior	when	the	experience	is
satisfying	this	is	entirely	logical	feelings	of	pleasureeven	minor
ones	like	washing	your	hands	with	soap	that	smells	nice	and	lathers
wellare	signals	that	tell	the	brain	this	feels	good	do	this	again
next	time	pleasure	teaches	your	brain	that	a	behavior	is	worth
remembering	and	repeating

take	the	story	of	chewing	gum	chewing	gum	had	been	sold
commercially	throughout	the	1800s	but	it	was not	until	wrigley
launched	in	1891	that	it	became	a	worldwide	habit	early	versions	were
made	from	relatively	bland	resinschewy	but	not	tasty	wrigley
revolutionized	the	industry	by	adding	flavors	like	spearmint	and	juicy
fruit	which	made	the	product	flavorful	and	fun	to	use	then	they	went
a	step	further	and	began	pushing	chewing	gum	as	a	pathway	to	a	clean
mouth	advertisements	told	readers	to	refresh	your	taste

tasty	flavors	and	the	feeling	of	a	fresh	mouth	provided	little	bits	of

immediate	reinforcement	and	made	the	product	satisfying	to	use
consumption	skyrocketed	and	wrigley	became	the	largest	chewing
gum	company	in	the	world

toothpaste	had	a	similar	trajectory	manufacturers	enjoyed	great

success	when	they	added	flavors	like	spearmint	peppermint	and
cinnamon	to	their	products	these	flavors	do not	improve	the
effectiveness	of	toothpaste	they	simply	create	a	clean	mouth	feel
and	make	the	experience	of	brushing	your	teeth	more	pleasurable	my
wife	actually	stopped	using	sensodyne	because	she	did not	like	the
aftertaste	she	switched	to	a	brand	with	a	stronger	mint	flavor	which
proved	to	be	more	satisfying

conversely	if	an	experience	is	not	satisfying	we	have	little	reason	to

repeat	it	in	my	research	i	came	across	the	story	of	a	woman	who	had
a	narcissistic	relative	who	drove	her	nuts	in	an	attempt	to	spend	less
time	with	this	egomaniac	she	acted	as	dull	and	as	boring	as	possible
whenever	he	was	around	within	a	few	encounters	he	started	avoiding
her	because	he	found	her	so	uninteresting

stories	like	these	are	evidence	of	the	cardinal	rule	of	behavior
change	what	is	rewarded	is	repeated	what	is	punished	is	avoided
you	learn	what	to	do	in	the	future	based	on	what	you	were	rewarded

for	doing	or	punished	for	doing	in	the	past	positive	emotions
cultivate	habits	negative	emotions	destroy	them

the	first	three	laws	of	behavior	changemake	it	obvious	make	it
attractive	and	make	it	easyincrease	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	be
performed	this	time	the	fourth	law	of	behavior	changemake	it
satisfyingincreases	the	odds	that	a	behavior	will	be	repeated	next
time	it	completes	the	habit	loop

but	there	is	a	trick	we	are	not	looking	for	just	any	type	of

satisfaction	we	are	looking	for	immediate	satisfaction

the	mismatch	between	immediate	and	delayed
rewards

imagine	you are	an	animal	roaming	the	plains	of	africaa	giraffe	or	an
elephant	or	a	lion	on	any	given	day	most	of	your	decisions	have	an
immediate	impact	you	are	always	thinking	about	what	to	eat	or	where
to	sleep	or	how	to	avoid	a	predator	you	are	constantly	focused	on	the
present	or	the	very	near	future	you	live	in	what	scientists	call	an
immediatereturn	environment	because	your	actions	instantly	deliver
clear	and	immediate	outcomes

now	switch	back	to	your	human	self	in	modern	society	many	of
the	choices	you	make	today	will	not	benefit	you	immediately	if	you	do
a	good	job	at	work	you will	get	a	paycheck	in	a	few	weeks	if	you	exercise
today	perhaps	you	will not	be	overweight	next	year	if	you	save	money
now	maybe	you will	have	enough	for	retirement	decades	from	now	you
live	in	what	scientists	call	a	delayedreturn	environment	because	you
can	work	for	years	before	your	actions	deliver	the	intended	payoff

the	human	brain	did	not	evolve	for	life	in	a	delayedreturn
environment	the	earliest	remains	of	modern	humans	known	as
homo	sapiens	sapiens	are	approximately	two	hundred	thousand	years
old	these	were	the	first	humans	to	have	a	brain	relatively	similar	to
ours	in	particular	the	neocortexthe	newest	part	of	the	brain	and	the
region	responsible	for	higher	functions	like	languagewas	roughly	the
same	size	two	hundred	thousand	years	ago	as	today	you	are	walking
around	with	the	same	hardware	as	your	paleolithic	ancestors

it	is	only	recentlyduring	the	last	five	hundred	years	or	sothat
society	has	shifted	to	a	predominantly	delayedreturn	environment

compared	to	the	age	of	the	brain	modern	society	is	brandnew	in	the
last	one	hundred	years	we	have	seen	the	rise	of	the	car	the	airplane
the	television	the	personal	computer	the	internet	the	smartphone
and	beyonce	the	world	has	changed	much	in	recent	years	but	human
nature	has	changed	little

similar	to	other	animals	on	the	african	savannah	our	ancestors
spent	their	days	responding	to	grave	threats	securing	the	next	meal
and	taking	shelter	from	a	storm	it	made	sense	to	place	a	high	value	on
instant	gratification	the	distant	future	was	less	of	a	concern	and	after
thousands	of	generations	in	an	immediatereturn	environment	our
brains	evolved	to	prefer	quick	payoffs	to	longterm	ones

behavioral	economists	refer	to	this	tendency	as	time	inconsistency

that	is	the	way	your	brain	evaluates	rewards	is	inconsistent	across
time	you	value	the	present	more	than	the	future	usually	this
tendency	serves	us	well	a	reward	that	is	certain	right	now	is	typically
worth	more	than	one	that	is	merely	possible	in	the	future	but
occasionally	our	bias	toward	instant	gratification	causes	problems

why	would	someone	smoke	if	they	know	it	increases	the	risk	of	lung
cancer	why	would	someone	overeat	when	they	know	it	increases	their
risk	of	obesity	why	would	someone	have	unsafe	sex	if	they	know	it
can	result	in	sexually	transmitted	disease	once	you	understand	how
the	brain	prioritizes	rewards	the	answers	become	clear	the
consequences	of	bad	habits	are	delayed	while	the	rewards	are
immediate	smoking	might	kill	you	in	ten	years	but	it	reduces	stress
and	eases	your	nicotine	cravings	now	overeating	is	harmful	in	the
long	run	but	appetizing	in	the	moment	sexsafe	or	notprovides
pleasure	right	away	disease	and	infection	will not	show	up	for	days	or
weeks	even	years

every	habit	produces	multiple	outcomes	across	time	unfortunately

these	outcomes	are	often	misaligned	with	our	bad	habits	the
immediate	outcome	usually	feels	good	but	the	ultimate	outcome	feels
bad	with	good	habits	it	is	the	reverse	the	immediate	outcome	is
unenjoyable	but	the	ultimate	outcome	feels	good	the	french
economist	frederic	bastiat	explained	the	problem	clearly	when	he
wrote	it	almost	always	happens	that	when	the	immediate
consequence	is	favorable	the	later	consequences	are	disastrous	and
vice	versa				often	the	sweeter	the	first	fruit	of	a	habit	the	more
bitter	are	its	later	fruits

put	another	way	the	costs	of	your	good	habits	are	in	the	present

the	costs	of	your	bad	habits	are	in	the	future

the	brains	tendency	to	prioritize	the	present	moment	means	you
cannot	rely	on	good	intentions	when	you	make	a	planto	lose	weight
write	a	book	or	learn	a	languageyou	are	actually	making	plans	for
your	future	self	and	when	you	envision	what	you	want	your	life	to	be
like	it	is	easy	to	see	the	value	in	taking	actions	with	longterm	benefits
we	all	want	better	lives	for	our	future	selves	however	when	the
moment	of	decision	arrives	instant	gratification	usually	wins	you	are
no	longer	making	a	choice	for	future	you	who	dreams	of	being	fitter
or	wealthier	or	happier	you	are	choosing	for	present	you	who	wants
to	be	full	pampered	and	entertained	as	a	general	rule	the	more
immediate	pleasure	you	get	from	an	action	the	more	strongly	you
should	question	whether	it	aligns	with	your	longterm	goals

with	a	fuller	understanding	of	what	causes	our	brain	to	repeat	some
behaviors	and	avoid	others	let us	update	the	cardinal	rule	of	behavior
change	what	is	immediately	rewarded	is	repeated	what	is
immediately	punished	is	avoided

our	preference	for	instant	gratification	reveals	an	important	truth
about	success	because	of	how	we	are	wired	most	people	will	spend	all
day	chasing	quick	hits	of	satisfaction	the	road	less	traveled	is	the	road
of	delayed	gratification	if	you are	willing	to	wait	for	the	rewards	you will
face	less	competition	and	often	get	a	bigger	payoff	as	the	saying	goes
the	last	mile	is	always	the	least	crowded

this	is	precisely	what	research	has	shown	people	who	are	better	at
delaying	gratification	have	higher	sat	scores	lower	levels	of	substance
abuse	lower	likelihood	of	obesity	better	responses	to	stress	and
superior	social	skills	we have	all	seen	this	play	out	in	our	own	lives	if
you	delay	watching	television	and	get	your	homework	done	you will
generally	learn	more	and	get	better	grades	if	you	do not	buy	desserts
and	chips	at	the	store	you will	often	eat	healthier	food	when	you	get
home	at	some	point	success	in	nearly	every	field	requires	you	to
ignore	an	immediate	reward	in	favor	of	a	delayed	reward

here is	the	problem	most	people	know	that	delaying	gratification	is

the	wise	approach	they	want	the	benefits	of	good	habits	to	be
healthy	productive	at	peace	but	these	outcomes	are	seldom	topof
mind	at	the	decisive	moment	thankfully	its	possible	to	train	yourself
to	delay	gratificationbut	you	need	to	work	with	the	grain	of	human

nature	not	against	it	the	best	way	to	do	this	is	to	add	a	little	bit	of
immediate	pleasure	to	the	habits	that	pay	off	in	the	longrun	and	a
little	bit	of	immediate	pain	to	ones	that	do not

how	to	turn	instant	gratification	to	your	advantage

the	vital	thing	in	getting	a	habit	to	stick	is	to	feel	successfuleven	if
its	in	a	small	way	the	feeling	of	success	is	a	signal	that	your	habit	paid
off	and	that	the	work	was	worth	the	effort

in	a	perfect	world	the	reward	for	a	good	habit	is	the	habit	itself	in
the	real	world	good	habits	tend	to	feel	worthwhile	only	after	they	have
provided	you	with	something	early	on	its	all	sacrifice	you have	gone	to
the	gym	a	few	times	but	you are	not	stronger	or	fitter	or	fasterat	least
not	in	any	noticeable	sense	its	only	months	later	once	you	she would	a	few
pounds	or	your	arms	gain	some	definition	that	it	becomes	easier	to
exercise	for	its	own	sake	in	the	beginning	you	need	a	reason	to	stay
on	track	this	is	why	immediate	rewards	are	essential	they	keep	you
excited	while	the	delayed	rewards	accumulate	in	the	background

what	were	really	talking	about	herewhen	were	discussing
immediate	rewardsis	the	ending	of	a	behavior	the	ending	of	any
experience	is	vital	because	we	tend	to	remember	it	more	than	other
phases	you	want	the	ending	of	your	habit	to	be	satisfying	the	best
approach	is	to	use	reinforcement	which	refers	to	the	process	of	using
an	immediate	reward	to	increase	the	rate	of	a	behavior	habit	stacking
which	we	covered	in	chapter	5	ties	your	habit	to	an	immediate	cue
which	makes	it	obvious	when	to	start	reinforcement	ties	your	habit	to
an	immediate	reward	which	makes	it	satisfying	when	you	finish

immediate	reinforcement	can	be	especially	helpful	when	dealing
with	habits	of	avoidance	which	are	behaviors	you	want	to	stop	doing
it	can	be	challenging	to	stick	with	habits	like	no	frivolous	purchases
or	no	alcohol	this	month	because	nothing	happens	when	you	skip
happy	hour	drinks	or	do not	buy	that	pair	of	shoes	it	can	be	hard	to	feel
satisfied	when	there	is	no	action	in	the	first	place	all	you are	doing	is
resisting	temptation	and	there	is not	much	satisfying	about	that

one	solution	is	to	turn	the	situation	on	its	head	you	want	to	make

avoidance	visible	open	a	savings	account	and	label	it	for	something
you	wantmaybe	leather	jacket	whenever	you	pass	on	a	purchase
put	the	same	amount	of	money	in	the	account	skip	your	morning

latte	transfer	5	pass	on	another	month	of	netflix	move	10	over
its	like	creating	a	loyalty	program	for	yourself	the	immediate	reward
of	seeing	yourself	save	money	toward	the	leather	jacket	feels	a	lot
better	than	being	deprived	you	are	making	it	satisfying	to	do	nothing

one	of	my	readers	and	his	wife	used	a	similar	setup	they	wanted	to
stop	eating	out	so	much	and	start	cooking	together	more	they	labeled
their	savings	account	trip	to	europe	whenever	they	skipped	going
out	to	eat	they	transferred	50	into	the	account	at	the	end	of	the	year
they	put	the	money	toward	the	vacation

it	is	worth	noting	that	it	is	important	to	select	shortterm	rewards

that	reinforce	your	identity	rather	than	ones	that	conflict	with	it
buying	a	new	jacket	is	fine	if	you are	trying	to	lose	weight	or	read	more
books	but	it	does not	work	if	you are	trying	to	budget	and	save	money
instead	taking	a	bubble	bath	or	going	on	a	leisurely	walk	are	good
examples	of	rewarding	yourself	with	free	time	which	aligns	with	your
ultimate	goal	of	more	freedom	and	financial	independence	similarly
if	your	reward	for	exercising	is	eating	a	bowl	of	ice	cream	then	you are
casting	votes	for	conflicting	identities	and	it	ends	up	being	a	wash
instead	maybe	your	reward	is	a	massage	which	is	both	a	luxury	and	a
vote	toward	taking	care	of	your	body	now	the	shortterm	reward	is
aligned	with	your	longterm	vision	of	being	a	healthy	person

eventually	as	intrinsic	rewards	like	a	better	mood	more	energy
and	reduced	stress	kick	in	you will	become	less	concerned	with	chasing
the	secondary	reward	the	identity	itself	becomes	the	reinforcer	you
do	it	because	its	who	you	are	and	it	feels	good	to	be	you	the	more	a
habit	becomes	part	of	your	life	the	less	you	need	outside
encouragement	to	follow	through	incentives	can	start	a	habit	identity
sustains	a	habit

that	said	it	takes	time	for	the	evidence	to	accumulate	and	a	new

identity	to	emerge	immediate	reinforcement	helps	maintain
motivation	in	the	short	term	while	you are	waiting	for	the	longterm
rewards	to	arrive

in	summary	a	habit	needs	to	be	enjoyable	for	it	to	last	simple	bits
of	reinforcementlike	soap	that	smells	great	or	toothpaste	that	has	a
refreshing	mint	flavor	or	seeing	50	hit	your	savings	accountcan
offer	the	immediate	pleasure	you	need	to	enjoy	a	habit	and	change	is
easy	when	it	is	enjoyable

how	to	stick	with	good	habits	every	day

i

n	1993	a	bank	in	abbotsford	canada	hired	a	twentythreeyearold
stockbroker	named	trent	dyrsmid	abbotsford	was	a	relatively	small

suburb	tucked	away	in	the	shadow	of	nearby	vancouver	where	most
of	the	big	business	deals	were	being	made	given	the	location	and	the
fact	that	dyrsmid	was	a	rookie	nobody	expected	too	much	of	him	but
he	made	brisk	progress	thanks	to	a	simple	daily	habit

dyrsmid	began	each	morning	with	two	jars	on	his	desk	one	was
filled	with	120	paper	clips	the	other	was	empty	as	soon	as	he	settled
in	each	day	he	would	make	a	sales	call	immediately	after	he	would
move	one	paper	clip	from	the	full	jar	to	the	empty	jar	and	the	process
would	begin	again	every	morning	i	would	start	with	120	paper	clips
in	one	jar	and	i	would	keep	dialing	the	phone	until	i	had	moved	them
all	to	the	second	jar	he	told	me

within	eighteen	months	dyrsmid	was	bringing	in	5	million	to	the

firm	by	age	twentyfour	he	was	making	75000	per	yearthe
equivalent	of	125000	today	not	long	after	he	landed	a	sixfigure	job
with	another	company

i	like	to	refer	to	this	technique	as	the	paper	clip	strategy	and	over
the	years	i have	heard	from	readers	who	have	employed	it	in	a	variety	of
ways	one	woman	shifted	a	hairpin	from	one	container	to	another
whenever	she	wrote	a	page	of	her	book	another	man	moved	a	marble
from	one	bin	to	the	next	after	each	set	of	pushups

making	progress	is	satisfying	and	visual	measureslike	moving

paper	clips	or	hairpins	or	marblesprovide	clear	evidence	of	your
progress	as	a	result	they	reinforce	your	behavior	and	add	a	little	bit	of
immediate	satisfaction	to	any	activity	visual	measurement	comes	in

many	forms	food	journals	workout	logs	loyalty	punch	cards	the
progress	bar	on	a	software	download	even	the	page	numbers	in	a
book	but	perhaps	the	best	way	to	measure	your	progress	is	with	a
habit	tracker

how	to	keep	your	habits	on	track

a	habit	tracker	is	a	simple	way	to	measure	whether	you	did	a	habit
the	most	basic	format	is	to	get	a	calendar	and	cross	off	each	day	you
stick	with	your	routine	for	example	if	you	meditate	on	monday
wednesday	and	friday	each	of	those	dates	gets	an	x	as	time	rolls	by
the	calendar	becomes	a	record	of	your	habit	streak

countless	people	have	tracked	their	habits	but	perhaps	the	most

famous	was	benjamin	franklin	beginning	at	age	twenty	franklin
carried	a	small	booklet	everywhere	he	went	and	used	it	to	track
thirteen	personal	virtues	this	list	included	goals	like	lose	no	time	be
always	employed	in	something	useful	and	avoid	trifling
conversation	at	the	end	of	each	day	franklin	would	open	his	booklet
and	record	his	progress

jerry	seinfeld	reportedly	uses	a	habit	tracker	to	stick	with	his	streak

of	writing	jokes	in	the	documentary	comedian	he	explains	that	his
goal	is	simply	to	never	break	the	chain	of	writing	jokes	every	day	in
other	words	he	is	not	focused	on	how	good	or	bad	a	particular	joke	is
or	how	inspired	he	feels	he	is	simply	focused	on	showing	up	and
adding	to	his	streak

do not	break	the	chain	is	a	powerful	mantra	do not	break	the	chain
of	sales	calls	and	you will	build	a	successful	book	of	business	do not	break
the	chain	of	workouts	and	you will	get	fit	faster	than	you would	expect	do not
break	the	chain	of	creating	every	day	and	you	will	end	up	with	an
impressive	portfolio	habit	tracking	is	powerful	because	it	leverages
multiple	laws	of	behavior	change	it	simultaneously	makes	a	behavior
obvious	attractive	and	satisfying

let us	break	down	each	one

benefit	1	habit	tracking	is	obvious

recording	your	last	action	creates	a	trigger	that	can	initiate	your	next
one	habit	tracking	naturally	builds	a	series	of	visual	cues	like	the
streak	of	xs	on	your	calendar	or	the	list	of	meals	in	your	food	log
when	you	look	at	the	calendar	and	see	your	streak	you will	be	reminded
to	act	again	research	has	shown	that	people	who	track	their	progress
on	goals	like	losing	weight	quitting	smoking	and	lowering	blood
pressure	are	all	more	likely	to	improve	than	those	who	do not	one
study	of	more	than	sixteen	hundred	people	found	that	those	who	kept
a	daily	food	log	lost	twice	as	much	weight	as	those	who	did	not	the
mere	act	of	tracking	a	behavior	can	spark	the	urge	to	change	it

habit	tracking	also	keeps	you	honest	most	of	us	have	a	distorted

view	of	our	own	behavior	we	think	we	act	better	than	we	do
measurement	offers	one	way	to	overcome	our	blindness	to	our	own
behavior	and	notice	what is	really	going	on	each	day	one	glance	at	the
paper	clips	in	the	container	and	you	immediately	know	how	much
work	you	have	or	have not	been	putting	in	when	the	evidence	is	right
in	front	of	you	you are	less	likely	to	lie	to	yourself

benefit	2	habit	tracking	is	attractive

the	most	effective	form	of	motivation	is	progress	when	we	get	a
signal	that	we	are	moving	forward	we	become	more	motivated	to
continue	down	that	path	in	this	way	habit	tracking	can	have	an
addictive	effect	on	motivation	each	small	win	feeds	your	desire

this	can	be	particularly	powerful	on	a	bad	day	when	you are	feeling
down	its	easy	to	forget	about	all	the	progress	you	have	already	made
habit	tracking	provides	visual	proof	of	your	hard	worka	subtle
reminder	of	how	far	you have	come	plus	the	empty	square	you	see	each
morning	can	motivate	you	to	get	started	because	you	do not	want	to	lose
your	progress	by	breaking	the	streak

benefit	3	habit	tracking	is	satisfying

this	is	the	most	crucial	benefit	of	all	tracking	can	become	its	own
form	of	reward	it	is	satisfying	to	cross	an	item	off	your	todo	list	to
complete	an	entry	in	your	workout	log	or	to	mark	an	x	on	the
calendar	it	feels	good	to	watch	your	results	growthe	size	of	your

investment	portfolio	the	length	of	your	book	manuscriptand	if	it
feels	good	then	you are	more	likely	to	endure

habit	tracking	also	helps	keep	your	eye	on	the	ball	you are	focused
on	the	process	rather	than	the	result	you are	not	fixated	on	getting	six
pack	abs	you are	just	trying	to	keep	the	streak	alive	and	become	the
type	of	person	who	does not	miss	workouts

in	summary	habit	tracking	1	creates	a	visual	cue	that	can	remind

you	to	act	2	is	inherently	motivating	because	you	see	the	progress
you	are	making	and	do not	want	to	lose	it	and	3	feels	satisfying
whenever	you	record	another	successful	instance	of	your	habit
furthermore	habit	tracking	provides	visual	proof	that	you	are	casting
votes	for	the	type	of	person	you	wish	to	become	which	is	a	delightful
form	of	immediate	and	intrinsic	gratification

you	may	be	wondering	if	habit	tracking	is	so	useful	why	have	i

waited	so	long	to	talk	about	it

despite	all	the	benefits	i have	left	this	discussion	until	now	for	a
simple	reason	many	people	resist	the	idea	of	tracking	and	measuring
it	can	feel	like	a	burden	because	it	forces	you	into	two	habits	the	habit
you are	trying	to	build	and	the	habit	of	tracking	it	counting	calories
sounds	like	a	hassle	when	you are	already	struggling	to	follow	a	diet
writing	down	every	sales	call	seems	tedious	when	you have	got	work	to
do	it	feels	easier	to	say	ill	just	eat	less	or	ill	try	harder	or	ill
remember	to	do	it	people	inevitably	tell	me	things	like	i	have	a
decision	journal	but	i	wish	i	used	it	more	or	i	recorded	my
workouts	for	a	week	but	then	quit	i have	been	there	myself	i	once
made	a	food	log	to	track	my	calories	i	managed	to	do	it	for	one	meal
and	then	gave	up

tracking	is not	for	everyone	and	there	is	no	need	to	measure	your
entire	life	but	nearly	anyone	can	benefit	from	it	in	some	formeven	if
its	only	temporary

what	can	we	do	to	make	tracking	easier

first	whenever	possible	measurement	should	be	automated	you will

probably	be	surprised	by	how	much	you are	already	tracking	without
knowing	it	your	credit	card	statement	tracks	how	often	you	go	out	to
eat	your	fitbit	registers	how	many	steps	you	take	and	how	long	you
sleep	your	calendar	records	how	many	new	places	you	travel	to	each
year	once	you	know	where	to	get	the	data	add	a	note	to	your	calendar

to	review	it	each	week	or	each	month	which	is	more	practical	than
tracking	it	every	day

second	manual	tracking	should	be	limited	to	your	most	important
habits	it	is	better	to	consistently	track	one	habit	than	to	sporadically
track	ten

finally	record	each	measurement	immediately	after	the	habit

occurs	the	completion	of	the	behavior	is	the	cue	to	write	it	down	this
approach	allows	you	to	combine	the	habitstacking	method	mentioned
in	chapter	5	with	habit	tracking

the	habit	stacking		habit	tracking	formula	is

after	current	habit	i	will	track	my	habit

after	i	hang	up	the	phone	from	a	sales	call	i	will	move	one	paper
clip	over

after	i	finish	each	set	at	the	gym	i	will	record	it	in	my	workout
journal

after	i	put	my	plate	in	the	dishwasher	i	will	write	down	what	i
ate

these	tactics	can	make	tracking	your	habits	easier	even	if	you
are not	the	type	of	person	who	enjoys	recording	your	behavior	i	think
you will	find	a	few	weeks	of	measurements	to	be	insightful	its	always
interesting	to	see	how	you have	actually	been	spending	your	time

that	said	every	habit	streak	ends	at	some	point	and	more
important	than	any	single	measurement	is	having	a	good	plan	for
when	your	habits	slide	off	track

how	to	recover	quickly	when	your	habits	break
down

no	matter	how	consistent	you	are	with	your	habits	it	is	inevitable	that
life	will	interrupt	you	at	some	point	perfection	is	not	possible	before
long	an	emergency	will	pop	upyou	get	sick	or	you	have	to	travel	for
work	or	your	family	needs	a	little	more	of	your	time

whenever	this	happens	to	me	i	try	to	remind	myself	of	a	simple

rule	never	miss	twice

if	i	miss	one	day	i	try	to	get	back	into	it	as	quickly	as	possible
missing	one	workout	happens	but	i am	not	going	to	miss	two	in	a	row
maybe	ill	eat	an	entire	pizza	but	ill	follow	it	up	with	a	healthy	meal	i
cannot	be	perfect	but	i	can	avoid	a	second	lapse	as	soon	as	one	streak
ends	i	get	started	on	the	next	one

the	first	mistake	is	never	the	one	that	ruins	you	it	is	the	spiral	of
repeated	mistakes	that	follows	missing	once	is	an	accident	missing
twice	is	the	start	of	a	new	habit

this	is	a	distinguishing	feature	between	winners	and	losers	anyone
can	have	a	bad	performance	a	bad	workout	or	a	bad	day	at	work	but
when	successful	people	fail	they	rebound	quickly	the	breaking	of	a
habit	does not	matter	if	the	reclaiming	of	it	is	fast

i	think	this	principle	is	so	important	that	ill	stick	to	it	even	if	i	cannot

do	a	habit	as	well	or	as	completely	as	i	would	like	too	often	we	fall
into	an	allornothing	cycle	with	our	habits	the	problem	is	not
slipping	up	the	problem	is	thinking	that	if	you	cannot	do	something
perfectly	then	you	should not	do	it	at	all

you	do not	realize	how	valuable	it	is	to	just	show	up	on	your	bad	or
busy	days	lost	days	hurt	you	more	than	successful	days	help	you	if
you	start	with	100	then	a	50	percent	gain	will	take	you	to	150	but
you	only	need	a	33	percent	loss	to	take	you	back	to	100	in	other
words	avoiding	a	33	percent	loss	is	just	as	valuable	as	achieving	a	50
percent	gain	as	charlie	munger	says	the	first	rule	of	compounding
never	interrupt	it	unnecessarily

this	is	why	the	bad	workouts	are	often	the	most	important	ones

sluggish	days	and	bad	workouts	maintain	the	compound	gains	you
accrued	from	previous	good	days	simply	doing	somethingten
squats	five	sprints	a	pushup	anything	reallyis	huge	do not	put	up	a
zero	do not	let	losses	eat	into	your	compounding

furthermore	its	not	always	about	what	happens	during	the

workout	its	about	being	the	type	of	person	who	does not	miss
workouts	its	easy	to	train	when	you	feel	good	but	its	crucial	to	show
up	when	you	do not	feel	like	iteven	if	you	do	less	than	you	hope	going
to	the	gym	for	five	minutes	may	not	improve	your	performance	but	it
reaffirms	your	identity

the	allornothing	cycle	of	behavior	change	is	just	one	pitfall	that
can	derail	your	habits	another	potential	dangerespecially	if	you	are

using	a	habit	trackeris	measuring	the	wrong	thing

knowing	when	and	when	not	to	track	a	habit

say	you are	running	a	restaurant	and	you	want	to	know	if	your	chef	is
doing	a	good	job	one	way	to	measure	success	is	to	track	how	many
customers	pay	for	a	meal	each	day	if	more	customers	come	in	the
food	must	be	good	if	fewer	customers	come	in	something	must	be
wrong

however	this	one	measurementdaily	revenueonly	gives	a
limited	picture	of	what is	really	going	on	just	because	someone	pays
for	a	meal	does not	mean	they	enjoy	the	meal	even	dissatisfied
customers	are	unlikely	to	dine	and	dash	in	fact	if	you are	only
measuring	revenue	the	food	might	be	getting	worse	but	you are	making
up	for	it	with	marketing	or	discounts	or	some	other	method	instead	it
may	be	more	effective	to	track	how	many	customers	finish	their	meal
or	perhaps	the	percentage	of	customers	who	leave	a	generous	tip

the	dark	side	of	tracking	a	particular	behavior	is	that	we	become

driven	by	the	number	rather	than	the	purpose	behind	it	if	your
success	is	measured	by	quarterly	earnings	you	will	optimize	sales
revenue	and	accounting	for	quarterly	earnings	if	your	success	is
measured	by	a	lower	number	on	the	scale	you	will	optimize	for	a	lower
number	on	the	scale	even	if	that	means	embracing	crash	diets	juice
cleanses	and	fatloss	pills	the	human	mind	wants	to	win	whatever
game	is	being	played

this	pitfall	is	evident	in	many	areas	of	life	we	focus	on	working
long	hours	instead	of	getting	meaningful	work	done	we	care	more
about	getting	ten	thousand	steps	than	we	do	about	being	healthy	we
teach	for	standardized	tests	instead	of	emphasizing	learning	curiosity
and	critical	thinking	in	short	we	optimize	for	what	we	measure	when
we	choose	the	wrong	measurement	we	get	the	wrong	behavior

this	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	goodharts	law	named	after	the
economist	charles	goodhart	the	principle	states	when	a	measure
becomes	a	target	it	ceases	to	be	a	good	measure	measurement	is	only
useful	when	it	guides	you	and	adds	context	to	a	larger	picture	not
when	it	consumes	you	each	number	is	simply	one	piece	of	feedback	in
the	overall	system

in	our	datadriven	world	we	tend	to	overvalue	numbers	and
undervalue	anything	ephemeral	soft	and	difficult	to	quantify	we
mistakenly	think	the	factors	we	can	measure	are	the	only	factors	that
exist	but	just	because	you	can	measure	something	does not	mean	its
the	most	important	thing	and	just	because	you	cannot	measure
something	does not	mean	its	not	important	at	all

all	of	this	to	say	its	crucial	to	keep	habit	tracking	in	its	proper
place	it	can	feel	satisfying	to	record	a	habit	and	track	your	progress
but	the	measurement	is	not	the	only	thing	that	matters	furthermore
there	are	many	ways	to	measure	progress	and	sometimes	it	helps	to
shift	your	focus	to	something	entirely	different

this	is	why	nonscale	victories	can	be	effective	for	weight	loss	the

number	on	the	scale	may	be	stubborn	so	if	you	focus	solely	on	that
number	your	motivation	will	sag	but	you	may	notice	that	your	skin
looks	better	or	you	wake	up	earlier	or	your	sex	drive	got	a	boost	all	of
these	are	valid	ways	to	track	your	improvement	if	you are	not	feeling
motivated	by	the	number	on	the	scale	perhaps	its	time	to	focus	on	a
different	measurementone	that	gives	you	more	signals	of	progress

no	matter	how	you	measure	your	improvement	habit	tracking

offers	a	simple	way	to	make	your	habits	more	satisfying	each
measurement	provides	a	little	bit	of	evidence	that	you are	moving	in	the
right	direction	and	a	brief	moment	of	immediate	pleasure	for	a	job	well
done

chapter	summary

one	of	the	most	satisfying	feelings	is	the	feeling	of	making
progress

a	habit	tracker	is	a	simple	way	to	measure	whether	you	did	a
habitlike	marking	an	x	on	a	calendar

habit	trackers	and	other	visual	forms	of	measurement	can	make
your	habits	satisfying	by	providing	clear	evidence	of	your
progress

do not	break	the	chain	try	to	keep	your	habit	streak	alive

never	miss	twice	if	you	miss	one	day	try	to	get	back	on	track	as
quickly	as	possible

just	because	you	can	measure	something	does not	mean	its	the

how	an	accountability	partner	can
change	everything

a

fter	serving	as	a	pilot	in	world	war	ii	roger	fisher	attended
harvard	law	school	and	spent	thirtyfour	years	specializing	in

negotiation	and	conflict	management	he	founded	the	harvard
negotiation	project	and	worked	with	numerous	countries	and	world
leaders	on	peace	resolutions	hostage	crises	and	diplomatic
compromises	but	it	was	in	the	1970s	and	1980s	as	the	threat	of
nuclear	war	escalated	that	fisher	developed	perhaps	his	most
interesting	idea

at	the	time	fisher	was	focused	on	designing	strategies	that	could
prevent	nuclear	war	and	he	had	noticed	a	troubling	fact	any	sitting
president	would	have	access	to	launch	codes	that	could	kill	millions	of
people	but	would	never	actually	see	anyone	die	because	he	would
always	be	thousands	of	miles	away

my	suggestion	was	quite	simple	he	wrote	in	1981	put	that
nuclear	code	number	in	a	little	capsule	and	then	implant	that
capsule	right	next	to	the	heart	of	a	volunteer	the	volunteer	would
carry	with	him	a	big	heavy	butcher	knife	as	he	accompanied	the
president	if	ever	the	president	wanted	to	fire	nuclear	weapons	the
only	way	he	could	do	so	would	be	for	him	first	with	his	own	hands	to
kill	one	human	being	the	president	says	george	i am	sorry	but	tens
of	millions	must	die	he	has	to	look	at	someone	and	realize	what	death
iswhat	an	innocent	death	is	blood	on	the	white	house	carpet	its
reality	brought	home

when	i	suggested	this	to	friends	in	the	pentagon	they	said	my

god	that is	terrible	having	to	kill	someone	would	distort	the
presidents	judgment	he	might	never	push	the	button

throughout	our	discussion	of	the	4th	law	of	behavior	change	we

have	covered	the	importance	of	making	good	habits	immediately
satisfying	fishers	proposal	is	an	inversion	of	the	4th	law	make	it
immediately	unsatisfying

just	as	we	are	more	likely	to	repeat	an	experience	when	the	ending

is	satisfying	we	are	also	more	likely	to	avoid	an	experience	when	the
ending	is	painful	pain	is	an	effective	teacher	if	a	failure	is	painful	it
gets	fixed	if	a	failure	is	relatively	painless	it	gets	ignored	the	more
immediate	and	more	costly	a	mistake	is	the	faster	you	will	learn	from
it	the	threat	of	a	bad	review	forces	a	plumber	to	be	good	at	his	job
the	possibility	of	a	customer	never	returning	makes	restaurants	create
good	food	the	cost	of	cutting	the	wrong	blood	vessel	makes	a	surgeon
master	human	anatomy	and	cut	carefully	when	the	consequences	are
severe	people	learn	quickly

the	more	immediate	the	pain	the	less	likely	the	behavior	if	you
want	to	prevent	bad	habits	and	eliminate	unhealthy	behaviors	then
adding	an	instant	cost	to	the	action	is	a	great	way	to	reduce	their	odds

we	repeat	bad	habits	because	they	serve	us	in	some	way	and	that
makes	them	hard	to	abandon	the	best	way	i	know	to	overcome	this
predicament	is	to	increase	the	speed	of	the	punishment	associated	with
the	behavior	there	cannot	be	a	gap	between	the	action	and	the
consequences

as	soon	as	actions	incur	an	immediate	consequence	behavior
begins	to	change	customers	pay	their	bills	on	time	when	they	are
charged	a	late	fee	students	show	up	to	class	when	their	grade	is	linked
to	attendance	well	jump	through	a	lot	of	hoops	to	avoid	a	little	bit	of
immediate	pain

there	is	of	course	a	limit	to	this	if	you are	going	to	rely	on

punishment	to	change	behavior	then	the	strength	of	the	punishment
must	match	the	relative	strength	of	the	behavior	it	is	trying	to	correct
to	be	productive	the	cost	of	procrastination	must	be	greater	than	the
cost	of	action	to	be	healthy	the	cost	of	laziness	must	be	greater	than
the	cost	of	exercise	getting	fined	for	smoking	in	a	restaurant	or	failing

to	recycle	adds	consequence	to	an	action	behavior	only	shifts	if	the
punishment	is	painful	enough	and	reliably	enforced

in	general	the	more	local	tangible	concrete	and	immediate	the
consequence	the	more	likely	it	is	to	influence	individual	behavior	the
more	global	intangible	vague	and	delayed	the	consequence	the	less
likely	it	is	to	influence	individual	behavior

thankfully	there	is	a	straightforward	way	to	add	an	immediate	cost

to	any	bad	habit	create	a	habit	contract

the	habit	contract

the	first	seat	belt	law	was	passed	in	new	york	on	december	1	1984	at
the	time	just	14	percent	of	people	in	the	united	states	regularly	wore	a
seat	beltbut	that	was	all	about	to	change

within	five	years	over	half	of	the	nation	had	seat	belt	laws	today
wearing	a	seat	belt	is	enforceable	by	law	in	fortynine	of	the	fifty	states
and	its	not	just	the	legislation	the	number	of	people	wearing	seat
belts	has	changed	dramatically	as	well	in	2016	over	88	percent	of
americans	buckled	up	each	time	they	got	in	a	car	in	just	over	thirty
years	there	was	a	complete	reversal	in	the	habits	of	millions	of	people

laws	and	regulations	are	an	example	of	how	government	can
change	our	habits	by	creating	a	social	contract	as	a	society	we
collectively	agree	to	abide	by	certain	rules	and	then	enforce	them	as	a
group	whenever	a	new	piece	of	legislation	impacts	behaviorseat	belt
laws	banning	smoking	inside	restaurants	mandatory	recyclingit	is
an	example	of	a	social	contract	shaping	our	habits	the	group	agrees	to
act	in	a	certain	way	and	if	you	do not	follow	along	you will	be	punished

just	as	governments	use	laws	to	hold	citizens	accountable	you	can
create	a	habit	contract	to	hold	yourself	accountable	a	habit	contract	is
a	verbal	or	written	agreement	in	which	you	state	your	commitment	to	a
particular	habit	and	the	punishment	that	will	occur	if	you	do not	follow
through	then	you	find	one	or	two	people	to	act	as	your	accountability
partners	and	sign	off	on	the	contract	with	you

bryan	harris	an	entrepreneur	from	nashville	tennessee	was	the
first	person	i	saw	put	this	strategy	into	action	shortly	after	the	birth	of
his	son	harris	realized	he	wanted	to	she would	a	few	pounds	he	wrote	up	a
habit	contract	between	himself	his	wife	and	his	personal	trainer	the

first	version	read	bryans	1	objective	for	q1	of	2017	is	to	start	eating
correctly	again	so	he	feels	better	looks	better	and	is	able	to	hit	his
longterm	goal	of	200	pounds	at	10	body	fat

below	that	statement	harris	laid	out	a	road	map	for	achieving	his

ideal	outcome

phase	1	get	back	to	a	strict	slowcarb	diet	in	q1

phase	2	start	a	strict	macronutrient	tracking	program	in	q2

phase	3	refine	and	maintain	the	details	of	his	diet	and	workout
program	in	q3

finally	he	wrote	out	each	of	the	daily	habits	that	would	get	him	to
his	goal	for	example	write	down	all	food	that	he	consumes	each	day
and	weigh	himself	each	day

and	then	he	listed	the	punishment	if	he	failed	if	bryan	does not	do

these	two	items	then	the	following	consequence	will	be	enforced	he
will	have	to	dress	up	each	workday	and	each	sunday	morning	for	the
rest	of	the	quarter	dress	up	is	defined	as	not	wearing	jeans	tshirts
hoodies	or	shorts	he	will	also	give	joey	his	trainer	200	to	use	as
he	sees	fit	if	he	misses	one	day	of	logging	food

at	the	bottom	of	the	page	harris	his	wife	and	his	trainer	all	signed

the	contract

my	initial	reaction	was	that	a	contract	like	this	seemed	overly

formal	and	unnecessary	especially	the	signatures	but	harris
convinced	me	that	signing	the	contract	was	an	indication	of
seriousness	anytime	i	skip	this	part	he	said	i	start	slacking	almost
immediately

three	months	later	after	hitting	his	targets	for	q1	harris	upgraded

his	goals	the	consequences	escalated	too	if	he	missed	his
carbohydrate	and	protein	targets	he	had	to	pay	his	trainer	100	and
if	he	failed	to	weigh	himself	he	had	to	give	his	wife	500	to	use	as	she
saw	fit	perhaps	most	painfully	if	he	forgot	to	run	sprints	he	had	to
dress	up	for	work	every	day	and	wear	an	alabama	hat	the	rest	of	the
quarterthe	bitter	rival	of	his	beloved	auburn	team

the	strategy	worked	with	his	wife	and	trainer	acting	as

accountability	partners	and	with	the	habit	contract	clarifying	exactly

what	to	do	each	day	harris	lost	the	weight

to	make	bad	habits	unsatisfying	your	best	option	is	to	make	them
painful	in	the	moment	creating	a	habit	contract	is	a	straightforward
way	to	do	exactly	that

even	if	you	do not	want	to	create	a	fullblown	habit	contract	simply
having	an	accountability	partner	is	useful	the	comedian	margaret	cho
writes	a	joke	or	song	every	day	she	does	the	song	a	day	challenge
with	a	friend	which	helps	them	both	stay	accountable	knowing	that
someone	is	watching	can	be	a	powerful	motivator	you	are	less	likely	to
procrastinate	or	give	up	because	there	is	an	immediate	cost	if	you
do not	follow	through	perhaps	they will	see	you	as	untrustworthy	or	lazy
suddenly	you	are	not	only	failing	to	uphold	your	promises	to	yourself
but	also	failing	to	uphold	your	promises	to	others

you	can	even	automate	this	process	thomas	frank	an

we	are	always	trying	to	present	our	best	selves	to	the	world	we

comb	our	hair	and	brush	our	teeth	and	dress	ourselves	carefully

potential	employers	and	mates	and	our	friends	and	family	we	care

the	truth	about	talent	when	genes
matter	and	when	they	do not

m

any	people	are	familiar	with	michael	phelps	who	is	widely
considered	to	be	one	of	the	greatest	athletes	in	history	phelps	has

won	more	olympic	medals	not	only	than	any	swimmer	but	also	more
than	any	olympian	in	any	sport

fewer	people	know	the	name	hicham	el	guerrouj	but	he	was	a
fantastic	athlete	in	his	own	right	el	guerrouj	is	a	moroccan	runner
who	holds	two	olympic	gold	medals	and	is	one	of	the	greatest	middle
distance	runners	of	all	time	for	many	years	he	held	the	world	record
in	the	mile	1500meter	and	2000meter	races	at	the	olympic
games	in	athens	greece	in	2004	he	won	gold	in	the	1500meter	and
5000meter	races

these	two	athletes	are	wildly	different	in	many	ways	for	starters
one	competed	on	land	and	the	other	in	water	but	most	notably	they
differ	significantly	in	height	el	guerrouj	is	five	feet	nine	inches	tall
phelps	is	six	feet	four	inches	tall	despite	this	seveninch	difference	in
height	the	two	men	are	identical	in	one	respect	michael	phelps	and
hicham	el	guerrouj	wear	the	same	length	inseam	on	their	pants

how	is	this	possible	phelps	has	relatively	short	legs	for	his	height
and	a	very	long	torso	the	perfect	build	for	swimming	el	guerrouj	has
incredibly	long	legs	and	a	short	upper	body	an	ideal	frame	for	distance
running

now	imagine	if	these	worldclass	athletes	were	to	switch	sports
given	his	remarkable	athleticism	could	michael	phelps	become	an
olympiccaliber	distance	runner	with	enough	training	its	unlikely	at

peak	fitness	phelps	weighed	194	pounds	which	is	40	percent	heavier
than	el	guerrouj	who	competed	at	an	ultralight	138	pounds	taller
runners	are	heavier	runners	and	every	extra	pound	is	a	curse	when	it
comes	to	distance	running	against	elite	competition	phelps	would	be
doomed	from	the	start

similarly	el	guerrouj	might	be	one	of	the	best	runners	in	history
but	its	doubtful	he	would	ever	qualify	for	the	olympics	as	a	swimmer
since	1976	the	average	height	of	olympic	gold	medalists	in	the	mens
1500meter	run	is	five	feet	ten	inches	in	comparison	the	average
height	of	olympic	gold	medalists	in	the	mens	100meter	freestyle
swim	is	six	feet	four	inches	swimmers	tend	to	be	tall	and	have	long
backs	and	arms	which	are	ideal	for	pulling	through	the	water	el
guerrouj	would	be	at	a	severe	disadvantage	before	he	ever	touched	the
pool

the	secret	to	maximizing	your	odds	of	success	is	to	choose	the	right
field	of	competition	this	is	just	as	true	with	habit	change	as	it	is	with
sports	and	business	habits	are	easier	to	perform	and	more	satisfying
to	stick	with	when	they	align	with	your	natural	inclinations	and
abilities	like	michael	phelps	in	the	pool	or	hicham	el	guerrouj	on	the
track	you	want	to	play	a	game	where	the	odds	are	in	your	favor

embracing	this	strategy	requires	the	acceptance	of	the	simple	truth
that	people	are	born	with	different	abilities	some	people	do not	like	to
discuss	this	fact	on	the	surface	your	genes	seem	to	be	fixed	and	its
no	fun	to	talk	about	things	you	cannot	control	plus	phrases	like
biological	determinism	makes	it	sound	like	certain	individuals	are
destined	for	success	and	others	doomed	to	failure	but	this	is	a
shortsighted	view	of	the	influence	of	genes	on	behavior

the	strength	of	genetics	is	also	their	weakness	genes	cannot	be
easily	changed	which	means	they	provide	a	powerful	advantage	in
favorable	circumstances	and	a	serious	disadvantage	in	unfavorable
circumstances	if	you	want	to	dunk	a	basketball	being	seven	feet	tall	is
very	useful	if	you	want	to	perform	a	gymnastics	routine	being	seven
feet	tall	is	a	great	hindrance	our	environment	determines	the
suitability	of	our	genes	and	the	utility	of	our	natural	talents	when	our
environment	changes	so	do	the	qualities	that	determine	success

this	is	true	not	just	for	physical	characteristics	but	for	mental	ones
as	well	i am	smart	if	you	ask	me	about	habits	and	human	behavior	not

so	much	when	it	comes	to	knitting	rocket	propulsion	or	guitar	chords
competence	is	highly	dependent	on	context

the	people	at	the	top	of	any	competitive	field	are	not	only	well
trained	they	are	also	well	suited	to	the	task	and	this	is	why	if	you
want	to	be	truly	great	selecting	the	right	place	to	focus	is	crucial

in	short	genes	do	not	determine	your	destiny	they	determine	your

areas	of	opportunity	as	physician	gabor	mate	notes	genes	can
predispose	but	they	do not	predetermine	the	areas	where	you	are
genetically	predisposed	to	success	are	the	areas	where	habits	are	more
likely	to	be	satisfying	the	key	is	to	direct	your	effort	toward	areas	that
both	excite	you	and	match	your	natural	skills	to	align	your	ambition
with	your	ability

the	obvious	question	is	how	do	i	figure	out	where	the	odds	are	in
my	favor	how	do	i	identify	the	opportunities	and	habits	that	are	right
for	me	the	first	place	we	will	look	for	an	answer	is	by	understanding
your	personality

how	your	personality	influences	your	habits

your	genes	are	operating	beneath	the	surface	of	every	habit	indeed
beneath	the	surface	of	every	behavior	genes	have	been	shown	to
influence	everything	from	the	number	of	hours	you	spend	watching
television	to	your	likelihood	to	marry	or	divorce	to	your	tendency	to	get
addicted	to	drugs	alcohol	or	nicotine	there is	a	strong	genetic
component	to	how	obedient	or	rebellious	you	are	when	facing
authority	how	vulnerable	or	resistant	you	are	to	stressful	events	how
proactive	or	reactive	you	tend	to	be	and	even	how	captivated	or	bored
you	feel	during	sensory	experiences	like	attending	a	concert	as	robert
plomin	a	behavioral	geneticist	at	kings	college	in	london	told	me
it	is	now	at	the	point	where	we	have	stopped	testing	to	see	if	traits
have	a	genetic	component	because	we	literally	cannot	find	a	single	one
that	is not	influenced	by	our	genes

bundled	together	your	unique	cluster	of	genetic	traits	predispose

you	to	a	particular	personality	your	personality	is	the	set	of
characteristics	that	is	consistent	from	situation	to	situation	the	most
proven	scientific	analysis	of	personality	traits	is	known	as	the	big
five	which	breaks	them	down	into	five	spectrums	of	behavior

1	 openness	to	experience	from	curious	and	inventive	on	one	end

to	cautious	and	consistent	on	the	other

2	 conscientiousness	organized	and	efficient	to	easygoing	and

spontaneous

3	 extroversion	outgoing	and	energetic	to	solitary	and	reserved

you	likely	know	them	as	extroverts	vs	introverts

4	 agreeableness	friendly	and	compassionate	to	challenging	and

detached

5	 neuroticism	anxious	and	sensitive	to	confident	calm	and

stable

all	five	characteristics	have	biological	underpinnings	extroversion
for	instance	can	be	tracked	from	birth	if	scientists	play	a	loud	noise	in
the	nursing	ward	some	babies	turn	toward	it	while	others	turn	away
when	the	researchers	tracked	these	children	through	life	they	found
that	the	babies	who	turned	toward	the	noise	were	more	likely	to	grow
up	to	be	extroverts	those	who	turned	away	were	more	likely	to
become	introverts

people	who	are	high	in	agreeableness	are	kind	considerate	and

warm	they	also	tend	to	have	higher	natural	oxytocin	levels	a
hormone	that	plays	an	important	role	in	social	bonding	increases
feelings	of	trust	and	can	act	as	a	natural	antidepressant	you	can	easily
imagine	how	someone	with	more	oxytocin	might	be	inclined	to	build
habits	like	writing	thankyou	notes	or	organizing	social	events

as	a	third	example	consider	neuroticism	which	is	a	personality

trait	all	people	possess	to	various	degrees	people	who	are	high	in
neuroticism	tend	to	be	anxious	and	worry	more	than	others	this	trait
has	been	linked	to	hypersensitivity	of	the	amygdala	the	portion	of	the
brain	responsible	for	noticing	threats	in	other	words	people	who	are
more	sensitive	to	negative	cues	in	their	environment	are	more	likely	to
score	high	in	neuroticism

our	habits	are	not	solely	determined	by	our	personalities	but	there
is	no	doubt	that	our	genes	nudge	us	in	a	certain	direction	our	deeply
rooted	preferences	make	certain	behaviors	easier	for	some	people	than
for	others	you	do not	have	to	apologize	for	these	differences	or	feel
guilty	about	them	but	you	do	have	to	work	with	them	a	person	who
scores	lower	on	conscientiousness	for	example	will	be	less	likely	to	be

orderly	by	nature	and	may	need	to	rely	more	heavily	on	environment
design	to	stick	with	good	habits	as	a	reminder	for	the	less
conscientious	readers	among	us	environment	design	is	a	strategy	we
discussed	in	chapters	6	and	12

the	takeaway	is	that	you	should	build	habits	that	work	for	your
personality	people	can	get	ripped	working	out	like	a	bodybuilder	but
if	you	prefer	rock	climbing	or	cycling	or	rowing	then	shape	your
exercise	habit	around	your	interests	if	your	friend	follows	a	lowcarb
diet	but	you	find	that	lowfat	works	for	you	then	more	power	to	you	if
you	want	to	read	more	do not	be	embarrassed	if	you	prefer	steamy
romance	novels	over	nonfiction	read	whatever	fascinates	you	you
do not	have	to	build	the	habits	everyone	tells	you	to	build	choose	the
habit	that	best	suits	you	not	the	one	that	is	most	popular

there	is	a	version	of	every	habit	that	can	bring	you	joy	and

satisfaction	find	it	habits	need	to	be	enjoyable	if	they	are	going	to
stick	this	is	the	core	idea	behind	the	4th	law

tailoring	your	habits	to	your	personality	is	a	good	start	but	this	is

not	the	end	of	the	story	let us	turn	our	attention	to	finding	and
designing	situations	where	you are	at	a	natural	advantage

how	to	find	a	game	where	the	odds	are	in	your	favor

learning	to	play	a	game	where	the	odds	are	in	your	favor	is	critical	for
maintaining	motivation	and	feeling	successful	in	theory	you	can
enjoy	almost	anything	in	practice	you	are	more	likely	to	enjoy	the
things	that	come	easily	to	you	people	who	are	talented	in	a	particular
area	tend	to	be	more	competent	at	that	task	and	are	then	praised	for
doing	a	good	job	they	stay	energized	because	they	are	making
progress	where	others	have	failed	and	because	they	get	rewarded	with
better	pay	and	bigger	opportunities	which	not	only	makes	them
happier	but	also	propels	them	to	produce	even	higherquality	work	its
a	virtuous	cycle

pick	the	right	habit	and	progress	is	easy	pick	the	wrong	habit	and

life	is	a	struggle

how	do	you	pick	the	right	habit	the	first	step	is	something	we
covered	in	the	3rd	law	make	it	easy	in	many	cases	when	people	pick
the	wrong	habit	it	simply	means	they	picked	a	habit	that	was	too

difficult	when	a	habit	is	easy	you	are	more	likely	to	be	successful
when	you	are	successful	you	are	more	likely	to	feel	satisfied	however
there	is	another	level	to	consider	in	the	longrun	if	you	continue	to
advance	and	improve	any	area	can	become	challenging	at	some
point	you	need	to	make	sure	you are	playing	the	right	game	for	your
skillset	how	do	you	figure	that	out

the	most	common	approach	is	trial	and	error	of	course	there is	a

problem	with	this	strategy	life	is	short	you	do not	have	time	to	try
every	career	date	every	eligible	bachelor	or	play	every	musical
instrument	thankfully	there	is	an	effective	way	to	manage	this
conundrum	and	it	is	known	as	the	exploreexploit	tradeoff

in	the	beginning	of	a	new	activity	there	should	be	a	period	of

exploration	in	relationships	its	called	dating	in	college	its	called	the
liberal	arts	in	business	its	called	split	testing	the	goal	is	to	try	out
many	possibilities	research	a	broad	range	of	ideas	and	cast	a	wide	net

after	this	initial	period	of	exploration	shift	your	focus	to	the	best

solution	you have	foundbut	keep	experimenting	occasionally	the
proper	balance	depends	on	whether	you are	winning	or	losing	if	you
are	currently	winning	you	exploit	exploit	exploit	if	you	are	currently
losing	you	continue	to	explore	explore	explore

in	the	longrun	it	is	probably	most	effective	to	work	on	the	strategy

that	seems	to	deliver	the	best	results	about	80	to	90	percent	of	the
time	and	keep	exploring	with	the	remaining	10	to	20	percent	google
famously	asks	employees	to	spend	80	percent	of	the	workweek	on	their
official	job	and	20	percent	on	projects	of	their	choice	which	has	led	to
the	creation	of	blockbuster	products	like	adwords	and	gmail

the	optimal	approach	also	depends	on	how	much	time	you	have	if
you	have	a	lot	of	timelike	someone	at	the	beginning	of	their	career
it	makes	more	sense	to	explore	because	once	you	find	the	right	thing
you	still	have	a	good	amount	of	time	to	exploit	it	if	you are	pressed	for
timesay	as	you	come	up	on	the	deadline	for	a	projectyou	should
implement	the	best	solution	you have	found	so	far	and	get	some	results

as	you	explore	different	options	there	are	a	series	of	questions	you
can	ask	yourself	to	continually	narrow	in	on	the	habits	and	areas	that
will	be	most	satisfying	to	you

what	feels	like	fun	to	me	but	work	to	others	the	mark	of
whether	you	are	made	for	a	task	is	not	whether	you	love	it	but

whether	you	can	handle	the	pain	of	the	task	easier	than	most
people	when	are	you	enjoying	yourself	while	other	people	are
complaining	the	work	that	hurts	you	less	than	it	hurts	others	is
the	work	you	were	made	to	do

what	makes	me	lose	track	of	time	flow	is	the	mental	state
you	enter	when	you	are	so	focused	on	the	task	at	hand	that	the
rest	of	the	world	fades	away	this	blend	of	happiness	and	peak
performance	is	what	athletes	and	performers	experience	when
they	are	in	the	zone	it	is	nearly	impossible	to	experience	a	flow
state	and	not	find	the	task	satisfying	at	least	to	some	degree

where	do	i	get	greater	returns	than	the	average	person
we	are	continually	comparing	ourselves	to	those	around	us	and	a
behavior	is	more	likely	to	be	satisfying	when	the	comparison	is	in
our	favor	when	i	started	writing	at	jamesclearcom	my	email	list
grew	very	quickly	i	was not	quite	sure	what	i	was	doing	well	but	i
knew	that	results	seemed	to	be	coming	faster	for	me	than	for
some	of	my	colleagues	which	motivated	me	to	keep	writing

what	comes	naturally	to	me	for	just	a	moment	ignore	what
you	have	been	taught	ignore	what	society	has	told	you	ignore
what	others	expect	of	you	look	inside	yourself	and	ask	what
feels	natural	to	me	when	have	i	felt	alive	when	have	i	felt	like
the	real	me	no	internal	judgments	or	peoplepleasing	no
secondguessing	or	selfcriticism	just	feelings	of	engagement	and
enjoyment	whenever	you	feel	authentic	and	genuine	you	are
headed	in	the	right	direction

to	be	honest	some	of	this	process	is	just	luck	michael	phelps	and
hicham	el	guerrouj	were	lucky	to	be	born	with	a	rare	set	of	abilities
that	are	highly	valued	by	society	and	to	be	placed	in	the	ideal
environment	for	those	abilities	we	all	have	limited	time	on	this	planet
and	the	truly	great	among	us	are	the	ones	who	not	only	work	hard	but
also	have	the	good	fortune	to	be	exposed	to	opportunities	that	favor	us

but	what	if	you	do not	want	to	leave	it	up	to	luck

if	you	cannot	find	a	game	where	the	odds	are	stacked	in	your	favor

create	one	scott	adams	the	cartoonist	behind	dilbert	says
everyone	has	at	least	a	few	areas	in	which	they	could	be	in	the	top
25	with	some	effort	in	my	case	i	can	draw	better	than	most	people
but	i am	hardly	an	artist	and	i am	not	any	funnier	than	the	average

standup	comedian	who	never	makes	it	big	but	i am	funnier	than	most
people	the	magic	is	that	few	people	can	draw	well	and	write	jokes	its
the	combination	of	the	two	that	makes	what	i	do	so	rare	and	when
you	add	in	my	business	background	suddenly	i	had	a	topic	that	few
cartoonists	could	hope	to	understand	without	living	it

when	you	cannot	win	by	being	better	you	can	win	by	being	different

by	combining	your	skills	you	reduce	the	level	of	competition	which
makes	it	easier	to	stand	out	you	can	shortcut	the	need	for	a	genetic
advantage	or	for	years	of	practice	by	rewriting	the	rules	a	good
player	works	hard	to	win	the	game	everyone	else	is	playing	a	great
player	creates	a	new	game	that	favors	their	strengths	and	avoids	their
weaknesses

in	college	i	designed	my	own	major	biomechanics	which	was	a

combination	of	physics	chemistry	biology	and	anatomy	i	was not
smart	enough	to	stand	out	among	the	top	physics	or	biology	majors	so
i	created	my	own	game	and	because	it	suited	mei	was	only	taking
the	courses	i	was	interested	instudying	felt	like	less	of	a	chore	it	was
also	easier	to	avoid	the	trap	of	comparing	myself	to	everyone	else	after
all	nobody	else	was	taking	the	same	combination	of	classes	so	who
could	say	if	they	were	better	or	worse

specialization	is	a	powerful	way	to	overcome	the	accident	of	bad
genetics	the	more	you	master	a	specific	skill	the	harder	it	becomes
for	others	to	compete	with	you	many	bodybuilders	are	stronger	than
the	average	arm	wrestler	but	even	a	massive	bodybuilder	may	lose	at
arm	wrestling	because	the	arm	wrestling	champ	has	very	specific
strength	even	if	you are	not	the	most	naturally	gifted	you	can	often	win
by	being	the	best	in	a	very	narrow	category

boiling	water	will	soften	a	potato	but	harden	an	egg	you	cannot
control	whether	you are	a	potato	or	an	egg	but	you	can	decide	to	play	a
game	where	its	better	to	be	hard	or	soft	if	you	can	find	a	more
favorable	environment	you	can	transform	the	situation	from	one
where	the	odds	are	against	you	to	one	where	they	are	in	your	favor

how	to	get	the	most	out	of	your	genes

our	genes	do	not	eliminate	the	need	for	hard	work	they	clarify	it
they	tell	us	what	to	work	hard	on	once	we	realize	our	strengths	we
know	where	to	spend	our	time	and	energy	we	know	which	types	of

opportunities	to	look	for	and	which	types	of	challenges	to	avoid	the
better	we	understand	our	nature	the	better	our	strategy	can	be

biological	differences	matter	even	so	its	more	productive	to	focus

on	whether	you	are	fulfilling	your	own	potential	than	comparing
yourself	to	someone	else	the	fact	that	you	have	a	natural	limit	to	any
specific	ability	has	nothing	to	do	with	whether	you	are	reaching	the
ceiling	of	your	capabilities	people	get	so	caught	up	in	the	fact	that	they
have	limits	that	they	rarely	exert	the	effort	required	to	get	close	to
them

furthermore	genes	cannot	make	you	successful	if	you are	not	doing
the	work	yes	its	possible	that	the	ripped	trainer	at	the	gym	has	better
genes	but	if	you	have not	put	in	the	same	reps	its	impossible	to	say	if
you	have	been	dealt	a	better	or	worse	genetic	hand	until	you	work	as
hard	as	those	you	admire	do not	explain	away	their	success	as	luck

in	summary	one	of	the	best	ways	to	ensure	your	habits	remain
satisfying	over	the	longrun	is	to	pick	behaviors	that	align	with	your
personality	and	skills	work	hard	on	the	things	that	come	easy

chapter	summary

the	secret	to	maximizing	your	odds	of	success	is	to	choose	the
right	field	of	competition

pick	the	right	habit	and	progress	is	easy	pick	the	wrong	habit	and
life	is	a	struggle

genes	cannot	be	easily	changed	which	means	they	provide	a

the	goldilocks	rule	how	to	stay
motivated	in	life	and	work

i

n	1955	disneyland	had	just	opened	in	anaheim	california	when	a
tenyearold	boy	walked	in	and	asked	for	a	job	labor	laws	were

loose	back	then	and	the	boy	managed	to	land	a	position	selling
guidebooks	for	050	apiece

within	a	year	he	had	transitioned	to	disneys	magic	shop	where	he

learned	tricks	from	the	older	employees	he	experimented	with	jokes
and	tried	out	simple	routines	on	visitors	soon	he	discovered	that	what
he	loved	was	not	performing	magic	but	performing	in	general	he	set
his	sights	on	becoming	a	comedian

beginning	in	his	teenage	years	he	started	performing	in	little	clubs
around	los	angeles	the	crowds	were	small	and	his	act	was	short	he
was	rarely	on	stage	for	more	than	five	minutes	most	of	the	people	in
the	crowd	were	too	busy	drinking	or	talking	with	friends	to	pay
attention	one	night	he	literally	delivered	his	standup	routine	to	an
empty	club

it	was not	glamorous	work	but	there	was	no	doubt	he	was	getting
better	his	first	routines	would	only	last	one	or	two	minutes	by	high
school	his	material	had	expanded	to	include	a	fiveminute	act	and	a
few	years	later	a	tenminute	show	at	nineteen	he	was	performing
weekly	for	twenty	minutes	at	a	time	he	had	to	read	three	poems
during	the	show	just	to	make	the	routine	long	enough	but	his	skills
continued	to	progress

he	spent	another	decade	experimenting	adjusting	and	practicing
he	took	a	job	as	a	television	writer	and	gradually	he	was	able	to	land

his	own	appearances	on	talk	shows	by	the	mid1970s	he	had	worked
his	way	into	being	a	regular	guest	on	the	tonight	show	and	saturday
night	live

finally	after	nearly	fifteen	years	of	work	the	young	man	rose	to
fame	he	toured	sixty	cities	in	sixtythree	days	then	seventytwo	cities
in	eighty	days	then	eightyfive	cities	in	ninety	days	he	had	18695
people	attend	one	show	in	ohio	another	45000	tickets	were	sold	for
his	threeday	show	in	new	york	he	catapulted	to	the	top	of	his	genre
and	became	one	of	the	most	successful	comedians	of	his	time

his	name	is	steve	martin

martins	story	offers	a	fascinating	perspective	on	what	it	takes	to
stick	with	habits	for	the	long	run	comedy	is	not	for	the	timid	it	is
hard	to	imagine	a	situation	that	would	strike	fear	into	the	hearts	of
more	people	than	performing	alone	on	stage	and	failing	to	get	a	single
laugh	and	yet	steve	martin	faced	this	fear	every	week	for	eighteen
years	in	his	words	10	years	spent	learning	4	years	spent	refining
and	4	years	as	a	wild	success

why	is	it	that	some	people	like	martin	stick	with	their	habits
whether	practicing	jokes	or	drawing	cartoons	or	playing	guitarwhile
most	of	us	struggle	to	stay	motivated	how	do	we	design	habits	that
pull	us	in	rather	than	ones	that	fade	away	scientists	have	been
studying	this	question	for	many	years	while	there	is	still	much	to
learn	one	of	the	most	consistent	findings	is	that	the	way	to	maintain
motivation	and	achieve	peak	levels	of	desire	is	to	work	on	tasks	of	just
manageable	difficulty

the	human	brain	loves	a	challenge	but	only	if	it	is	within	an
optimal	zone	of	difficulty	if	you	love	tennis	and	try	to	play	a	serious
match	against	a	fouryearold	you	will	quickly	become	bored	its	too
easy	you will	win	every	point	in	contrast	if	you	play	a	professional
tennis	player	like	roger	federer	or	serena	williams	you	will	quickly
lose	motivation	because	the	match	is	too	difficult

now	consider	playing	tennis	against	someone	who	is	your	equal	as
the	game	progresses	you	win	a	few	points	and	you	lose	a	few	you	have
a	good	chance	of	winning	but	only	if	you	really	try	your	focus
narrows	distractions	fade	away	and	you	find	yourself	fully	invested	in
the	task	at	hand	this	is	a	challenge	of	just	manageable	difficulty	and	it
is	a	prime	example	of	the	goldilocks	rule

the	goldilocks	rule	states	that	humans	experience	peak	motivation

when	working	on	tasks	that	are	right	on	the	edge	of	their	current
abilities	not	too	hard	not	too	easy	just	right

the	goldilocks	rule

figure	15	maximum	motivation	occurs	when	facing	a	challenge	of	just
manageable	difficulty	in	psychology	research	this	is	known	as	the	yerkes
dodson	law	which	describes	the	optimal	level	of	arousal	as	the	midpoint
between	boredom	and	anxiety

martins	comedy	career	is	an	excellent	example	of	the	goldilocks
rule	in	practice	each	year	he	expanded	his	comedy	routinebut	only
by	a	minute	or	two	he	was	always	adding	new	material	but	he	also
kept	a	few	jokes	that	were	guaranteed	to	get	laughs	there	were	just
enough	victories	to	keep	him	motivated	and	just	enough	mistakes	to
keep	him	working	hard

when	you are	starting	a	new	habit	its	important	to	keep	the
behavior	as	easy	as	possible	so	you	can	stick	with	it	even	when
conditions	are not	perfect	this	is	an	idea	we	covered	in	detail	while
discussing	the	3rd	law	of	behavior	change

once	a	habit	has	been	established	however	its	important	to

continue	to	advance	in	small	ways	these	little	improvements	and	new
challenges	keep	you	engaged	and	if	you	hit	the	goldilocks	zone	just
right	you	can	achieve	a	flow	state

a	flow	state	is	the	experience	of	being	in	the	zone	and	fully

immersed	in	an	activity	scientists	have	tried	to	quantify	this	feeling
they	found	that	to	achieve	a	state	of	flow	a	task	must	be	roughly	4
percent	beyond	your	current	ability	in	real	life	its	typically	not
feasible	to	quantify	the	difficulty	of	an	action	in	this	way	but	the	core
idea	of	the	goldilocks	rule	remains	working	on	challenges	of	just
manageable	difficultysomething	on	the	perimeter	of	your	ability
seems	crucial	for	maintaining	motivation

improvement	requires	a	delicate	balance	you	need	to	regularly
search	for	challenges	that	push	you	to	your	edge	while	continuing	to
make	enough	progress	to	stay	motivated	behaviors	need	to	remain
novel	in	order	for	them	to	stay	attractive	and	satisfying	without
variety	we	get	bored	and	boredom	is	perhaps	the	greatest	villain	on
the	quest	for	selfimprovement

how	to	stay	focused	when	you	get	bored	working	on
your	goals

after	my	baseball	career	ended	i	was	looking	for	a	new	sport	i	joined
a	weightlifting	team	and	one	day	an	elite	coach	visited	our	gym	he	had
worked	with	thousands	of	athletes	during	his	long	career	including	a
few	olympians	i	introduced	myself	and	we	began	talking	about	the
process	of	improvement

what is	the	difference	between	the	best	athletes	and	everyone	else

i	asked	what	do	the	really	successful	people	do	that	most	do not

he	mentioned	the	factors	you	might	expect	genetics	luck	talent
but	then	he	said	something	i	was not	expecting	at	some	point	it	comes
down	to	who	can	handle	the	boredom	of	training	every	day	doing	the
same	lifts	over	and	over	and	over

his	answer	surprised	me	because	its	a	different	way	of	thinking
about	work	ethic	people	talk	about	getting	amped	up	to	work	on
their	goals	whether	its	business	or	sports	or	art	you	hear	people	say
things	like	it	all	comes	down	to	passion	or	you	have	to	really	want

it	as	a	result	many	of	us	get	depressed	when	we	lose	focus	or
motivation	because	we	think	that	successful	people	have	some
bottomless	reserve	of	passion	but	this	coach	was	saying	that	really
successful	people	feel	the	same	lack	of	motivation	as	everyone	else	the
difference	is	that	they	still	find	a	way	to	show	up	despite	the	feelings	of
boredom

mastery	requires	practice	but	the	more	you	practice	something	the

more	boring	and	routine	it	becomes	once	the	beginner	gains	have
been	made	and	we	learn	what	to	expect	our	interest	starts	to	fade
sometimes	it	happens	even	faster	than	that	all	you	have	to	do	is	hit
the	gym	a	few	days	in	a	row	or	publish	a	couple	of	blog	posts	on	time
and	letting	one	day	slip	does not	feel	like	much	things	are	going	well
its	easy	to	rationalize	taking	a	day	off	because	you are	in	a	good	place

the	greatest	threat	to	success	is	not	failure	but	boredom	we	get

bored	with	habits	because	they	stop	delighting	us	the	outcome
becomes	expected	and	as	our	habits	become	ordinary	we	start
derailing	our	progress	to	seek	novelty	perhaps	this	is	why	we	get
caught	up	in	a	neverending	cycle	jumping	from	one	workout	to	the
next	one	diet	to	the	next	one	business	idea	to	the	next	as	soon	as	we
experience	the	slightest	dip	in	motivation	we	begin	seeking	a	new
strategyeven	if	the	old	one	was	still	working	as	machiavelli	noted
men	desire	novelty	to	such	an	extent	that	those	who	are	doing	well
wish	for	a	change	as	much	as	those	who	are	doing	badly

perhaps	this	is	why	many	of	the	most	habitforming	products	are
those	that	provide	continuous	forms	of	novelty	video	games	provide
visual	novelty	porn	provides	sexual	novelty	junk	foods	provide
culinary	novelty	each	of	these	experiences	offer	continual	elements	of
surprise

in	psychology	this	is	known	as	a	variable	reward	slot	machines
are	the	most	common	realworld	example	a	gambler	hits	the	jackpot
every	now	and	then	but	not	at	any	predictable	interval	the	pace	of
rewards	varies	this	variance	leads	to	the	greatest	spike	of	dopamine
enhances	memory	recall	and	accelerates	habit	formation

variable	rewards	will not	create	a	cravingthat	is	you	cannot	take	a
reward	people	are	uninterested	in	give	it	to	them	at	a	variable	interval
and	hope	it	will	change	their	mindbut	they	are	a	powerful	way	to
amplify	the	cravings	we	already	experience	because	they	reduce
boredom

the	sweet	spot	of	desire	occurs	at	a	5050	split	between	success	and

failure	half	of	the	time	you	get	what	you	want	half	of	the	time	you
do not	you	need	just	enough	winning	to	experience	satisfaction	and
just	enough	wanting	to	experience	desire	this	is	one	of	the	benefits
of	following	the	goldilocks	rule	if	you are	already	interested	in	a	habit
working	on	challenges	of	just	manageable	difficulty	is	a	good	way	to
keep	things	interesting

of	course	not	all	habits	have	a	variable	reward	component	and	you

would not	want	them	to	if	google	only	delivered	a	useful	search	result
some	of	the	time	i	would	switch	to	a	competitor	pretty	quickly	if	uber
only	picked	up	half	of	my	trips	i	doubt	id	be	using	that	service	much
longer	and	if	i	flossed	my	teeth	each	night	and	only	sometimes	ended
up	with	a	clean	mouth	i	think	id	skip	it

variable	rewards	or	not	no	habit	will	stay	interesting	forever	at
some	point	everyone	faces	the	same	challenge	on	the	journey	of	self
improvement	you	have	to	fall	in	love	with	boredom

we	all	have	goals	that	we	would	like	to	achieve	and	dreams	that	we
would	like	to	fulfill	but	it	does not	matter	what	you	are	trying	to	become
better	at	if	you	only	do	the	work	when	its	convenient	or	exciting	then
you will	never	be	consistent	enough	to	achieve	remarkable	results

i	can	guarantee	that	if	you	manage	to	start	a	habit	and	keep	sticking

to	it	there	will	be	days	when	you	feel	like	quitting	when	you	start	a
business	there	will	be	days	when	you	do not	feel	like	showing	up	when
you are	at	the	gym	there	will	be	sets	that	you	do not	feel	like	finishing
when	its	time	to	write	there	will	be	days	that	you	do not	feel	like
typing	but	stepping	up	when	its	annoying	or	painful	or	draining	to	do
so	that is	what	makes	the	difference	between	a	professional	and	an
amateur

professionals	stick	to	the	schedule	amateurs	let	life	get	in	the	way
professionals	know	what	is	important	to	them	and	work	toward	it	with
purpose	amateurs	get	pulled	off	course	by	the	urgencies	of	life

david	cain	an	author	and	meditation	teacher	encourages	his

students	to	avoid	being	fairweather	meditators	similarly	you	do not
want	to	be	a	fairweather	athlete	or	a	fairweather	writer	or	a	fair
weather	anything	when	a	habit	is	truly	important	to	you	you	have	to
be	willing	to	stick	to	it	in	any	mood	professionals	take	action	even

when	the	mood	is not	right	they	might	not	enjoy	it	but	they	find	a	way
to	put	the	reps	in

there	have	been	a	lot	of	sets	that	i	have not	felt	like	finishing	but	i have

never	regretted	doing	the	workout	there	have	been	a	lot	of	articles	i
have not	felt	like	writing	but	i have	never	regretted	publishing	on
schedule	there	have	been	a	lot	of	days	i have	felt	like	relaxing	but	i have
never	regretted	showing	up	and	working	on	something	that	was
important	to	me

the	only	way	to	become	excellent	is	to	be	endlessly	fascinated	by

doing	the	same	thing	over	and	over	you	have	to	fall	in	love	with
boredom

chapter	summary

the	goldilocks	rule	states	that	humans	experience	peak
motivation	when	working	on	tasks	that	are	right	on	the	edge	of
their	current	abilities

the	greatest	threat	to	success	is	not	failure	but	boredom

as	habits	become	routine	they	become	less	interesting	and	less
satisfying	we	get	bored

anyone	can	work	hard	when	they	feel	motivated	its	the	ability	to
keep	going	when	work	is not	exciting	that	makes	the	difference

professionals	stick	to	the	schedule	amateurs	let	life	get	in	the

the	downside	of	creating	good	habits

h

abits	create	the	foundation	for	mastery	in	chess	it	is	only	after
the	basic	movements	of	the	pieces	have	become	automatic	that	a

player	can	focus	on	the	next	level	of	the	game	each	chunk	of
information	that	is	memorized	opens	up	the	mental	space	for	more
effortful	thinking	this	is	true	for	any	endeavor	when	you	know	the
simple	movements	so	well	that	you	can	perform	them	without
thinking	you	are	free	to	pay	attention	to	more	advanced	details	in	this
way	habits	are	the	backbone	of	any	pursuit	of	excellence

however	the	benefits	of	habits	come	at	a	cost	at	first	each
repetition	develops	fluency	speed	and	skill	but	then	as	a	habit
becomes	automatic	you	become	less	sensitive	to	feedback	you	fall
into	mindless	repetition	it	becomes	easier	to	let	mistakes	slide	when
you	can	do	it	good	enough	on	autopilot	you	stop	thinking	about	how
to	do	it	better

the	upside	of	habits	is	that	we	can	do	things	without	thinking	the

downside	of	habits	is	that	you	get	used	to	doing	things	a	certain	way
and	stop	paying	attention	to	little	errors	you	assume	you are	getting
better	because	you are	gaining	experience	in	reality	you	are	merely
reinforcing	your	current	habitsnot	improving	them	in	fact	some
research	has	shown	that	once	a	skill	has	been	mastered	there	is	usually
a	slight	decline	in	performance	over	time

usually	this	minor	dip	in	performance	is	no	because	for	worry	you
do not	need	a	system	to	continuously	improve	how	well	you	brush	your
teeth	or	tie	your	shoes	or	make	your	morning	cup	of	tea	with	habits
like	these	good	enough	is	usually	good	enough	the	less	energy	you

spend	on	trivial	choices	the	more	you	can	spend	it	on	what	really
matters

however	when	you	want	to	maximize	your	potential	and	achieve
elite	levels	of	performance	you	need	a	more	nuanced	approach	you
cannot	repeat	the	same	things	blindly	and	expect	to	become	exceptional
habits	are	necessary	but	not	sufficient	for	mastery	what	you	need	is	a
combination	of	automatic	habits	and	deliberate	practice

habits		deliberate	practice		mastery

to	become	great	certain	skills	do	need	to	become	automatic
basketball	players	need	to	be	able	to	dribble	without	thinking	before
they	can	move	on	to	mastering	layups	with	their	nondominant	hand
surgeons	need	to	repeat	the	first	incision	so	many	times	that	they
could	do	it	with	their	eyes	closed	so	that	they	can	focus	on	the
hundreds	of	variables	that	arise	during	surgery	but	after	one	habit	has
been	mastered	you	have	to	return	to	the	effortful	part	of	the	work	and
begin	building	the	next	habit

mastery	is	the	process	of	narrowing	your	focus	to	a	tiny	element	of

success	repeating	it	until	you	have	internalized	the	skill	and	then
using	this	new	habit	as	the	foundation	to	advance	to	the	next	frontier
of	your	development	old	tasks	become	easier	the	second	time	around
but	it	does not	get	easier	overall	because	now	you are	pouring	your
energy	into	the	next	challenge	each	habit	unlocks	the	next	level	of
performance	its	an	endless	cycle

mastering	one	habit

mastering	a	field

figure	16	the	process	of	mastery	requires	that	you	progressively	layer
improvements	on	top	of	one	another	each	habit	building	upon	the	last	until	a
new	level	of	performance	has	been	reached	and	a	higher	range	of	skills	has
been	internalized

although	habits	are	powerful	what	you	need	is	a	way	to	remain
conscious	of	your	performance	over	time	so	you	can	continue	to	refine
and	improve	it	is	precisely	at	the	moment	when	you	begin	to	feel	like
you	have	mastered	a	skillright	when	things	are	starting	to	feel

automatic	and	you	are	becoming	comfortablethat	you	must	avoid
slipping	into	the	trap	of	complacency

the	solution	establish	a	system	for	reflection	and	review

how	to	review	your	habits	and	make	adjustments

in	1986	the	los	angeles	lakers	had	one	of	the	most	talented
basketball	teams	ever	assembled	but	they	are	rarely	remembered	that
way	the	team	started	the	19851986	nba	season	with	an	astounding
295	record	the	pundits	were	saying	that	we	might	be	the	best	team
in	the	history	of	basketball	head	coach	pat	riley	said	after	the	season
surprisingly	the	lakers	stumbled	in	the	1986	playoffs	and	suffered	a
seasonending	defeat	in	the	western	conference	finals	the	best
team	in	the	history	of	basketball	did not	even	play	for	the	nba
championship

after	that	blow	riley	was	tired	of	hearing	about	how	much	talent
his	players	had	and	about	how	much	promise	his	team	held	he	did not
want	to	see	flashes	of	brilliance	followed	by	a	gradual	fade	in
performance	he	wanted	the	lakers	to	play	up	to	their	potential	night
after	night	in	the	summer	of	1986	he	created	a	plan	to	do	exactly	that
a	system	that	he	called	the	career	best	effort	program	or	cbe

when	players	first	join	the	lakers	riley	explained	we	track	their

basketball	statistics	all	the	way	back	to	high	school	i	call	this	taking
their	number	we	look	for	an	accurate	gauge	of	what	a	player	can	do
then	build	him	into	our	plan	for	the	team	based	on	the	notion	that	he
will	maintain	and	then	improve	upon	his	averages

after	determining	a	players	baseline	level	of	performance	riley
added	a	key	step	he	asked	each	player	to	improve	their	output	by	at
least	1	percent	over	the	course	of	the	season	if	they	succeeded	it
would	be	a	cbe	or	career	best	effort	similar	to	the	british	cycling
team	that	we	discussed	in	chapter	1	the	lakers	sought	peak
performance	by	getting	slightly	better	each	day

riley	was	careful	to	point	out	that	cbe	was	not	merely	about	points
or	statistics	but	about	giving	your	best	effort	spiritually	and	mentally
and	physically	players	got	credit	for	allowing	an	opponent	to	run
into	you	when	you	know	that	a	foul	will	be	called	against	him	diving
for	loose	balls	going	after	rebounds	whether	you	are	likely	to	get	them

or	not	helping	a	teammate	when	the	player	hes	guarding	has	surged
past	him	and	other	unsung	hero	deeds

as	an	example	let us	say	that	magic	johnsonthe	lakers	star	player

at	the	timehad	11	points	8	rebounds	12	assists	2	steals	and	5
turnovers	in	a	game	magic	also	got	credit	for	an	unsung	hero	deed
by	diving	after	a	loose	ball	1	finally	he	played	a	total	of	33	minutes
in	this	imaginary	game

the	positive	numbers	11		8		12		2		1	add	up	to	34	then	we
subtract	the	5	turnovers	345	to	get	29	finally	we	divide	29	by	33
minutes	played

2933		0879

magics	cbe	number	here	would	be	879	this	number	was

calculated	for	all	of	a	players	games	and	it	was	the	average	cbe	that	a
player	was	asked	to	improve	by	1	percent	over	the	season	riley
compared	each	players	current	cbe	to	not	only	their	past
performances	but	also	those	of	other	players	in	the	league	as	riley	put
it	we	rank	team	members	alongside	league	opponents	who	play	the
same	position	and	have	similar	role	definitions

sportswriter	jackie	macmullan	noted	riley	trumpeted	the	top
performers	in	the	league	in	bold	lettering	on	the	blackboard	each	week
and	measured	them	against	the	corresponding	players	on	his	own
roster	solid	reliable	players	generally	rated	a	score	in	the	600s	while
elite	players	scored	at	least	800	magic	johnson	who	submitted	138
tripledoubles	in	his	career	often	scored	over	1000

the	lakers	also	emphasized	yearoveryear	progress	by	making
historical	comparisons	of	cbe	data	riley	said	we	stacked	the	month
of	november	1986	next	to	november	1985	and	showed	the	players
whether	they	were	doing	better	or	worse	than	at	the	same	point	last
season	then	we	showed	them	how	their	performance	figures	for
december	1986	stacked	up	against	novembers

the	lakers	rolled	out	cbe	in	october	1986	eight	months	later	they

were	nba	champions	the	following	year	pat	riley	led	his	team	to
another	title	as	the	lakers	became	the	first	team	in	twenty	years	to	win
backtoback	nba	championships	afterward	he	said	sustaining	an
effort	is	the	most	important	thing	for	any	enterprise	the	way	to	be
successful	is	to	learn	how	to	do	things	right	then	do	them	the	same
way	every	time

the	cbe	program	is	a	prime	example	of	the	power	of	reflection	and

review	the	lakers	were	already	talented	cbe	helped	them	get	the
most	out	of	what	they	had	and	made	sure	their	habits	improved	rather
than	declined

reflection	and	review	enables	the	longterm	improvement	of	all
habits	because	it	makes	you	aware	of	your	mistakes	and	helps	you
consider	possible	paths	for	improvement	without	reflection	we	can
make	excuses	create	rationalizations	and	lie	to	ourselves	we	have	no
process	for	determining	whether	we	are	performing	better	or	worse
compared	to	yesterday

top	performers	in	all	fields	engage	in	various	types	of	reflection	and

review	and	the	process	does not	have	to	be	complex	kenyan	runner
eliud	kipchoge	is	one	of	the	greatest	marathoners	of	all	time	and	an
olympic	gold	medalist	he	still	takes	notes	after	every	practice	in
which	he	reviews	his	training	for	the	day	and	searches	for	areas	that
can	be	improved	similarly	gold	medal	swimmer	katie	ledecky
records	her	wellness	on	a	scale	of	1	to	10	and	includes	notes	on	her
nutrition	and	how	well	she	slept	she	also	records	the	times	posted	by
other	swimmers	at	the	end	of	each	week	her	coach	goes	over	her
notes	and	adds	his	thoughts

its	not	just	athletes	either	when	comedian	chris	rock	is	preparing

fresh	material	he	will	first	appear	at	small	nightclubs	dozens	of	times
and	test	hundreds	of	jokes	he	brings	a	notepad	on	stage	and	records
which	bits	go	over	well	and	where	he	needs	to	make	adjustments	the
few	killer	lines	that	survive	will	form	the	backbone	of	his	new	show

i	know	of	executives	and	investors	who	keep	a	decision	journal	in
which	they	record	the	major	decisions	they	make	each	week	why	they
made	them	and	what	they	expect	the	outcome	to	be	they	review	their
choices	at	the	end	of	each	month	or	year	to	see	where	they	were	correct
and	where	they	went	wrong

improvement	is	not	just	about	learning	habits	its	also	about	fine
tuning	them	reflection	and	review	ensures	that	you	spend	your	time
on	the	right	things	and	make	course	corrections	whenever	necessary
like	pat	riley	adjusting	the	effort	of	his	players	on	a	nightly	basis	you
do not	want	to	keep	practicing	a	habit	if	it	becomes	ineffective

personally	i	employ	two	primary	modes	of	reflection	and	review
each	december	i	perform	an	annual	review	in	which	i	reflect	on	the

previous	year	i	tally	my	habits	for	the	year	by	counting	up	how	many
articles	i	published	how	many	workouts	i	put	in	how	many	new
places	i	visited	and	more	then	i	reflect	on	my	progress	or	lack
thereof	by	answering	three	questions

1	 what	went	well	this	year

2	 what	did not	go	so	well	this	year

3	 what	did	i	learn

six	months	later	when	summer	rolls	around	i	conduct	an	integrity

report	like	everyone	i	make	a	lot	of	mistakes	my	integrity	report
helps	me	realize	where	i	went	wrong	and	motivates	me	to	get	back	on
course	i	use	it	as	a	time	to	revisit	my	core	values	and	consider	whether
i	have	been	living	in	accordance	with	them	this	is	when	i	reflect	on
my	identity	and	how	i	can	work	toward	being	the	type	of	person	i	wish
to	become

my	yearly	integrity	report	answers	three	questions

1	 what	are	the	core	values	that	drive	my	life	and	work

2	 how	am	i	living	and	working	with	integrity	right	now

3	 how	can	i	set	a	higher	standard	in	the	future

these	two	reports	do not	take	very	longjust	a	few	hours	per	year

but	they	are	crucial	periods	of	refinement	they	prevent	the	gradual
slide	that	happens	when	i	do not	pay	close	attention	they	provide	an
annual	reminder	to	revisit	my	desired	identity	and	consider	how	my
habits	are	helping	me	become	the	type	of	person	i	wish	to	be	they
indicate	when	i	should	upgrade	my	habits	and	take	on	new	challenges
and	when	i	should	dial	my	efforts	back	and	focus	on	the	fundamentals

reflection	can	also	bring	a	sense	of	perspective	daily	habits	are
powerful	because	of	how	they	compound	but	worrying	too	much	about
every	daily	choice	is	like	looking	at	yourself	in	the	mirror	from	an	inch
away	you	can	see	every	imperfection	and	lose	sight	of	the	bigger
picture	there	is	too	much	feedback	conversely	never	reviewing	your
habits	is	like	never	looking	in	the	mirror	you	are not	aware	of	easily
fixable	flawsa	spot	on	your	shirt	a	bit	of	food	in	your	teeth	there	is

too	little	feedback	periodic	reflection	and	review	is	like	viewing
yourself	in	the	mirror	from	a	conversational	distance	you	can	see	the
important	changes	you	should	make	without	losing	sight	of	the	bigger
picture	you	want	to	view	the	entire	mountain	range	not	obsess	over
each	peak	and	valley

finally	reflection	and	review	offers	an	ideal	time	to	revisit	one	of

the	most	important	aspects	of	behavior	change	identity

how	to	break	the	beliefs	that	hold	you	back

in	the	beginning	repeating	a	habit	is	essential	to	build	up	evidence	of
your	desired	identity	as	you	latch	on	to	that	new	identity	however
those	same	beliefs	can	hold	you	back	from	the	next	level	of	growth
when	working	against	you	your	identity	creates	a	kind	of	pride	that
encourages	you	to	deny	your	weak	spots	and	prevents	you	from	truly
growing	this	is	one	of	the	greatest	downsides	of	building	habits

the	more	sacred	an	idea	is	to	usthat	is	the	more	deeply	it	is	tied
to	our	identitythe	more	strongly	we	will	defend	it	against	criticism
you	see	this	in	every	industry	the	schoolteacher	who	ignores
innovative	teaching	methods	and	sticks	with	her	triedandtrue	lesson
plans	the	veteran	manager	who	is	committed	to	doing	things	his
way	the	surgeon	who	dismisses	the	ideas	of	her	younger	colleagues
the	band	who	produces	a	mindblowing	first	album	and	then	gets
stuck	in	a	rut	the	tighter	we	cling	to	an	identity	the	harder	it	becomes
to	grow	beyond	it

one	solution	is	to	avoid	making	any	single	aspect	of	your	identity	an

overwhelming	portion	of	who	you	are	in	the	words	of	investor	paul
graham	keep	your	identity	small	the	more	you	let	a	single	belief
define	you	the	less	capable	you	are	of	adapting	when	life	challenges
you	if	you	tie	everything	up	in	being	the	point	guard	or	the	partner	at
the	firm	or	whatever	else	then	the	loss	of	that	facet	of	your	life	will
wreck	you	if	you are	a	vegan	and	then	develop	a	health	condition	that
forces	you	to	change	your	diet	you will	have	an	identity	crisis	on	your
hands	when	you	cling	too	tightly	to	one	identity	you	become	brittle
lose	that	one	thing	and	you	lose	yourself

for	most	of	my	young	life	being	an	athlete	was	a	major	part	of	my

identity	after	my	baseball	career	ended	i	struggled	to	find	myself

when	you	spend	your	whole	life	defining	yourself	in	one	way	and	that
disappears	who	are	you	now

military	veterans	and	former	entrepreneurs	report	similar	feelings
if	your	identity	is	wrapped	up	in	a	belief	like	i am	a	great	soldier	what
happens	when	your	period	of	service	ends	for	many	business	owners
their	identity	is	something	along	the	lines	of	i am	the	ceo	or	i am	the
founder	if	you	have	spent	every	waking	moment	working	on	your
business	how	will	you	feel	after	you	sell	the	company

the	key	to	mitigating	these	losses	of	identity	is	to	redefine	yourself

such	that	you	get	to	keep	important	aspects	of	your	identity	even	if
your	particular	role	changes

i am	an	athlete	becomes	i am	the	type	of	person	who	is	mentally
tough	and	loves	a	physical	challenge

i am	a	great	soldier	transforms	into	i am	the	type	of	person	who
is	disciplined	reliable	and	great	on	a	team

i am	the	ceo	translates	to	i am	the	type	of	person	who	builds
and	creates	things

when	chosen	effectively	an	identity	can	be	flexible	rather	than

brittle	like	water	flowing	around	an	obstacle	your	identity	works	with
the	changing	circumstances	rather	than	against	them

the	following	quote	from	the	tao	te	ching	encapsulates	the	ideas

habits	deliver	numerous	benefits	but	the	downside	is	that	they	can

lock	us	into	our	previous	patterns	of	thinking	and	actingeven	when
the	world	is	shifting	around	us	everything	is	impermanent	life	is
constantly	changing	so	you	need	to	periodically	check	in	to	see	if	your
old	habits	and	beliefs	are	still	serving	you

a	lack	of	selfawareness	is	poison	reflection	and	review	is	the

antidote

chapter	summary

the	upside	of	habits	is	that	we	can	do	things	without	thinking
the	downside	is	that	we	stop	paying	attention	to	little	errors

habits		deliberate	practice		mastery

reflection	and	review	is	a	process	that	allows	you	to	remain
conscious	of	your	performance	over	time

the	tighter	we	cling	to	an	identity	the	harder	it	becomes	to	grow
beyond	it

the	secret	to	results	that	last

t

here	is	an	ancient	greek	parable	known	as	the	sorites	paradox
which	talks	about	the	effect	one	small	action	can	have	when
repeated	enough	times	one	formulation	of	the	paradox	goes	as
follows	can	one	coin	make	a	person	rich	if	you	give	a	person	a	pile	of
ten	coins	you	would not	claim	that	he	or	she	is	rich	but	what	if	you	add
another	and	another	and	another	at	some	point	you	will	have	to
admit	that	no	one	can	be	rich	unless	one	coin	can	make	him	or	her	so

we	can	say	the	same	about	atomic	habits	can	one	tiny	change
transform	your	life	its	unlikely	you	would	say	so	but	what	if	you
made	another	and	another	and	another	at	some	point	you	will
have	to	admit	that	your	life	was	transformed	by	one	small	change

the	holy	grail	of	habit	change	is	not	a	single	1	percent	improvement
but	a	thousand	of	them	its	a	bunch	of	atomic	habits	stacking	up	each
one	a	fundamental	unit	of	the	overall	system

in	the	beginning	small	improvements	can	often	seem	meaningless
because	they	get	washed	away	by	the	weight	of	the	system	just	as	one
coin	will not	make	you	rich	one	positive	change	like	meditating	for	one
minute	or	reading	one	page	each	day	is	unlikely	to	deliver	a	noticeable
difference

gradually	though	as	you	continue	to	layer	small	changes	on	top	of
one	another	the	scales	of	life	start	to	move	each	improvement	is	like
adding	a	grain	of	sand	to	the	positive	side	of	the	scale	slowly	tilting
things	in	your	favor	eventually	if	you	stick	with	it	you	hit	a	tipping
point	suddenly	it	feels	easier	to	stick	with	good	habits	the	weight	of
the	system	is	working	for	you	rather	than	against	you

over	the	course	of	this	book	we have	looked	at	dozens	of	stories	about

top	performers	we have	heard	about	olympic	gold	medalists	award
winning	artists	business	leaders	lifesaving	physicians	and	star
comedians	who	have	all	used	the	science	of	small	habits	to	master	their

craft	and	vault	to	the	top	of	their	field	each	of	the	people	teams	and
companies	we	have	covered	has	faced	different	circumstances	but
ultimately	progressed	in	the	same	way	through	a	commitment	to	tiny
sustainable	unrelenting	improvements

success	is	not	a	goal	to	reach	or	a	finish	line	to	cross	it	is	a	system
to	improve	an	endless	process	to	refine	in	chapter	1	i	said	if	you are
having	trouble	changing	your	habits	the	problem	is not	you	the
problem	is	your	system	bad	habits	repeat	themselves	again	and	again
not	because	you	do not	want	to	change	but	because	you	have	the	wrong
system	for	change

as	this	book	draws	to	a	close	i	hope	the	opposite	is	true	with	the
four	laws	of	behavior	change	you	have	a	set	of	tools	and	strategies
that	you	can	use	to	build	better	systems	and	shape	better	habits
sometimes	a	habit	will	be	hard	to	remember	and	you will	need	to	make	it
obvious	other	times	you	will not	feel	like	starting	and	you will	need	to
make	it	attractive	in	many	cases	you	may	find	that	a	habit	will	be	too
difficult	and	you will	need	to	make	it	easy	and	sometimes	you	will not	feel
like	sticking	with	it	and	you will	need	to	make	it	satisfying

behaviors	are	effortless	here

behaviors	are	difficult	here

obvious

you	want	to	push	your	good	habits	toward	the	left	side	of	the	spectrum	by
making	them	obvious	attractive	easy	and	satisfying	meanwhile	you	want
to	cluster	your	bad	habits	toward	the	right	side	by	making	them	invisible
unattractive	hard	and	unsatisfying

this	is	a	continuous	process	there	is	no	finish	line	there	is	no
permanent	solution	whenever	you are	looking	to	improve	you	can
rotate	through	the	four	laws	of	behavior	change	until	you	find	the
next	bottleneck	make	it	obvious	make	it	attractive	make	it	easy
make	it	satisfying	round	and	round	always	looking	for	the	next	way
to	get	1	percent	better

the	secret	to	getting	results	that	last	is	to	never	stop	making
improvements	its	remarkable	what	you	can	build	if	you	just	do not

stop	its	remarkable	the	business	you	can	build	if	you	do not	stop
working	its	remarkable	the	body	you	can	build	if	you	do not	stop
training	its	remarkable	the	knowledge	you	can	build	if	you	do not	stop

saving	its	remarkable	the	friendships	you	can	build	if	you	do not	stop

little	lessons	from	the	four	laws

i

n	this	book	i	have	introduced	a	fourstep	model	for	human	behavior

how	to	create	new	habits	but	also	reveals	some	interesting	insights
about	human	behavior

problem	phase

solution	phase

in	this	section	i	have	compiled	some	lessons	and	a	few	bits	of
common	sense	that	are	confirmed	by	the	model	the	purpose	of	these
examples	is	to	clarify	just	how	useful	and	wideranging	this	framework
is	when	describing	human	behavior	once	you	understand	the	model
you will	see	examples	of	it	everywhere

awareness	comes	before	desire	a	craving	is	created	when	you
assign	meaning	to	a	cue	your	brain	constructs	an	emotion	or	feeling	to
describe	your	current	situation	and	that	means	a	craving	can	only
occur	after	you	have	noticed	an	opportunity

happiness	is	simply	the	absence	of	desire	when	you	observe

a	cue	but	do	not	desire	to	change	your	state	you	are	content	with	the
current	situation	happiness	is	not	about	the	achievement	of	pleasure
which	is	joy	or	satisfaction	but	about	the	lack	of	desire	it	arrives
when	you	have	no	urge	to	feel	differently	happiness	is	the	state	you
enter	when	you	no	longer	want	to	change	your	state

however	happiness	is	fleeting	because	a	new	desire	always	comes

along	as	caed	budris	says	happiness	is	the	space	between	one

desire	being	fulfilled	and	a	new	desire	forming	likewise	suffering	is
the	space	between	craving	a	change	in	state	and	getting	it

it	is	the	idea	of	pleasure	that	we	chase	we	seek	the	image	of

pleasure	that	we	generate	in	our	minds	at	the	time	of	action	we	do
not	know	what	it	will	be	like	to	attain	that	image	or	even	if	it	will
satisfy	us	the	feeling	of	satisfaction	only	comes	afterward	this	is
what	the	austrian	neurologist	victor	frankl	meant	when	he	said	that
happiness	cannot	be	pursued	it	must	ensue	desire	is	pursued
pleasure	ensues	from	action

peace	occurs	when	you	do not	turn	your	observations	into
problems	the	first	step	in	any	behavior	is	observation	you	notice	a
cue	a	bit	of	information	an	event	if	you	do	not	desire	to	act	on	what
you	observe	then	you	are	at	peace

craving	is	about	wanting	to	fix	everything	observation	without
craving	is	the	realization	that	you	do	not	need	to	fix	anything	your
desires	are	not	running	rampant	you	do	not	crave	a	change	in	state
your	mind	does	not	generate	a	problem	for	you	to	solve	you are	simply
observing	and	existing

with	a	big	enough	why	you	can	overcome	any	how
friedrich	nietzsche	the	german	philosopher	and	poet	famously
wrote	he	who	has	a	why	to	live	for	can	bear	almost	any	how	this
phrase	harbors	an	important	truth	about	human	behavior	if	your
motivation	and	desire	are	great	enough	that	is	why	are	you	are
acting	you will	take	action	even	when	it	is	quite	difficult	great	craving
can	power	great	actioneven	when	friction	is	high

being	curious	is	better	than	being	smart	being	motivated

and	curious	counts	for	more	than	being	smart	because	it	leads	to
action	being	smart	will	never	deliver	results	on	its	own	because	it
does not	get	you	to	act	it	is	desire	not	intelligence	that	prompts
behavior	as	naval	ravikant	says	the	trick	to	doing	anything	is	first
cultivating	a	desire	for	it

emotions	drive	behavior	every	decision	is	an	emotional
decision	at	some	level	whatever	your	logical	reasons	are	for	taking
action	you	only	feel	compelled	to	act	on	them	because	of	emotion	in
fact	people	with	damage	to	emotional	centers	of	the	brain	can	list
many	reasons	for	taking	action	but	still	will	not	act	because	they	do	not

have	emotions	to	drive	them	this	is	why	craving	comes	before
response	the	feeling	comes	first	and	then	the	behavior

we	can	only	be	rational	and	logical	after	we	have	been
emotional	the	primary	mode	of	the	brain	is	to	feel	the	secondary
mode	is	to	think	our	first	responsethe	fast	nonconscious	portion	of
the	brainis	optimized	for	feeling	and	anticipating	our	second
responsethe	slow	conscious	portion	of	the	brainis	the	part	that
does	the	thinking

psychologists	refer	to	this	as	system	1	feelings	and	rapid

judgments	versus	system	2	rational	analysis	the	feeling	comes	first
system	1	the	rationality	only	intervenes	later	system	2	this	works
great	when	the	two	are	aligned	but	it	results	in	illogical	and	emotional
thinking	when	they	are	not

your	response	tends	to	follow	your	emotions	our	thoughts

and	actions	are	rooted	in	what	we	find	attractive	not	necessarily	in
what	is	logical	two	people	can	notice	the	same	set	of	facts	and
respond	very	differently	because	they	run	those	facts	through	their
unique	emotional	filter	this	is	one	reason	why	appealing	to	emotion	is
typically	more	powerful	than	appealing	to	reason	if	a	topic	makes
someone	feel	emotional	they	will	rarely	be	interested	in	the	data	this
is	why	emotions	can	be	such	a	threat	to	wise	decision	making

put	another	way	most	people	believe	that	the	reasonable	response

is	the	one	that	benefits	them	the	one	that	satisfies	their	desires	to
approach	a	situation	from	a	more	neutral	emotional	position	allows
you	to	base	your	response	on	the	data	rather	than	the	emotion

suffering	drives	progress	the	source	of	all	suffering	is	the
desire	for	a	change	in	state	this	is	also	the	source	of	all	progress	the
desire	to	change	your	state	is	what	powers	you	to	take	action	it	is
wanting	more	that	pushes	humanity	to	seek	improvements	develop
new	technologies	and	reach	for	a	higher	level	with	craving	we	are
dissatisfied	but	driven	without	craving	we	are	satisfied	but	lack
ambition

your	actions	reveal	how	badly	you	want	something	if	you

keep	saying	something	is	a	priority	but	you	never	act	on	it	then	you
do not	really	want	it	its	time	to	have	an	honest	conversation	with
yourself	your	actions	reveal	your	true	motivations

reward	is	on	the	other	side	of	sacrifice	response	sacrifice	of

energy	always	precedes	reward	the	collection	of	resources	the
runners	high	only	comes	after	the	hard	run	the	reward	only	comes
after	the	energy	is	spent

selfcontrol	is	difficult	because	it	is	not	satisfying	a	reward

is	an	outcome	that	satisfies	your	craving	this	makes	selfcontrol
ineffective	because	inhibiting	our	desires	does	not	usually	resolve
them	resisting	temptation	does	not	satisfy	your	craving	it	just
ignores	it	it	creates	space	for	the	craving	to	pass	selfcontrol	requires
you	to	release	a	desire	rather	than	satisfy	it

our	expectations	determine	our	satisfaction	the	gap

between	our	cravings	and	our	rewards	determines	how	satisfied	we	feel
after	taking	action	if	the	mismatch	between	expectations	and
outcomes	is	positive	surprise	and	delight	then	we	are	more	likely	to
repeat	a	behavior	in	the	future	if	the	mismatch	is	negative
disappointment	and	frustration	then	we	are	less	likely	to	do	so

for	example	if	you	expect	to	get	10	and	get	100	you	feel	great	if

you	expect	to	get	100	and	get	10	you	feel	disappointed	your
expectation	changes	your	satisfaction	an	average	experience	preceded
by	high	expectations	is	a	disappointment	an	average	experience
preceded	by	low	expectations	is	a	delight	when	liking	and	wanting	are
approximately	the	same	you	feel	satisfied

satisfaction		liking		wanting

this	is	the	wisdom	behind	senecas	famous	quote	being	poor	is
not	having	too	little	it	is	wanting	more	if	your	wants	outpace	your
likes	you will	always	be	unsatisfied	you are	perpetually	putting	more
weight	on	the	problem	than	the	solution

happiness	is	relative	when	i	first	began	sharing	my	writing
publicly	it	took	me	three	months	to	get	one	thousand	subscribers
when	i	hit	that	milestone	i	told	my	parents	and	my	girlfriend	we
celebrated	i	felt	excited	and	motivated	a	few	years	later	i	realized
that	one	thousand	people	were	signing	up	each	day	and	yet	i	did not
even	think	to	tell	anyone	it	felt	normal	i	was	getting	results	ninety
times	faster	than	before	but	experiencing	little	pleasure	over	it	it
was not	until	a	few	days	later	that	i	realized	how	absurd	it	was	that	i
was not	celebrating	something	that	would	have	seemed	like	a	pipe
dream	just	a	few	years	before

the	pain	of	failure	correlates	to	the	height	of	expectation
when	desire	is	high	it	hurts	to	not	like	the	outcome	failing	to	attain
something	you	want	hurts	more	than	failing	to	attain	something	you
did not	think	much	about	in	the	first	place	this	is	why	people	say	i
do not	want	to	get	my	hopes	up

feelings	come	both	before	and	after	the	behavior	before
acting	there	is	a	feeling	that	motivates	you	to	actthe	craving	after
acting	there	is	a	feeling	that	teaches	you	to	repeat	the	action	in	the
futurethe	reward

cue		craving	feeling		response		reward	feeling

how	we	feel	influences	how	we	act	and	how	we	act	influences	how

we	feel

desire	initiates	pleasure	sustains	wanting	and	liking	are	the

two	drivers	of	behavior	if	its	not	desirable	you	have	no	reason	to	do
it	desire	and	craving	are	what	initiate	a	behavior	but	if	its	not
enjoyable	you	have	no	reason	to	repeat	it	pleasure	and	satisfaction
are	what	sustain	a	behavior	feeling	motivated	gets	you	to	act	feeling
successful	gets	you	to	repeat

hope	declines	with	experience	and	is	replaced	by

acceptance	the	first	time	an	opportunity	arises	there	is	hope	of
what	could	be	your	expectation	cravings	is	based	solely	on	promise
the	second	time	around	your	expectation	is	grounded	in	reality	you
begin	to	understand	how	the	process	works	and	your	hope	is	gradually
traded	for	a	more	accurate	prediction	and	acceptance	of	the	likely
outcome

this	is	one	reason	why	we	continually	grasp	for	the	latest	getrich
quick	or	weightloss	scheme	new	plans	offer	hope	because	we	do not
have	any	experiences	to	ground	our	expectations	new	strategies	seem
more	appealing	than	old	ones	because	they	can	have	unbounded	hope
as	aristotle	noted	youth	is	easily	deceived	because	it	is	quick	to
hope	perhaps	this	can	be	revised	to	youth	is	easily	deceived	because
it	only	hopes	there	is	no	experience	to	root	the	expectation	in	in	the
beginning	hope	is	all	you	have

how	to	apply	these	ideas	to	business

o

ver	the	years	i have	spoken	at	fortune	500	companies	and	growing
startups	about	how	to	apply	the	science	of	small	habits	to	run
more	effective	businesses	and	build	better	products	i have	compiled
many	of	the	most	practical	strategies	into	a	short	bonus	chapter	i
think	you will	find	it	to	be	an	incredibly	useful	addition	to	the	main	ideas

of	human	behavior	teenagers	are	humans	too	which	means	you
should	find	plenty	of	useful	strategies	in	the	main	text	that	said

the	importance	of	dopamine	the	importance	of	dopamine	was	discovered	by	accident

in	1954	james	olds	and	peter	milner	two	neuroscientists	at	mcgill	university	decided
to	implant	an	electrode	deep	into	the	center	of	a	rats	brain	the	precise	placement	of
the	electrode	was	largely	happenstance	at	the	time	the	geography	of	the	mind
remained	a	mystery	but	olds	and	milner	got	lucky	they	inserted	the	needle	right	next
to	the	nucleus	accumbens	nacc	a	part	of	the	brain	that	generates	pleasurable	feelings
whenever	you	eat	a	piece	of	chocolate	cake	or	listen	to	a	favorite	pop	song	or	watch
your	favorite	team	win	the	world	series	it	is	your	nacc	that	helps	you	feel	so	happy
but	olds	and	milner	quickly	discovered	that	too	much	pleasure	can	be	fatal	they	placed
the	electrodes	in	several	rodents	brains	and	then	ran	a	small	current	into	each	wire

making	the	naccs	continually	excited	the	scientists	noticed	that	the	rodents	lost
interest	in	everything	they	stopped	eating	and	drinking	all	courtship	behavior	ceased

	the	terms	unconscious	nonconscious	and	subconscious
can	all	be	used	to	describe	the	absence	of	awareness	or
thought	even	in	academic	circles	these	words	are	often	used
interchangeably	without	much	nitpicking	for	once
nonconscious	is	the	term	i am	going	to	use	because	it	is	broad
enough	to	encompass	both	the	processes	of	the	mind	we
could	never	consciously	access	and	the	moments	when	we	are
simply	not	paying	attention	to	what	surrounds	us
nonconscious	is	a	description	of	anything	you	are	not

	certainly	there	are	some	aspects	of	your	identity	that	tend
to	remain	unchanged	over	timelike	identifying	as	someone
who	is	tall	or	short	but	even	for	more	fixed	qualities	and
characteristics	whether	you	view	them	in	a	positive	or
negative	light	is	determined	by	your	experiences	throughout
life

	readers	of	the	power	of	habit	by	charles	duhigg	will
recognize	these	terms	duhigg	wrote	a	great	book	and	my
intention	is	to	pick	up	where	he	left	off	by	integrating	these
stages	into	four	simple	laws	you	can	apply	to	build	better
habits	in	life	and	work

	charles	duhigg	and	nir	eyal	deserve	special	recognition	for
their	influence	on	this	image	this	representation	of	the	habit
loop	is	a	combination	of	language	that	was	popularized	by

popularized	by	eyals	book	hooked

	when	i	visited	japan	i	saw	this	strategy	save	a	womans
life	her	young	son	stepped	onto	the	shinkansen	one	of
japans	famous	bullet	trains	that	travel	at	over	two	hundred
miles	per	hour	just	as	the	doors	were	closing	she	was	left
outside	on	the	platform	and	jammed	her	arm	through	the
door	to	grab	him	with	her	arm	stuck	in	the	door	the	train
was	about	to	take	off	but	right	before	it	pulled	away	an
employee	performed	a	safety	check	by	pointingandcalling
up	and	down	the	platform	in	less	than	five	seconds	he
noticed	the	woman	and	managed	to	stop	the	train	from
leaving	the	door	opened	the	womannow	in	tearsran	to

	dopamine	is	not	the	only	chemical	that	influences	your
habits	every	behavior	involves	multiple	brain	regions	and
neurochemicals	and	anyone	who	claims	that	habits	are	all
about	dopamine	is	skipping	over	major	portions	of	the
process	it	is	just	one	of	the	important	role	players	in	habit
formation	however	i	will	single	out	the	dopamine	circuit	in
this	chapter	because	it	provides	a	window	into	the	biological
underpinnings	of	desire	craving	and	motivation	that	are
behind	every	habit

	i am	so	happy	i	was	able	to	fit	a	game	of	thrones	reference
into	this	book

bayles	and	ted	orland	it	has	been	adapted	here	with
permission	see	the	endnotes	for	a	full	explanation

	this	is	a	foundational	principle	in	physics	where	it	is
known	as	the	principle	of	least	action	it	states	that	the	path
followed	between	any	two	points	will	always	be	the	path
requiring	the	least	energy	this	simple	principle	underpins
the	laws	of	the	universe	from	this	one	idea	you	can	describe
the	laws	of	motion	and	relativity

	the	phrase	addition	by	subtraction	is	also	used	by	teams
and	businesses	to	describe	removing	people	from	a	group	in
order	to	make	the	team	stronger	overall

	to	be	fair	this	still	sounds	like	an	amazing	night

	i	designed	a	habit	journal	specifically	to	make	journaling
easier	it	includes	a	one	line	per	day	section	where	you

	the	irony	of	how	closely	this	story	matches	my	process	of
writing	this	book	is	not	lost	on	me	although	my	publisher
was	much	more	accommodating	and	my	closet	remained
full	i	did	feel	like	i	had	to	place	myself	on	house	arrest	to
finish	the	manuscript

	this	is	also	referred	to	as	a	ulysses	pact	or	a	ulysses
contract	named	after	ulysses	the	hero	of	the	odyssey	who
told	his	sailors	to	tie	him	to	the	mast	of	the	ship	so	that	he
could	hear	the	enchanting	song	of	the	sirens	but	would not	be
able	to	steer	the	ship	toward	them	and	crash	on	the	rocks
ulysses	realized	the	benefits	of	locking	in	your	future	actions

preface 
this book is primarily designed to be a sequel to my book transnational analysis in 
psychotherapy1 but has been planned so that it can be read and understood independently the 
theory necessary for the analysis and clear understanding of games has been summarized in part i 
part ii contains descriptions of the individual games part iii contains new clinical and theoretical 
material which added to the old makes it possible to understand to some extent what it means to 
be gamefree those desiring further background are referred to the earlier volume the reader of 
both will note that in addition to the theoretical advances there have been some minor changes in 
terminology and viewpoint based on further thinking and reading and new clinical material 
the need for this book was indicated by interested requests from students and lecture audiences for 
lists of games or for further elaboration of games mentioned briefly as examples in a general 
exposition of the principles of transactional analysis thanks are due in general to these students 
and audiences and especially to the many patients who exposed to view spotted or named new 
games and in particular to miss barbara rosenfeld for her many ideas about the art and meaning 
of listening and to mr melvin boyce mr joseph concannon dr franklin ernst dr kenneth 
everts dr gordon gritter mrs frances matson and dr ray poindexter among others for their 
independent discovery or confirmation of the significance of many games 
mr claude steiner formerly research director of the san francisco social psychiatry seminars 
and presently in the department of psychology at the university of michigan deserves special 
mention on two counts he conducted the first experiments which confirmed many of the 
theoretical points at issue here and as a result of these experiments he helped considerably in 
clarifying the nature of autonomy and of intimacy thanks are also due to miss viola lilt the 
secretarytreasurer of the seminars and to mrs mary n williams my personal secretary for 
their continued help and to anne garrett for her assistance in reading the proof 

semantics 
for conciseness the games are described primarily from the male point of view unless they are 
clearly feminine thus the chief player is usually designated as he but without prejudice since 
the same situation unless otherwise indicated could as easily be outlined with she mutatis 
mutandis if the womans role differs significantly from the mans it is treated separately the 
therapist is similarly without prejudice designated as he the vocabulary and viewpoint are 
primarily oriented toward the practicing clinician but members of other professions may find this 
book interesting or useful 
transactional game analysis should be clearly distinguished from its growing sister science of 
mathematical game analysis although a few of the terms used in the text such as payoff are now 
respectably mathematical for a detailed review of the mathematical theory of games see games  
decisions by r d luce and h raiffa 
carmel california may 1962

introduction 

1 social intercourse 
the theory of social intercourse which has been outlined at some length in transnational analysis 
may be summarized as follows 
spitz has found that infants deprived of handling over a long period will tend at length to sink into 
an irreversible decline and are prone to succumb eventually to intercurrent disease in effect this 
means that what he calls emotional deprivation can have a fatal outcome these observations give 
rise to the idea of stimulushunger and indicate that the most favored forms of stimuli are those 
provided by physical intimacy a conclusion not hard to accept on the basis of everyday experience 
an allied phenomenon is seen in grownups subjected to sensory deprivation experimentally such 
deprivation may call forth a transient psychosis or at least give rise to temporary mental 
disturbances in the past social and sensory deprivation is noted to have had similar effects in 
individuals condemned to long periods of solitary imprisonment indeed solitary confinement is 
one of the punishments most dreaded even by prisoners hardened to physical brutality and is now a 
notorious procedure for inducing political compliance conversely the best of the known weapons 
against compliance is social organization 
on that biological side it is probable that emotional and sensory deprivation tends to bring about or 
encourage organic changes if the reticular activating system8 of the brain stem is not sufficiently 
stimulated degenerative changes in the nerve cells may follow at least indirectly this may be a 
secondary effect due to poor nutrition but the poor nutrition itself may be a product of apathy as in 
infants suffering from marasmus hence a biological chain may he postulated leading from 
emotional and sensory deprivation through apathy to degenerative changes and death in this sense 
stimulushunger has the same relationship to survival of the human organism as foodhunger 
indeed not only biologically but also psychologically and socially stimulushunger in many ways 
parallels the hunger for food such terms as malnutrition satiation gourmet gourmand faddist 
ascetic culinary arts and good cook are easily transferred from the field of nutrition to the field of 
sensation overstuffing has its parallel in overstimulation in both spheres under ordinary 
conditions where ample supplies are available and a diversified menu is possible choices will be 
heavily influenced by an individuals idiosyncrasies it is possible that some or many of these 
idiosyncrasies are constitutionally determined but this is irrelevant to the problems at issue here 
the social psychiatrists concern in the matter is with what happens after the infant is separated 
from his mother in the normal course of growth what has been said so far may be summarized by 
the colloquialism7 if you are not stroked your spinal cord will shrivel up hence after the 
period of close intimacy with the mother is over the individual for the rest of his life is confronted 
with a dilemma upon whose horns his destiny and survival are continually being tossed one born 
is the social psychological and biological forces which stand in the way of continued physical 
intimacy in the infant style the other is his perpetual striving for its attainment under most 
conditions he will compromise he learns to do with more subtle even symbolic forms of handling 
until the merest nod of recognition may serve the purpose to some extent although his original 
craving for physical contact may remain unabated 
this process of compromise may be called by various terms such as sublimation but whatever it is 
called the result is a partial transformation of the infantile stimulushunger into something which 
may be termed recognitionhunger as the complexities of compromise increase each person 
becomes more and more individual in his quest for recognition and it is these differentia which 
lend variety to social intercourse and which determine the individuals destiny a movie actor may 
require hundreds of strokes each week from anonymous and undifferentiated admirers to keep his 
spinal cord from shriveling while a scientist may keep physically and mentally healthy on one 
stroke a year from a respected master 
stroking may be used as a general term for intimate physical contact in practice it may take 
various forms some people literally stroke an infant others hug or pat it while some people pinch

it playfully or flip it with a fingertip these all have their analogues in conversation so that it seems 
one might predict how an individual would handle a baby by listening to him talk by an extension 
of meaning stroking may be employed colloquially to denote any act implying recognition of 
anothers presence hence a stroke may be used as the fundamental unit of social action an 
exchange of strokes constitutes a transaction which is the unit of social intercourse 
as far as the theory of games is concerned the principle which emerges here is that any social 
intercourse whatever has a biological advantage over no intercourse at all this has been 
experimentally demonstrated in the case of rats through some remarkable experiments by s levine 
8 in which not only physical mental and emotional development but also the biochemistry of the 
brain and even resistance to leukemia were favorably affected by handling the significant feature 
of these experiments was that gentle handling and painful electric shocks were equally effective in 
promoting the health of the animals 
this validation of what has been said above encourages us to proceed with increased confidence to 
the next section 

2 the structuring of time  
granted that handling of infants and its symbolic equivalent in grownups recognition have a 
survival value the question is what next in everyday terms what can people do after they have 
exchanged greetings whether the greeting consists of a collegiate hi or an oriental ritual lasting 
several hours after stimulushunger and recognitionhunger comes structurehunger the 
perennial problem of adolescents is what do you say to her him then and to many people 
besides adolescents nothing is more uncomfortable than a social hiatus a period of silent 
unstructured time when no one present can think of anything more interesting to say than do not 
you think the walls are perpendicular tonight the eternal problem of the human being is how to 
structure his waking hours in this existential sense the function of all social living is to lend 
mutual assistance for this project 
the operational aspect of timestructuring may be called programming in has three aspects 
material social and individual the most common convenient comfortable and utilitarian method 
of structuring time is by a project designed to deal with the material of external reality what is 
commonly known as work such a project is technically called an activity the term work is 
unsuitable because a general theory of social psychiatry must recognize that social intercourse is 
also a form of work 
material programming arises from the vicissitudes encountered in dealing with external reality it is 
of interest here only insofar as activities offer a matrix for stroking recognition and other more 
complex forms of social intercourse material programming is not primarily a social problem in 
essence it is based on data processing the activity of building a boat relies on a long series of 
measurements and probability estimates and any social exchange which occurs must be 
subordinated to these in order for the building to proceed 
social programming results in traditional ritualistic or semiritualistic interchanges the chief 
criterion for it is local acceptability popularity called good manners parents in all parts of the 
world teach their children manners which means that they know the proper greeting eating  
courting and mourning rituals and also how to carry on topical conversations with appropriate 
strictures and reinforcements the strictures and reinforcements constitute tact or diplomacy some 
of which is universal and some local belching at meals or asking after another mans wife are each 
encouraged or forbidden by local ancestral tradition and indeed there is a high degree of inverse 
correlation between these particular transactions usually in localities where people belch at meals 
it is unwise to ask after the womenfolk and in localities where people are asking after the 
womenfolk it is unwise to belch at meals usually formal rituals precede semiritualistic topical 
conversations and the latter may be distinguished by calling them pastimes 
as people become better acquainted more and more individual programming creeps in so that 
incidents begin to occur these incidents superficially appear to be adventitious and may be so 
described by the parties concerned but careful scrutiny reveals that they tend to follow definite 

5

 
patterns which are amenable to sorting and classification and that the sequence is circumscribed by 
unspoken rules and regulations these regulations remain latent as long as the amities or hostilities 
proceed according to hoyle but they become manifest if an illegal move is made giving rise to a 
symbolic verbal or legal cry of foul such sequences which in contrast to pastimes are based 
more on individual than on social programming may be called games family life and married life 
as well as life in organizations of various kinds may year after year be based on variations of the 
same game 
to say that the bulk of social activity consists of playing games does not necessarily mean that it is 
mostly fun or that the parties are not seriously engaged in the relationship on the one hand 
playing football and other athletic games may not be fun at all and the players may be 
intensely grim and such games share with gambling and other forms of play the potentiality for 
being very serious indeed sometimes fatal on the other hand some authors for instance huizinga 
9 include under play such serious things as cannibal feasts hence calling such tragic behavior as 
suicide alcohol and drug addiction criminality or schizophrenia playing games is not 
irresponsible facetious or barbaric the essential characteristic of human play is not that the 
emotions are spurious but that they are regulated this is revealed when sanctions are imposed on 
an illegitimate emotional display play may be grimly serious or even fatally serious but the social 
sanctions are serious only if the rules are broken 
pastimes and games are substitutes for the real living of real intimacy because of this they may be 
regarded as preliminary engagements rather than as unions which is why they are characterized as 
poignant forms of play intimacy begins when individual usually instinctual programming 
becomes more intense and both social patterning and ulterior restrictions and motives begin to give 
way it is the only completely satisfying answer to stimulushunger recognitionhunger and 
structurehunger its prototype is the act of loving impregnation 
structurehunger has the same survival value as stimulushunger stimulushunger and recognition
hunger express the need to avoid sensory and emotional starvation both of which lead to biological 
deterioration structurehunger expresses the need to avoid boredom and kierkegaard10 has 
pointed out the evils which result from unstructured time if it persists for any length of time 
boredom becomes synonymous with emotional starvation and can have the same consequences 
the solitary individual can structure time in two ways activity and fantasy an individual can 
remain solitary even in the presence of others as every schoolteacher knows when one is a 
member of a social aggregation of two or more people there are several options for structuring 
time in order of complexity these are 1 rituals 2 pastimes 3 games 4 intimacy and 5 
activity which may form a matrix for any of the others the goal of each member of the 
aggregation is to obtain as many satisfactions as possible from his transactions with other members 
the more accessible he is the more satisfactions he can obtain most of the programming of his 
social operations is automatic since some of the satisfactions obtained under this programming 
such as selfdestructive ones are difficult to recognize in the usual sense of the word 
satisfactions it would be better to substitute some more noncommittal terra such as gains or 
advantages 
the advantages of social contact revolve around somatic and psychic equilibrium they are related 
to the following factors 1 the relief of tension 2 the avoidance of noxious situations 3 the 
procurement of stroking and 4 the maintenance of an established equilibrium all these items 
have been investigated and discussed in great detail by physiologists psychologists and 
psychoanalysts translated into terms of social psychiatry they may be stated as 1 the primary 
internal advantages 2 the primary external advantages 3 the secondary advantages and 4 the 
existential advantages the first three parallel the gains from illness described by freud the 
internal paranosic gain the external paranosic gain and the eplnosic gain respectively11 
experience has shown that it is more useful and enlightening to investigate social transactions from 
the point of view of the advantages gained than to treat them as defensive operations in the first 
place the best defense is to engage in no transactions at all in the second place the concept of 

6

 
defenses covers only part of the first two classes of advantages and the rest of them together 
with the third and fourth classes are lost to this point of view 
the most gratifying forms of social contact whether or not they are embedded in a matrix of 
activity are games and intimacy prolonged intimacy is rare and even then it is primarily a private 
matter significant social intercourse most commonly takes the form of games and that is the 
subject which principally concerns us here for further information about rimestructuring the 
authors book on group dynamics should be consulted

chapter one 
structural analysis 
observation of spontaneous social activity most productively carried out in certain kinds of 
psychotherapy groups reveals that from time to time people show noticeable changes in posture 
viewpoint voice vocabulary and other aspects of behavior these behavioral changes are often 
accompanied by shifts in feeling in given individual a certain patterns correspond to one state of 
mind while another set is related to a different psychic attitude often inconsistent with the first 
these changes and differences give rise to the idea of ego states 
in technical language an ego state may be described phenomenologically as a coherent system of 
feelings and operationally as a set of coherent behavior patterns in more practical terms it is a 
system of feelings accompanied by a related set of behavior patterns each individual seems to have 
available a limited repertoire of such ego states which are not roles but psychological realities 
this repertoire can be sorted into the following categories co ego states which resemble those of 
parental figures 2 ego states which are autonomously directed toward objective appraisal of 
reality and b those which represent archaic relics stillactive ego states which were fixated in 
early childhood technically these are called respectively exteropsychic neopsychic and 
archaeopsychic ego states colloquially their exhibitions are called parent adult and child and 
these simple terms serve for all but the most formal discussions 
the position is then that at any given moment each individual in a social aggregation will exhibit 
a parental adult or child ego state and that individuals can shift with varying degrees of readiness 
from one ego state to another these observations give rise to certain diagnostic statements that 
is your parent means you are now in the same state of mind as one of your parents or a parental 
substitute used to be and you are responding as he would with the same posture gestures 
vocabulary feelings etc that is your adult means you have just made an autonomous 
objective appraisal of the situation and are stating these thoughtprocesses or the problems you 
perceive or the conclusions you have come to in a nonprejudicial manner that is your child 
means the manner and intent of your reaction is the same as it would have been when you were a 
very little boy or girl the implications are 
1 that every individual has had parents or substitute parents and that he carries within him a set 
of ego states that reproduce the ego states of those parents as he perceived them and that these 
parental ego states can be activated under certain circumstances exteropsychic functioning 
colloquially everyone carries his parents around inside of him 
2 that every individual including children the mentally retarded and schizophrenics is capable 
of objective data processing if the appropriate ego state can be activated neopsychic functioning 
colloquially everyone has an adult 
3 that every individual was once younger than he is now and that he carries within him fixated 
relics from earlier years which will be activated under certain circumstances archaeopsychic 
functioning colloquially everyone carries a little boy or girl around inside of him 
at this point it is appropriate to draw figure i a which is called a structural diagram this 
represents from the present viewpoint a diagram of the complete personality of any individual it 
includes his parental adult and child ego states they are carefully segregated from each other 
because they are so different and because they are so often quite inconsistent with each other the 
distinctions may not be clear at first to an inexperienced observer but soon become impressive and 
interesting to anyone who takes the trouble to learn structural diagnosis it will be convenient 
henceforth to call actual people parents adults or children with no capital letters parent adult and 
child capitalized will be used when ego states are referred to figure 1b represents a convenient 
simplified form of the structural diagram

before we leave the subject of structural analysis certain complications should be mentioned 
1 the word childish is never used in structural analysis since it has come to have strong 
connotations of undesirability and of something to be stopped forthwith or gotten rid of the term 
childlike is used in describing the child an archaic ego state since it is more biological and not 
prejudicial actually the child is in many ways the most valuable part of the personality and can 
contribute to the individuals life exactly what an actual child can contribute to family life charm 
pleasure and creativity if the child in the individual is confused and unhealthy then the 
consequences may be unfortunate but something can and should be done about it 
2 the same applies to the words mature and immature in this system there is no such thing as 
an immature person there are only people in whom the child takes over inappropriately or 
unproductively but all such people have a complete wellstructured adult which only needs to be 
uncovered or activated conversely socalled mature people are people who are able to keep the 
adult in control most of the time but their child will take over on occasion like anyone elses 
often with disconcerting results 
3 it should be noted that the parent is exhibited in two forms direct and indirect as an active ego 
state and as an influence when it is directly active the person responds as his own father or 
mother actually responded do as i do when it is an indirect influence he responds the way 
they wanted him to respond do not do as i do do as i say in the first case he becomes one of 
them in the second he adapts himself to their requirements 
4 thus the child is also exhibited in two forms the adapted child and the natural child the 
adapted child is the one who modifies his behavior under the parental influence he behaves as 
father or mother wanted him to behave compliantly or precociously for example or he adapts 
himself by withdrawing or whining thus the parental influence is a because and the adapted child 
an effect the natural child is a spontaneous expression rebellion or creativity for example a 
confirmation of structural analysis is seen in the results of alcohol intoxication usually this 
decommissions the parent first so that the adapted child is freed of the parental influence and is 
transformed by release into the natural child 
it is seldom necessary for effective game analysis to go beyond what has been outlined above as 
far as personality structure is concerned 
ego states are normal physiological phenomena the human brain is the organ or organizer of 
psychic life and its products ate organized and stored in the form of ego states there is already 
concrete evidence for this in some findings of penfield and his associates12 there are other 
sorting systems at various levels such as factual memory but the natural form of experience itself 
is in shifting states of mind each type of ego state has its own vital value for the human organism

in the child reside intuition3 creativity and spontaneous drive and enjoyment 
the adult is necessary for survival it processes data and computes the probabilities which are 
essential for dealing effectively with the outside world it also experiences its own kinds of 
setbacks and gratifications crossing a busy highway for example requires the processing of a 
complex series of velocity data action is suspended until the computations indicate a high degree 
of probability for reaching the other side safely the gratifications offered by successful 
computations of this type afford some of the joys of skiing flying sailing and other mobile sports 
another task of the adult is to regulate the activities of the parent and the child and to mediate 
objectively between them 
the parent has two main functions first it enables the individual to act effectively as the parent of 
actual children thus promoting the survival of the human race its value in this respect is shown by 
the fact that in raising children people orphaned in infancy seem to have a harder time than those 
from homes unbroken into adolescence secondly it makes many responses automatic which 
conserves a great deal of time and energy many things are done because that is the way its done 
this frees the adult from the necessity of making innumerable trivial decisions so that it can 
devote itself to more important issues leaving routine matters to the parent thus all three aspects 
of the personality have a high survival and living value and it is only when one or the other of 
them disturbs the healthy balance that analysis and reorganization are indicated otherwise each of 
them parent adult and child have right to be respected each has legitimate place in a full and 
productive life

chapter two 
transactional analysis 
the unit of social intercourse is called a transaction if two or more people encounter each other in 
a social aggregation sooner or later one of them will speak or give some other indication of 
acknowledging the presence of the others this is called the transactional stimulus another person 
will then say or do something which is in some way related to this stimulus and that is called the 
transactions response simple transactional analysis is concerned with diagnosing which ego state 
implemented the transactional stimulus and which one executed the transactional response the 
simplest transactions are those in which both stimulus and response arise from the adults of the 
parties concerned the agent estimating from the data before him that a scalpel is now the 
instrument of choice holds out his hand the respondent appraises this gesture correctly estimates 
the forces and distances involved and places the handle of the scalpel exactly where the surgeon 
expects it next in simplicity are childparent transactions the fevered child asks for a glass of 
water and the nurturing mother brings it 
both these transactions are complementary that is the response is appropriate and expected and 
follows the natural order of healthy human relationships the first which is classified as 
complementary transaction type i is represented in figure 2a the second complementary 
transaction type ii is shown in figure 2b it is evident however that transactions tend to proceed 
in chains so that each response is in mm a stimulus the first rule of communication is that 
communication will proceed smoothly as long as transactions are complementary and its corollary 
is that as long as transactions are complementary communication can in principle proceed 
indefinitely these rules are independent of the nature and content of the transactions they are 
based entirely on the direction of the vectors involved as long as the transactions are

the converse rule is that communication is broken off when a crossed transaction occurs the most 
common crossed transaction and the one which causes and always has caused most of the social 
difficulties in the world whether in marriage love friendship or work is represented in figure 3a 
as crossed transaction type i this type of transaction is the principal concern of psychotherapists 
and is typified by the classical transference reaction of psychoanalysis the stimulus is adultadult 
eg maybe we should find out why you have been drinking more lately or do you know where 
my cuff links are the appropriate adultadult response in each case would be maybe we 
should id certainly like to know or on the desk if the respondent flares up however the 
responses will be something like you are always criticizing me just like my father did or you 
always blame me for everything these are both childparent responses and as the transactional 
diagram shows the vectors cross in such cases the adult problems about drinking or cuff links 
must be suspended until the vectors can be realigned this may take anywhere from several months 
in the drinking example to a few seconds in the case of cuff links either the agent must become 
parental as a complement to the respondents suddenly activated child or the respondents adult 
must be reactivated as a complement to the agents adult if the maid rebels during a discussion of 
dishwashing the adultadult conversation about dishes is finished there can only ensue either a 
childparent discourse or a discussion of a different adult subject namely her continued 
employment

the converse of crossed transaction type i is illustrated in figure 3b this is the counter
transference reaction familiar to psychotherapists in which the patient makes an objective adult 
observation and the therapist crosses the vectors by responding like a parent talking to a child this 
is crossed transaction type ii in everyday life do you know where my cuff links are may 
elicit why do not you keep track of your own things you are not a child any more 
the relationship diagram in figure 4 showing the nine possible vectors of social action between an 
agent and a respondent has some interesting geometrical topological qualities complementary 
transactions between psychological equals are represented by 1 i2 552 and 992 there 
are three other complementary transactions 24 42 37 73 and 68 86 all other 
combinations form crossed transactions and in most cases these show up as crossings in the 
diagram eg 37 37 which results in two speechless people glaring at each other if neither 
of them gives way communication is finished and they must part the most common solutions are

for one to yield and take 73 which results in a game of uproar or better 552 in which 
case they both burst out laughing or shake hands simple complementary transactions most 
commonly occur in superficial working and social relationships and these are easily disturbed by 
simple crossed transactions in fact a superficial relationship may be defined as one which is 
confined to simple complementary transactions such relationships occur in activities rituals and 
pastimes more complex are ulterior transactionsthose involving the activity of more than two 
ego states simultaneouslyand this category is the basis for games salesmen are particularly adept 
at angular transactions those involving three ego states a crude but dramatic example of a sales 
game is illustrated in the following exchange 
salesman this one is better but you cannot afford it  
housewife that is the one ill take 
the analysis of this transaction is shown in figure 5a the salesman as adult states two objective 
facts this one is better and you cannot afford it at the ostensible or social level these are 
directed to the adult of the housewife whose adult reply would be you are correct on both 
counts however the ulterior or psychological vector is directed by the welltrained and 
experienced adult of the salesman to the housewifes child the correctness of his judgment is 
demonstrated by the childs reply which says in effect regardless of the financial consequences 
ill show that arrogant fellow i am as good as any of his customers at both levels the transaction is 
complementary since her reply is accepted at face value as an adult purchasing contract 
a duplex ulterior transaction involves four ego states and is commonly seen in flirtation games

as shown in figure 5b at the social level this is an adult conversation about barns and at the 
psychological level it is a child conversation about sex play on the surface the adult seems to 
have the initiative but as in most games the outcome is determined by the child and the 
participants may be in for a surprise 
transactions may be classified then as complementary or crossed simple or ulterior and ulterior 
transactions may be subdivided into angular and duplex types

chapter three 
procedures and rituals 
transactions usually proceed in series these series are not random but are programmed 
programming may come from one of three sources parent adult or child or more generally from 
society material or idiosyncrasy since the needs of adaptation require that the child may be 
shielded by the parent or adult until each social situation has been tested child programming is 
most apt to occur in situations of privacy and intimacy where preliminary testing has already been 
done 
the simplest forms of social activity are procedures and rituals some of these are universal and 
some local but all of them have to be learned a procedure is a series of simple complementary 
adult transactions directed toward the manipulation of reality reality is defined as having two 
aspects static and dynamic static reality comprises all the possible arrangements of matter in the 
universe arithmetic for example consists of statements about static reality dynamic reality may 
be defined as the potentialities for interaction of all the energy systems in the universe chemistry 
for example consists of statements about dynamic reality procedures are based on data processing 
and probability estimates concerning the material of reality and reach their highest development in 
professional techniques piloting an airplane and removing an appendix are procedures 
psychotherapy is a procedure insofar as it is under the control of the therapists adult and it is not a 
procedure insofar as his parent or child takes over the executive the programming of a procedure 
is determined by the material on the basis of estimates made by the agents adult 
two variables are used in evaluating procedures a procedure is said to be efficient when the agent 
makes the best possible use of the data and experience available to him regardless of any 
deficiencies that may exist in his knowledge if the parent or the child interferes with the adults 
data processing the procedure becomes contaminated and will be less efficient the effectiveness 
of a procedure is judged by the actual results thus efficiency is a psychological criterion and 
effectiveness is a material one a native assistant medical officer on a tropical island became very 
adept at removing cataracts he used what knowledge he had with a very high degree of efficiency 
but since he knew less than the european medical officer he was not quite as effective the 
european began to drink heavily so that his efficiency dropped but at first his effectiveness was not 
diminished but when his hands became tremulous as the years went by his assistant began to 
surpass him not only in efficiency but also in effectiveness it can be seen from this example that 
both of these variables are best evaluated by an expert in the procedures involvedefficiency by 
personal acquaintance with the agent and effectiveness by surveying the actual results 
from the present viewpoint a ritual is a stereotyped series of simple complementary transactions 
programmed by external social forces an informal ritual such as social leavetaking may be 
subject to considerable local variations in details although the basic form remains the same a 
formal ritual such as a roman catholic mass offers much less option the form of a ritual is 
parentally determined by tradition but more recent parental influences may have similar but less 
stable effects in trivial instances some formal rituals of special historical or anthropological 
interest have two phases 1 a phase in which transactions are carried on under rigid parental 
strictures 2 a phase of parental license in which the child is allowed more or less complete 
transactional freedom resulting in an orgy 
many formal rituals started off as heavily contaminated though fairly efficient procedures but as 
time passed and circumstances changed they lost all procedural validity while still retaining their 
usefulness as acts of faith transactionally they represent guiltrelieving or rewardseeking 
compliances with traditional parental demands they offer a safe reassuring apotropaic and 
often enjoyable method of structuring time 
of more significance as an introduction to game analysis are informal rituals and among the most 
instructive are the american greeting rituals

warm enough for ya how are you

well take cara yourself okay 
ill be seeing you 
so long 
so long 

it is apparent that this exchange is not intended to convey information indeed if there is any 
information it is wisely withheld it might take mr a fifteen minutes to say how he is and mr b 
who is only the most casual acquaintance has no intention of devoting that much time to listening 
to him this series of transactions is quite adequately characterized by calling it an eightstroke 
ritual if a and b were in a hurry they might both be contented with a twostroke exchange hihi 
if they were oldfashioned oriental potentates they might go through a twohundred stroke ritual 
before settling down to business meanwhile in the jargon of transactional analysis a and b have 
improved each others health slightly for the moment at least their spinal cords will not shrivel up 
and each is accordingly grateful 
this ritual is based on careful intuitive computations by both parties at this stage of their 
acquaintance they figure that they owe each other exactly four strokes at each meeting and not 
oftener than once a day if they run into each other again shortly say within the next half hour and 
have no new business to transact they will pass by without any sign or with only the slightest nod 
of recognition or at most with a very perfunctory hihi these computations hold not only for 
short intervals but over periods of several months let us now consider mr c and mr d who pass 
each other about once a day trade one stroke eachhihi and go their ways mr c goes on a 
months vacation the day after he returns he encounters mr d as usual if on this occasion mr d 
merely says hi and no more mr c will be offended his spinal cord will shrivel slightly by 
his calculations mr d and he owe each other about thirty strokes these can be compressed into a 
few transactions if those transactions are emphatic enough mr ds side properly runs something 
like this where each unit of intensity or interest is equivalent to a stroke 

id hi 1 unit 
2d have not seen you around lately 2 units  
3d oh have you where did you go 5 units  
4d say that is interesting how was it 7 units  
5d well you are sure looking fine 4 units did your family go along 4 units 
6d well glad to see you back 4 units  
7d so long i unit 

this gives mr d a total of 28 units both he and mr c know that he will make up the missing units 
the following day so the account is now for all practical purposes squared two days later they 
will be back at their twostroke exchange hihi but now they know each other better ie each 
knows the other is reliable and this may be useful if they should meet socially 
the inverse case is also worth considering mr e and mr f have set up a twostroke ritual hihi 
one day instead of passing on mr e stops and asks how are you the conversation proceeds as 
follows 

ie hi 
 if hi 
2e how are you  
2f puzzled fine how are you  
3e everythings great warm enough for you  
3f yeah cautiously looks like rain though  
4e nice to see you again 

15

 
 
 
 
 
4f same here sorry i have got to get to the library before it closes so long  
5e so long 

as mr f hurries away he thinks to himself what is come over him all of a sudden is he selling 
insurance or something in transactional terms this reads all he owes me is one stroke why is he 
giving me five 
an even simpler demonstration of the truly transactional businesslike nature of these simple rituals 
is the occasion when mr g says hi and mr h passes on without replying mr gs reaction is 
what is the matter with him meaning i gave him a stroke and he did not give me one in return 
if mr h keeps this up and extends it to other acquaintances he is going to cause some talk in his 
community 
in borderline cases it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a procedure and a ritual the 
tendency is for the layman to call professional procedures rituals while actually every transaction 
may be based on sound even vital experience but the layman does not have the background to 
appreciate that conversely there is a tendency for professionals to rationalize ritualistic elements 
that still cling to their procedures and to dismiss skeptical laymen on the ground that they are not 
equipped to understand and one of the ways in which entrenched professionals may resist the 
introduction of sound new procedures is by laughing them off as rituals hence the fate of 
semmelweis and other innovators 
the essential and similar feature of both procedures and rituals is that they are stereotyped once 
the first transaction has been initiated the whole series is predictable and follows a predetermined 
course to a foreordained conclusion unless special conditions arise the difference between them 
lies in the origin of the predetermination procedures are programmed by the adult and rituals are 
parentally patterned 
individuals who are not comfortable or adept with rituals sometimes evade them by substituting 
procedures they can be found for example among people who like to help the hostess with 
preparing or serving food and drink at parties 

chapter four 
pastimes 
pastimes occur in social and temporal matrices of varying degrees of complexity and hence 
vary in complexity however if we use the transaction as the unit of social intercourse we can 
dissect out of appropriate situations an entity which may be called a simple pastime this may be 
defined as a series of semiritualistic simple complementary transactions arranged around a single 
field of material whose primary object is to structure an interval of time the beginning and end of 
the interval are typically signaled by procedures or rituals the transactions are adaptively 
programmed so that each party will obtain the maximum gains or advantages during the interval 
the better his adaptation the more he will get out of it 
pastimes are typically played at parties social gatherings or during the waiting period before a 
formal group meeting begins such waiting periods before a meeting begins have the same 
structure and dynamics as parries pastimes may take the form described as chitchat or they 
may become more serious eg argumentative a large cocktail party often functions as a kind of 
gallery for the exhibition of pastimes in one corner of the room a few people are playing pta 
another corner is the forum for psychiatry a third is the theater for ever been or what 
became the fourth is engaged for general motors and the buffet is reserved for women who 
want to play kitchen or wardrobe the proceedings at such a gathering may be almost identical 
with a change of names here and there with the proceedings at a dozen similar parties taking place 
simultaneously in the area at another dozen in a different social stratum a different assortment of 
pastimes is underway 
pastimes may be classified in different ways the external determinants are sociological sex age 
marital status cultural racial or economic general motors comparing cars and who won 

16

 
 
 
sports are both man talk grocery kitchen and wardrobe are all lady talk or as 
practiced in the south seas mary talk making out is adolescent while the onset of middle 
age is marked by a shift to balance sheet other species of this class which are all variations of 
small talk are how to go about doing something an easy filler for short airplane trips 
how much does it cost a favorite in lowermiddleclass bars ever been to some nostalgic 
place a middleclass game for old hands such as salesmen do you know soandso for 
lonely ones what became of good old joe often played by economic successes and failures 
morning after what a hangover and martini i know a better way typical of a certain kind of 
ambitious young person 
the structuraltransactional classification is a more personal one thus pta may be played at 
three levels at the childchild level it takes the form of how do you deal with recalcitrant 
parents its adultadult form pta proper is popular among wellread young mothers with 
older people it tends to take the dogmatic parentparent form of juvenile delinquency some 
married couples play tell them dear in which the wife is parental and the husband comes 
through like a precocious child look ma no hands is similarly a childparent pastime suitable 
for people of any age sometimes diffidently adapted into aw shucks fellows 
even more cogent is the psychological classification of pastimes both pta and psychiatry for 
example may be played in either projective or introjective forms the analysis of pta  
projective type is represented in figure 6a based on the following parentparent paradigm 
a there would not be all this delinquency if it were not for broken homes 
b its not only that even in good homes nowadays the children are not taught manners the way 
they used to be 
pta introjective type runs along the following lines adultadult 
c i just do not seem to have what it takes to be a mother 
d no matter how hard you try they never grow up the way you want them to so you have to keep 
wondering if you are doing the right thing and what mistakes you have made 
psychiatry projective type takes the adultadult form 
e i think its some unconscious oral frustration that makes him act that way 
f you seem to have your aggressions so well sublimated 
figure 6b represents psychiatry introjective type another adultadult pastime 
g that painting symbolizes smearing to me 
h in my case painting is trying to please my father 
besides structuring time and providing mutually acceptable stroking for the parties concerned 
pastimes serve the additional function of being socialselection processes while a pastime is in 
progress the child in each player is watchfully assessing the potentialities of the others involved 
at the end of the party each person will have selected certain players he would like to see more of 
while others he will discard regardless of how skillfully or pleasantly they each engaged in the 
pastime the ones he selects are those who seem the most likely candidates for more complex 
relationshipsthat is games this sorting system however well rationalized is actually largely 
unconscious and intuitive

in special cases the adult overrides the child in the selection process this is most clearly 
illustrated by an insurance salesman who carefully learns to play social pastimes while he is 
playing his adult listens for possible prospects and selects them from the players as people he 
would like to see more of their adeptness at games or congeniality is quite irrelevant to his process 
of selection which is based as in most cases on peripheral factorsin this instance financial 
readiness 
pastimes however have a quite specific aspect of exclusiveness for example man talk and 
lady talk do not mix people playing a hard hand of ever been there will be annoyed by an 
intruder who wants to play how much for avocados or morning after people playing 
projective pta will resent the intrusion of introjective pta although usually not as intensely 
as the other way around 
pastimes form the basis for the selection of acquaintances and may lead to friendship a party of 
women who drop in at each others houses every morning for coffee to play delinquent husband 
are likely to give a cool reception to a new neighbor who wants to play sunny side up if they 
are saying how mean their husbands are it is too disconcerting to have a newcomer declare that her 
husband is just marvelous in fact perfect and they will not keep her long so at a cocktail party if 
someone wants to move from one corner to another he must either join in the pastime played in his 
new location or else successfully switch the whole proceeding into a new channel a good hostess 
of course takes the situation in hand immediately and states the program we were just playing 
projective pta what do you think or come now you girls have been playing wardrobe long 
enough mr j here is a writerpoliticiansurgeon and i am sure he would like to play look ma no 
hands would not you mr f 
another important advantage obtained from pastimes is the confirmation of role and the stabilizing 
of position a role is something like what jung calls persona except that it is less opportunistic and 
more deeply rooted in the individuals fantasies thus in projective pta one player may take the 
role of tough parent another the role of righteous parent a third the role of indulgent parent and a 
fourth the role of helpful parent all four experience and exhibit a parental ego state but each 
presents himself differently the role of each one is confirmed if it prevails that is if it meets 
with no antagonism or is strengthened by any antagonism it meets or is approved by certain types 
of people with stroking 
the confirmation of his role stabilizes the individuals position and this is called the existential 
advantage from the pastime a position is a simple predicative statement which influences all of the 
individuals transactions in the long run it determines his destiny and often that of his descendants 

18

 
 
 
 
as well a position may be more or less absolute typical positions from which projective pta 
can be played are all children are bad all other children are bad all children are sad all 
children are persecuted these positions might give rise to the role of die tough the righteous the 
indulgent and the helpful parent respectively actually a position is primarily manifested by the 
mental attitude to which it gives rise and it is with this attitude that the individual undertakes the 
transactions which constitute his role 
positions are taken and become fixed surprisingly early from the second or even the first year to 
the seventh year of lifein any case long before the individual is competent or experienced enough 
to make such a serious commitment it is not difficult to deduce from an individuals position the 
kind of childhood he must have had unless something or somebody intervenes he spends the rest 
of his life stabilizing his position and dealing with situations that threaten it by avoiding them 
warding other certain elements or manipulating them provocatively so that they are transformed 
from threats into justifications one reason pastimes are so stereotyped is that they serve such 
stereotyped purposes but the gains they offer show why people play them so eagerly and why 
they can be so pleasant if played with people who have constructive or benevolent positions to 
maintain 
a pastime is not always easy to distinguish from an activity and combinations frequently occur 
many commonplace pastimes such as general motors consist of what psychologists might call 
multiplechoicesentencecompletion exchanges 
a i like a fordchevroletplymouth better than a fordchevroletplymouth because    
b oh well id rather have a fordchevroletplymouth than a fordchevroletplymouth 
because    
it is apparent that there may actually be some useful information conveyed in such stereotypes 
a few other common pastimes may be mentioned me too is often a variant of are not it awful 
why do not they do something about it is a favorite among housewives who do not wish to be 
emancipated then well is a childchild pastime let us find something to do is played by 
juvenile delinquents or mischievous grownups 

chapter five 
games 

1 definition 
a game is an ongoing series of complementary ulterior transactions progressing to a welldefined 
predictable outcome descriptively it is a recurring set of transactions often repetitious 
superficially plausible with a concealed motivation or more colloquially a series of moves with a 
snare or gimmick games are clearly differentiated from procedures rituals and pastimes by two 
chief characteristics i their ulterior quality and 2 the payoff procedures may be successful 
rituals effective and pastimes profitable but all of them are by definition candid they may involve 
contest but not conflict and the ending may be sensational but it is not dramatic every game on 
the other hand is basically dishonest and the outcome has a dramatic as distinct from merely 
exciting quality 
it remains to distinguish games from the one remaining type of social action which so far has not 
been discussed an operation is a simple transaction or set of transactions undertaken for a specific 
stated purpose if someone frankly asks for reassurance and gets it that is an operation if someone 
asks for reassurance and after it is given turns it in some way to the disadvantage of the giver that 
is a game superficially then a game looks like a set of operations but after the payoff it becomes 
apparent that these operations were really maneuvers not honest requests but moves in the game 
in the insurance game for example no matter what the agent appears to be doing in conversation 
if he is a hard player he is really looking for or working on a prospect what he is after if he is 
worth his salt is to make a killing the same applies to the real estate game the panama 
game and similar occupations hence at a social gathering while a salesman is engaged in 
pastimes particularly variants of balance sheet his congenial participation may conceal a series 

19

 
of skillful maneuvers designed to elicit the kind of information he is professionally interested in 
there are dozens of trade journals devoted to improving commercial maneuvers and which give 
accounts of outstanding players and games interesting operators who make unusually big deals 
transactionally speaking these are merely variants of sports illustrated chess world and other 
sports magazines 
as far as angular transactions are concernedgames which are consciously planned with 
professional precision under adult control to yield the maximum gainsthe big con games 
which flourished in the early 1900s are hard to surpass for detailed practical planning and 
psychological virtuosity 
what we are concerned with here however are the unconscious games played by innocent people 
engaged in duplex transactions of which they are not fully aware and which form the most 
important aspect of social life all over the world because of their dynamic qualities games are 
easy to distinguish from mere static attitudes which arise from taking a position 
the use of the word game should not be misleading as explained in the introduction it does not 
necessarily imply fun or even enjoyment many salesmen do not consider their work fun as arthur 
miller made clear in his play the death of a salesman and there may be no lack of seriousness 
football games nowadays are taken very seriously but no more so than such transactional games as 
alcoholic or thirddegree rapo 
the same applies to the word play as anyone who has played hard poker or played the stock 
market over a long period can testify the possible seriousness of games and play and the possibly 
serious results are well known to anthropologists the most complex game that ever existed that 
of courtier as described so well by stendhal in the charterhouse of parma was deadly serious 
the grimmest of all of course is war 

2 a typical game 
the most common game played between spouses is colloquially called if it were not for you and 
this will be used to illustrate the characteristics of games in general 
mrs white complained that her husband severely restricted her social activities so that she had 
never learned to dance due to changes in her attitude brought about by psychiatric treatment her 
husband became less sure of himself and more indulgent mrs white was then free to enlarge the 
scope of her activities she signed up for dancing classes and then discovered to her despair that 
she had a morbid fear of dance floors and had to abandon this project 
this unfortunate adventure along with similar ones laid bare some important aspects of the 
structure of her marriage out of her many suitors she had picked a domineering man for a husband 
she was then in a position to complain that she could do all sorts of things if it were not for you 
many of her women friends also had domineering husbands and when they met for their morning 
coffee they spent a good deal of time playing if it were not for him 
as it turned out however contrary to her complaints her husband was performing a very real 
service for her by forbidding her to do something she was deeply afraid of and by preventing her 
in fact from even becoming aware of her fears this was one reason her child had shrewdly 
chosen such a husband 
but there was more to it than that his prohibitions and her complaints frequently led to quarrels so 
that their sex life was seriously impaired and because of his feelings of guilt he frequently 
brought her gifts which might not otherwise have been forthcoming certainly when he gave her 
more freedom his gifts diminished in lavishness and frequency she and her husband had little in 
common besides their household worries and the children so that their quarrels stood out as 
important events it was mainly on these occasions that they had anything but the most casual 
conversations at any rate her married life had proved one thing to her that she had always 
maintained that ail men were mean and tyrannical as it turned out this attitude was related to 
some daydreams of being sexually abused which had plagued her in earlier years 
there are various ways of describing this game in general terms it is apparent that it belongs in the 
large field of social dynamics the basic fact is that by marrying mr and mrs white have an 

20

 
opportunity to communicate with each other and such an opportunity may be called social contact 
the fact that they use this opportunity makes their household a social aggregation as contrasted 
with a new york subway train for example where people are in spatial contact but rarely avail 
themselves of the opportunity and so form a thissocial aggregation the influence the whites exert 
on each others behavior and responses constitutes social action various disciplines would 
investigate such social action from different points of view since we are here concerned with the 
personal histories and psychodynamics of the individuals involved the present approach is one 
aspect of social psychiatry some implicit or explicit judgment is passed on the healthiness of the 
games studied this is somewhat different from the more neutral and less committed attitudes of 
sociology and social psychology psychiatry reserves the right to say just a moment which the 
other disciplines do not transactional analysis is a branch of social psychiatry and game analysis 
is a special aspect of transactional analysis 
practical game analysis deals with special cases as they appear in specific situations theoretical 
game analysis attempts to abstract and generalize the characteristics of various games so that they 
can be recognized independently of their momentary verbal content and their cultural matrix the 
theoretical analysis of if it were not for you marital type for example should state the 
characteristics of that game in such a way that it can be recognized just as easily in a new guinea 
jungle village as in a manhattan penthouse whether it is concerned with a nuptial party or with the 
financial problems of getting a fishing rod for the grandchildren and regardless of how bluntly or 
subtly the moves are made according to the permissible degrees of frankness between husband and 
wife the prevalence of the game in a given society is a matter for sociology and anthropology 
game analysis as a part of social psychiatry is only interested in describing the game when it does 
occur regardless of how often that may be this distinction is not complex but it is analogous to 
the distinction between public health and internal medicine the first is interested in the prevalence 
of malaria while the latter studies cases of malaria as they come up in the jungle or in manhattan 
at the present time the scheme given below has been round the most useful one for theoretical 
game analysis no doubt it will be improved as further knowledge accumulates the first requisite 
is to recognize that a certain sequence of maneuvers meets the criteria of a game as many samples 
as possible of the game are then collected the significant features of the collection are isolated 
certain aspects emerge as essential these are then classified under headings which are designed to 
be as meaningful and instructive as possible in the current state of knowledge the analysis is 
undertaken from the point of view of the one who is itin this case mrs white 
thesis this is a genera description of the game including the immediate sequence of events the 
social level and information about their psychological background evolution and significance the 
psychological level in the case of if it were not for you marital type the details already given 
will serve pp 5051 for the sake of brevity this game will henceforth be referred to as iwfy 
antithesis the presumption that a certain sequence constitutes a game is tentative until it has been 
existentially validated this validation is carried out by a refusal to play or by undercutting the 
payoff the one who is it will then make more intense efforts to continue the game in the face of 
adamant refusal to play or a successful undercutting he will then lapse into a state called despair 
which in some respects resembles a depression but is different in significant ways it is more acute 
and contains elements of frustration and bewilderment it may be manifested for example by the 
onset of perplexed weeping in a successful therapeutic situation this may soon be replaced by 
humorous laughter implying an adult realization there i go again thus despair is a concern of 
the adult while in depression it is the child who has the executive power hopefulness 
enthusiasm or a lively interest in ones surroundings is the opposite of depression laughter is the 
opposite of despair hence the enjoyable quality of therapeutic game analysis the antithesis to 
iwfy is permissiveness as long as the husband is prohibitive the game can proceed if instead of 
saying do not you dare he says go ahead the underlying phobias are unmasked and the wife 
can no longer turn on him as demonstrated in mrs whites case 
for clear understanding of a game the antithesis should be known and its effectiveness 
demonstrated in practice

aim this states simply the general purpose of the game sometimes there are alternatives the aim 
of iwfy may be stated as either reassurance its not that i am afraid its that he will not let me or 
vindication its not that i am not trying its that he holds me back the reassuring function is 
easier to clarify and is more in accord with the security needs of the wife therefore iwfy is most 
simply regarded as having the aim of reassurance 
roles as previously noted ego states are not roles but phenomena therefore ego states and roles 
have to be distinguished in a formal description games may be described as twohanded three
handed manyhanded etc according to the number of roles offered sometimes the ego state of 
each player corresponds to his role sometimes it does not 
iwfy is a twohanded game and calls for a restricted wife and a domineering husband the wife 
may play her role either as a prudent adult its best that i do as he says or as a petulant child 
the domineering husband may preserve an adult ego state its best that you do as i say or slip 
into a parental one you would better do what i say 
dynamics there are alternatives in staring the psychodynamic driving forces behind each case of 
a game it is usually possible however to pick out a single psychodynamic concept which usefully 
aptly and meaningfully epitomizes the situation thus iwfy is best described as deriving from 
phobic sources 
examples since the childhood origins of a game or its infantile prototypes are instructive to 
study it is worthwhile to search for such cognates in making a formal description it happens that 
ifwy is just as frequently played by little children as by grownups so the childhood version is the 
same as the later one with the actual parent substituted for the restricting husband 
transactional paradigm the transactional analysis of a typical situation is presented giving both 
the social and psychological levels of a revealing ulterior transaction in its most dramatic form 
iwfy at the social level is a parentchild game 
mr white you stay home and take care of the house 
mrs white if it were not for you i could be out having fun 
at the psychological level the ulterior marriage contract the relationship is childchild and quite 
different 
mr white you must always be here when i get home i am terrified of desertion 
mrs white i will be if you help me avoid phobic situations 
the two levels are illustrated in figure 7

moves the moves of a game correspond roughly to the strokes in a ritual as in any game the 
players become increasingly adept with practice wasteful moves are eliminated and more and 
more purpose is condensed into each move beautiful friendships are often based on the fact that 
the players complement each other with great economy and satisfaction so that there is a maximum 
yield with a minimum effort from the games they play with each other certain intermediate 
precautionary or concessional moves can be eluded giving a high degree of elegance to the 
relationship the effort saved on defensive maneuvers can be devoted to ornamental flourishes 
instead to the delight of both parries and sometimes of the onlookers as well the student observes 
that there is a minimum number of moves essential to the program of the game and these can be 
stated in the protocol individual players will embellish or multiply these basic moves according to 
their needs talents or desires the framework for iwfy is as follows 
1 instructioncompliance you stay homeall right 
2 instructionprotest you stay home againif it were not for you 
advantages the general advantages of a game consist in its stabilizing homeostatic functions 
biological homeostasis is promoted by the stroking and psychological stability is reinforced by 
the confirmation of position as has already been noted stroking may take various forms so that 
the biological advantage of a game may be stated in tactile terms thus the husbands role in iwfy 
is reminiscent of a backhanded slap quite different in effect from a palmar slap which is a direct 
humiliation and the wifes response is something like a petulant kick in the shins hence the 
biological gain from iwfy is derived from the belligerencepetulance exchanges a distressing but 
apparently effective way to maintain the health of nervous tissues 
confirmation of the wifes positionall men are tyrants is the existential advantage this 
position is a reaction to the need to surrender that is inherent in the phobias a demonstration of the 
coherent structure which underlies all games the expanded statement would be if i went out 
alone in a crowd i would be overcome by the temptation to surrender at home i do not surrender he 
forces me which proves that all men are tyrants hence this game is commonly played by women 
who suffer from feelings of unreality which signifies their difficulty in keeping the adult in charge 
in situations of strong temptation the detailed elucidation of these mechanisms belongs to 
psychoanalysis rather than game analysis in game analysis the end product is the chief concern 
internal psychological advantage of a game is its direct effect on the psychic economy libido in 
iwfy the socially acceptable surrender to the husbands authority keeps the woman from 
experiencing neurotic fears at the same time it satisfies masochistic needs if they exist using 
masochism not in the sense of selfabnegation but with its classical meaning of sexual excitement 
in situations of deprivation humiliation or pain that is it excites her to be deprived and dominated 
external psychological advantage is the avoidance of the feared situation by playing the game this 
is especially obvious in iwfy where it is the outstanding motivation by complying with the 
husbands strictures the wife avoids the public situations which she fears 
internal social advantage is designed by the name of the game as it is played in the individuals 
intimate circle by her compliance the wife gains the privilege of saying if it were not for you 
this helps to structure the time she must spend with her husband in the case of mrs white this 
need for structure was especially strong because of the lack of other common interests especially 
before the arrival of their offspring and after the children were grown in between the game was 
played less intensively and less frequently because the children performed their usual function of 
structuring time for their parents and also provided an even more widely accepted version of 
iwfy the busyhousewife variation the fact that young mothers in america often really are very 
busy does not change the analysis of this variation game analysis only attempts to answer this 
question without prejudice given that a young woman is busy how does she go about exploiting 
her busyness in order to get some compensation for it 
external social advantage is designated by the use made of the situation in outside social contacts 
in the case of the game if it were not for you which is what the wife says to her husband there is 
a transformation into the pastime if it were not for him when she meets with her friends over 
morning coffee again the influence of games in the selection of social companions is shown the 

23

 
new neighbor who is invited for morning coffee is being invited to play if it were not for him if 
she plays well and good she will soon be a bosom friend of the oldtimers other things being 
equal if she refuses to play and insists on taking a charitable view of her husband she will not last 
long her situation will be the same as if she kept refusing to drink at cocktail partiesin most 
circles she would gradually be dropped from the guest lists 
this completes the analysis of the formal features of iwfy in order to clarify the procedure 
further the analysis of why do not youyes but which is the most common game played at 
social gatherings committee meetings and psychotherapy groups the world over should be 
consulted page 115 

3 the genesis of games 
from the present point of view child rearing may be regarded as an educational process in which 
the child is taught what games to play and how to play diem he is also taught procedures rituals 
and pastimes appropriate to his position in the local social situation but these are less significant 
his knowledge of and skill in procedures rituals and pastimes determine what opportunities will be 
available to him other things being equal but his games determine the use he will make of those 
opportunities and the outcomes of situations for which he is eligible as elements of his script or 
unconscious lifeplan his favored games also determine his ultimate destiny again with other 
things being equal the payoffs on his marriage and career and the circumstances surrounding his 
death 
while conscientious parents devote a great deal of attention to teaching their children procedures 
rituals and pastimes appropriate to their stations in life and with equal care select schools colleges 
and churches where their teachings will be reinforced they tend to overlook the question of games 
which form the basic structure for the emotional dynamics of each family and which the children 
learn through significant experiences in everyday living from their earliest months related 
questions have been discussed for thousands of years in a rather general unsystematic fashion and 
there has been some attempt at a more methodical approach in the modern orthopsychiatric 
literature but without the concept of games there is little possibility of a consistent investigation 
theories of internal individual psychodynamics have so far not been able to solve satisfactorily the 
problems of human relationships these are transactional situations which call for a theory of social 
dynamics that cannot be derived solely from consideration of individual motivations 
since there are as yet few welltrained specialists in child psychology and child psychiatry who are 
also trained in game analysis observations on the genesis of games are sparse fortunately the 
following episode took place in the presence of a welleducated transactional analyst 
tanjy age 7 got a stomachache at the dinner table and asked to be excused for that reason his 
parents suggested that he lie down for a while his little brother mike age 3 then said i have a 
stomachache too evidently angling for the same consideration the father looked at him for a few 
seconds and then replied you do not want to play that game do you whereupon mike burst out 
laughing and said no 
if this had been a household of food or bowel faddists mike would also have been packed off to 
bed by his alarmed parents if he and they had repeated this performance several times it might be 
anticipated that this game would have become part of mikes character as it so often does if the 
parents cooperate whenever he was jealous of a privilege granted to a competitor he would plead 
illness in order to get some privileges himself the ulterior transaction would then consist of 
social level i do not feel well  psychological level you must grant me a privilege too mike 
however was saver from such a hypochondriacal career perhaps he will end up with a worse fate 
but that is not the issue the issue is that a game in statu nascendi was broken right there by the 
fathers question and by the boys frank acknowledgment that what he proposed was a game 
this demonstrates clearly enough that games are quite deliberately initiated by young children 
after they become fixed patterns of stimulus and response their origins become lost in the mists of 
time and their ulterior nature becomes obscured by social fogs both can be brought into awareness 
only by appropriate procedures the origin by some form of analytic therapy and the ulterior aspect 

24

 
by antithesis repeated clinical experience along these lines makes it clear that games are imitative 
in nature and that they are initially set up by the adult neopsychic aspect of the childs 
personality if the child ego state can be revived in the grownup player the psychological aptitude 
of this segment the adult aspect of the child ego state is so striking and its skill in manipulating 
people so enviable that it is colloquially called the professor of psychiatry hence in 
psychotherapy groups which concentrate on game analysis one of the more sophisticated 
procedures is the search for the little professor in each patient whose early adventures in setting 
up games between the ages of two and eight are listened to by everyone present with fascination 
and often unless the games are tragic with enjoyment and even hilarity in which the patient 
himself may join with justifiable selfappreciation and smugness once he is able to do that he is 
well on his way to relinquishing what may be an unfortunate behavior pattern which he is much 
better off without 
those are the reasons why in the formal description of a game an attempt is always made to 
describe the infantile or childhood prototype 

4 the function of games 
because there is so little opportunity for intimacy in daily life and because some forms of intimacy 
especially if intense are psychologically impossible for most people the bulk of the time in 
serious social life is taken up with playing games hence games are both necessary and desirable 
and the only problem at issue is whether the games played by an individual offer the best yield for 
him in this connection it should be remembered that the essential feature of a game is its 
culmination or payoff the principal function of the preliminary moves is to set up the situation for 
this payoff but they are always designed to harvest the maximum permissible satisfaction at each 
step as a secondary product thus in schlemiel making messes and then apologizing the payoff 
and the purpose of the game is to obtain the forgiveness which is forced by the apology the 
spillings and cigarette burns are only steps leading up to this but each such trespass yields its own 
pleasure the enjoyment derived from the spilling does not make spilling a game the apology is 
the critical stimulus that leads to the denouement otherwise the spilling would simply be a 
destructive procedure a delinquency perhaps enjoyable 
the game of alcoholic is similar whatever the physiological origin if any of the need to drink 
in terms of game analysis the imbibing is merely a move in a game which is carried on with the 
people in the environment the drinking may bring its own kinds of pleasure but it is not the 
essence of the game this is demonstrated in the variant of dry alcoholic which involves the 
same moves and leads to the same payoff as the regular game but is played without any bottles 
beyond their social function in structuring time satisfactorily some games are urgently necessary 
for the maintenance of health in certain individuals these peoples psychic stability is so 
precarious and their positions are so tenuously maintained that to deprive them of their games may 
plunge them into irreversible despair and even psychosis such people will fight very hard against 
any antithetical moves this is often observed in marital situations when the psychiatric 
improvement of one spouse ie the abandonment of destructive games leads to rapid 
deterioration in the other spouse to whom the games were of paramount importance in maintaining 
equilibrium hence it is necessary to exercise prudence in game analysis 
fortunately the rewards of gamefree intimacy which is or should be the most perfect form of 
human living are so great that even precariously balanced personalities can safely and joyfully 
relinquish their games if an appropriate partner can be found for the better relationship 
on a larger scale games are integral and dynamic components of the unconscious lifeplan or 
script of each individual they serve to fill in the time while he waits for the final fulfillment 
simultaneously advancing the action since the last act of a script characteristically calls for either a 
miracle or a catastrophe depending on whether the script is constructive or destructive the 
corresponding games ate accordingly either constructive or destructive in colloquial terms an 
individual whose script is oriented toward waiting for santa claus is likely to be pleasant to deal 
with in such games as gee you are wonderful mr murgatroyd while someone with a tragic 

25

 
script oriented toward waiting for rigor mortis to set in may play such disagreeable games as 
now i have got you you son of a bitch 
it should be noted that colloquialisms such as those in the previous sentence are an integral part of 
game analysis and are freely used in transactional psychotherapy groups and seminars the 
expression waiting for rigor mortis to set in originated in a dream of a patient in which she 
decided to get certain things done before rigor mortis set in a patient in a sophisticated group 
pointed out what the therapist had overlooked that in practice waiting for santa claus and waiting 
for death are synonymous since colloquialisms are of decisive importance in game analysis they 
will be discussed at length later on 

5 the classification of games  
most of the variables used in analyzing games and pastimes have already been mentioned and any 
of them can be used in classifying games and pastimes systematically some of the more obvious 
classifications are based on the following factors 
1 number of players twohanded games frigid woman threehanded games let us you and 
him fight fivehanded games alcoholic and manyhanded games why do not youyes but 
2 currency used words psychiatry money debtor parts of the body polysurgery 
3 clinical types hysterical rapo obsessivecompulsive schlemiel paranoid why does this 
have to happen to me depressive there i go again 
4 zonal oral alcoholic anal schlemiel phallic let us you and him fight 
5 psychodynamic counterphobic if it were not for you projective pta introjective 
psychiatry 
6 instinctual masochistic if it were not for you sadistic schlemiel fetishistic frigid man 
in addition to the number of players three other quantitative variables are often useful to consider 
1 flexibility some games such as debtor and polysurgery can be played properly with only one 
kind of currency while others such as exhibitionistic games are more flexible 
2 tenacity some people give up their games easily others are persistent 
3 intensity some people play their games in a relaxed way others are more tense and aggressive 
games so played are known as easy and hard games respectively 
these three variables converge to make games gentle or violent in mentally disturbed people there 
is often a noticeable progression in this respect so that one can speak of stages a paranoid 
schizophrenic may initially play a flexible loose easy game of firststage are not it awful and 
progress to an inflexible tenacious hard third stage the stages in a game are distinguished as 
follows 
a a firstdegree game is one which is socially acceptable in the agents circle 
b a seconddegree game is one from which no permanent irremediable damage arises but which 
the players would rather conceal from the public 
c a thirddegree game is one which is played for keeps and which ends in the surgery the 
courtroom or the morgue 
games can also be classified according to any of the other specific factors discussed in the analysis 
of iwfy the aims the roles the most obvious advantages the most likely candidate for a 
systematic scientific classification is probably one based on the existential position but since 
knowledge of this factor is not yet sufficiently advanced such a classification will have to be 
postponed failing that the most practical classification at present is probably a sociological one 
that is what will be used in the next section 

notes 
due credit should be given to stephen potter for his perceptive humorous discussions of 
maneuvers or ploys in everyday social situations and to g h mead for his pioneering study of 
the role of games in social living3 those games that lead to psychiatric disabilities have been 
systematically studied at the san francisco social psychiatry seminars since 1958 and this sector

part ii 
a thesaurus of games 

introduction 
this collection is complete to date 1962 but new games are continually being discovered 
sometimes what appears to be another example of a known game turns out on more careful study 
to be an entirely new one and a game which appears to be new often turns out to be a variation of a 
known one the individual items of the analyses are also subject to change as new knowledge 
accumulates for example where there are several possible choices in describing dynamics the 
statement given may turn out later not to have been the most cogent one both the list of games and 
the items given in the analyses however are adequate for clinical work 
some of the games are discussed and analyzed in extenso others which require more investigation 
or are uncommon or whose significance is fairly obvious are only briefly mentioned the one who 
is it is generally referred to as the agent or is given the name of white while the other party 
is called black 
the games are classified into families according to the situations in which they most commonly 
occur life games marital games party games sexual games and underworld games then 
comes a section for professionals on consulting room games and finally some examples of good 
games 

1 notation 
the following notation will be used in the analytic protocols 
title if the game has a long name a convenient abbreviation is used in the text where a game or 
its variations has more than one name a cross reference will be found in the index of games in 
oral reports it is preferable to use the full name of the game rather than its abbreviation or acronym 
thesis this is restated as cogently as possible 
aim this gives the most meaningful choice based on die writers experience 
roles the role of the one who is it and from whose point of view the game is discussed is given 
first in italics 
dynamics as with aim 
examples 1 this gives an illustration of the game as played in childhood the most easily 
recognizable pertinent prototype 2 an illustration from adult life 
paradigm this illustrates as briefly as possible the critical transaction or transactions at the social 
and psychological levels 
moves this gives the minimum number of transactional stimuli and transactional responses as 
found in practice these may be expanded diluted or ornamented to an unlimited extent in different 
situations 
advantages 1 internal psychologicalthis attempts to state how the game contributes to internal 
psychic stability 2 external psychologicalthis attempts to state what anxietyarousing 
situations or intimacies are being avoided 3 internal socialthis gives the characteristic phrase 
used in the game as played with intimates 4 external socialthis gives the key phrase used in 
the derivative game or pastime played in less intimate circles 
5 biologicalthis attempts to characterize the kind of stroking which the game offers to the 
parties involved 
6 existentialthis states the position from which the game is typically played 
relatives this gives the names of complementary allied and antithetical games 
an adequate understanding of a game can only be obtained in the psychotherapeutic situation 
people who play destructive games will come to the therapist far more frequently than people who 
play constructive ones therefore most of the games which are well understood are basically 

28

 
destructive but the reader should remember that there are constructive ones played by more 
fortunate people 
and to prevent the idea of games from becoming vulgarized as so many psychiatric terms are it 
should be emphasized once more that it is a very precise idea games should be clearly 
distinguished by the criteria given previously from procedures rituals pastimes operations 
maneuvers and the attitudes which arise from various positions a game is played from a position 
but a position or its corresponding attitude is not a game 

2 colloquialisms 
many colloquialisms used here were supplied by patients all of them if used with due regard to 
timing and sensibilities are appreciated understood and enjoyed by the players if some of them 
seem disrespectful the irony is directed against the games and not against the people who play 
them the first requirement for colloquialisms is aptness and if they often sound amusing that is 
precisely because they hit the nail on the head as i have tried to show elsewhere in discussing 
colloquial epithets a whole page of learned polysyllables may not convey as much as the statement 
that a certain woman is a bitch or that a certain man is a jerk1 psychological truths may be stated 
for academic purposes in scientific language but the effective recognition of emotional strivings in 
practice may require a different approach so we prefer playing are not it awful to verbalizing 
projected anal aggression the former not only has a more dynamic meaning and impact but it is 
actually more precise and sometimes people get better faster in bright rooms than diey do in drab 
ones

chapter six 
life games 
all games have an important and probably decisive influence on the destinies of the players under 
ordinary social conditions but some offer more opportunities than others for lifelong careers and 
are more likely to involve relatively innocent bystanders this group may be conveniently called 
life games it includes alcoholic debtor kick me now i have got you you son of a 
bitch see what you made me do and their principal variants they merge on the one side with 
marital games and on the other with those of the underworld 

1 alcoholic 
thesis in game analysis there is no such thing as alcoholism or an alcoholic but there is a role 
called the alcoholic in a certain type of game if a biochemical or physiological abnormality is the 
prim mover in excessive drinkingand that is still open to some question  then its study belongs in 
the field of internal medicine game analysis is interested in something quite differentthe kinds 
of social transactions that are related to such excesses hence the game alcoholic 
in its full flower this is a fivehanded game although the roles may be condensed so that it starts 
off and terminates as a twohanded one the central role is that of the alcoholicthe one who is 
itplayed by white the chief supporting role is that of persecutor typically played by a 
member of the opposite sex usually the spouse the third role is that of rescuer usually played by 
someone of the same sex often the good family doctor who is interested in the patient and also in 
drinking problems in the classical situation the doctor successfully rescues the alcoholic from his 
habit after white has not taken a drink for six months they congratulate each other the following 
day white is found in the gutter 
the fourth role is that of the patsy or dummy in literature this is played by the delicatessen man 
who extends credit to white gives him a sandwich on the curt and perhaps a cup of coffee without 
either persecuting him or trying to rescue him in life this is more frequently played by whites 
mother who gives him money and often sympathizes with him about the wife who does not 
understand him in this aspect of the game white is required to account in some plausible way for 
his need for moneyby some project in which both pretend to believe although they know what 
he is really going to spend most of the money for sometimes the patsy slides over into another role 
which is a helpful but not essential one the agitator the good guy who offers supplies without 
even being asked for them come have a drink with me and you will go downhill faster 
the ancillary professional in all drinking games is the bartender or liquor clerk in the game 
alcoholic he plays the fifth role the connection the direct source of supply who also 
understands alcoholic talk and who in a way is the most meaningful person in the life of any addict 
the difference between the connection and the other players is the difference between 
professionals and amateurs in any game the professional knows when to stop at a certain point a 
good bartender refuses to serve the alcoholic who is then left without any supplies unless he can 
locate a more indulgent connection 
in the initial stages of alcoholic the wife may play all three supporting roles at midnight the 
patsy undressing him making him coffee and letting him beat up on her in the morning the 
persecutor berating him for the evil of his ways and in the evening the rescuer pleading with him 
to change them in the later stages due sometimes to organic deterioration the persecutor and the 
rescuer can be dispensed with but are tolerated if they are also wilting to act as sources of supply 
white will go to the mission house and be rescued if he can get a free meal there or be will stand 
for a scolding amateur or professional as long as he can get a handout afterward 
present experience indicates that the payoff in alcoholic as is characteristic of games in general 
comes from the aspect to which most investigators pay least attention in the analysis of this game 
drinking itself is merely an incidental pleasure having added advantages the procedure leading up 
to the culmination which is the hangover it is the same in the game of schlemiel the messmaking 

30

 
which attracts the most attention is merely a pleasuregiving way for white to lead up to the crux 
which is obtaining forgiveness from black 
for the alcoholic the hangover is not as much the physical pain as the psychological torment the 
two favorite pastimes of drinking people are martini how many drinks and how they were mixed 
and morning after let me tell you about my hangover martini is played for the most part 
by social drinkers many alcoholics prefer a hard round of psychological morning after and 
organizations such as aa offer him an unlimited opportunity for this 
whenever one patient visited his psychiatrist after a binge he would call himself all sorts of names 
the psychiatrist said nothing later recounting these visits in a therapy group white said with 
smug satisfaction that it was the psychiatrist who had called him all those names the main 
conversational interest of many alcoholics in the therapeutic situation is not their drinking which 
they apparently mention mostly in deference to their persecutors but their subsequent suffering 
the transactions object of the drinking aside from the personal pleasures it brings is to set up a 
situation where the child can be severely scolded not only by the internal parent but by any 
parental figures in the environment who are interested enough to oblige hence the therapy of this 
game should be concentrated not on the drinking but on the morning after the selfindulgence in 
selfcastigation there is a type of heavy drinker however who does not have hangovers and such 
people do not belong in the present category 
there is also a game dry alcoholic in which white goes through the process of financial or 
social degradation without a bottle making the same sequence of moves and requiring the same 
supporting cast here again the morning after is the crux of the matter indeed it is the similarity 
between dry alcoholic and regular alcoholic which emphasizes that both are games for 
example the procedure for getting discharged from a job is the same in both addict is similar to 
alcoholic but more sinister more dramatic more sensational and faster in our society at least 
it leans more heavily on the readily available persecutor with patsies and rescuers being few and 
far between and the connection playing a much more central role 
there are a variety of organizations involved in alcoholic some of them national or even 
international in scope others local many of them publish rules for the game nearly all of them 
explain how to play the role of alcoholic take a drink before breakfast spend money allotted for 
other purposes etc they also explain the function of the rescuer alcoholics anonymous for 
example continues playing the actual game but concentrates on inducing the alcoholic to take the 
role of rescuer former alcoholics are preferred because they know how the game goes and hence 
are better qualified to play the supporting role than people who have never played before cases 
have been reported of a chapter of aa running out of alcoholics to work on whereupon the 
members resumed drinking since there was no other way to continue the game in the absence of 
people to rescue 
there are also organizations devoted to improving the lot of the other players some put pressure 
on the spouses to shift their roles from persecutor to rescuer the one which seems to come closest 
to the theoretical ideal of treatment deals with teenage offspring of alcoholics these young people 
are encouraged to break away from the game itself rather than merely shift their roles 
the psychological cure of an alcoholic also lies in getting him to stop playing the game altogether 
rather than simply change from one role to another in some cases this has been feasible although it 
is a difficult task to find something else as interesting to the alcoholic as continuing his game 
since he is classically afraid of intimacy the substitute may have to be another game rather than a 
gamefree relationship often socalled cured alcoholics are not very stimulating company socially 
and possibly they feel a lack of excitement in their lives and are continually tempted to go back to 
their old ways the criterion of a true game cure is that the former alcoholic should be able to 
drink socially without putting himself in jeopardy the usual total abstinence cure will not satisfy 
the game analyst 
it is apparent from the description of this game that there is a strong temptation for the rescuer to 
play i am only trying to help you for the persecutor to play look what you have done to me 
and for the patsy to play good joe with the rise of rescue organizations which publicize the idea 

31

 
that alcoholism is a disease alcoholics have been taught to play wooden leg the law which 
takes a special interest in such people tends to encourage this nowadays the emphasis has shifted 
from the persecutor to the rescuer from i am a sinner to what do you expect from a sick 
mane1 part of the trend in modern thinking away from religion and toward science from an 
existential point of view the shift is questionable and from a practical point of view it seems to 
have done little to diminish the sale of liquor to heavy 
in the underworld slang patsy once meant all right or satisfactory and later came to denote a 
pigeon drinkers nevertheless alcoholics anonymous is still for most people the best initiation 
into the therapy of overindulgence 
antithesis as is well known alcoholic is usually played hard and is difficult to give up in one 
case a female alcoholic in a therapy group participated very little until she thought she knew 
enough about the other members to go ahead with her game she then asked them to tell her what 
they thought of her since she had behaved pleasantly enough various members said nice things 
about her but she protested that is not what i want i want to know what you really think she 
made it clear that she was seeking derogatory comments the other women refused to persecute her 
whereupon she went home and told her husband that if she took another drink he must either 
divorce her or send her to a hospital he promised to do this and that evening she became 
intoxicated and he sent her to a sanitarium here the other members refused to play the persecutory 
roles white assigned to them she was unable to tolerate this antithetical behavior in spite of 
everyone is efforts to reinforce whatever insight she had already obtained at home she found 
someone who was willing to play the role she demanded 
in other cases however it appears possible to prepare the patient sufficiently so that the game can 
be given up and to attempt a true social cure in which the therapist declines to play either 
persecutor or rescuer it is equally untherapeutic for him to play the role of patsy by allowing the 
patient to forego his financial and punctuality obligations the correct therapeutic procedure from a 
transactional point of view is after careful preliminary groundwork to take an adult contractual 
position and refuse to play any of the roles hoping that the patient will be able to tolerate not only 
abstinence from drinking but also from playing his game if he cannot he is best referred to a 
rescuer 
antithesis is particularly difficult because the heavy drinker is highly regarded in most western 
countries as a desirable object for censure concern or generosity and someone who refuses to play 
any of these roles tends to arouse public indignation a rational approach may be even more 
alarming to the rescuers than to the alcoholic sometimes with unfortunate consequences to the 
therapy in one clinical situation a group of workers were seriously interested in the game 
alcoholic and were attempting to effect real cures by breaking up the game rather than merely 
rescuing the patients as soon as this became apparent they were frozen out by the lay committee 
which was backing the clinic and none of them was ever again called on to assist in treating these 
patients 
relatives an interesting byplay in alcoholic is called have one this was discovered by a 
perceptive student of industrial psychiatry white and his wife a nondrinking persecutor go on a 
picnic with black and his wife both patsies white says to the blacks have one if they have 
one this gives white license to have four or five the game is unmasked if the blacks refuse 
white by the rules of drinking is then entitled to be insulted and he will find more compliant 
companions for his next picnic what appears at the social level to be adult generosity is at the 
psychological level an act of insolence whereby whites child obtains parental indulgence from 
black by open bribery under the very nose of mrs white who is powerless to protest actually it is 
just because she will be powerless to protest dial mrs white consents to the whole arrangement 
since she is just as anxious for the game to continue with herself in the role of persecutor as mr 
white is with himself in the role of alcoholic her recriminations against him in the morning after 
die picnic are easy to imagine this variant can cause complications if white is blacks boss 
in general the patsy is not as badly off as the name implies patsies are often lonely people who 
have a great deal to gain by being nice to alcoholics the delicatessen man who plays good joe 

32

 
makes many acquaintances in this way and he can get a good reputation in his own social circle 
not only as a generous person but also as a good storyteller 
one variant of good joe incidentally is to go around asking for advice about how best to help 
people this is an example of a jolly and constructive game worth encouraging its inverse is tough 
guy taking lessons in violence or asking for advice about how best to hurt people although the 
mayhem is never put into practice the player has the privilege of associating with real tough guys 
who are playing for keeps and can bask in their reflected glory this is one species of what the 
french call un fanfaron de vice

2 debtor 
thesis debtor is more than a game in america it tends to become a script a plan for a whole 
lifetime just as it does in some of the jungles of africa and new guinea2 there the relatives of a 
young man buy him a bride at an enormous price putting him in their debt for years to come here 
die same custom prevails at least in the more civilized sections of the country except that the bride 
price becomes a house price and if there is no stake from the relatives this role is taken on by the 
bank thus the young man in new guinea with an old wrist watch dangling from his ear to ensure 
success and the young man in america with a new wrist watch wrapped around his arm to ensure 
success both feel that they have a purpose in life the big celebration the wedding or 
housewarming takes place not when the debt is discharged but when it is undertaken what is 
emphasized on tv for example is not the middleaged man who has finally paid off his mortgage 
but the young man who moves into his new home with his family proudly waving the papers he 
has just signed and which will bind him for most of his productive years after he has paid his 
debtsthe mortgage the college expenses for his children and his insurancehe is regarded as a 
problem a senior citizen for whom society must provide not only material comforts but a new 
purpose as in new guinea if he is very shrewd he may become a big creditor instead of a big 
debtor but this happens relatively rarely 
as this is written a sow bug crawls across a desk if he is turned over on his back one can observe 
the tremendous struggle he goes through to get on his feet again during this interval he has a 
purpose in his life when he succeeds one can almost see the look of victory on his face off he 
goes and one can imagine him telling his tale at the next meeting of sow bugs looked up to by the 
younger generation as an insect who has made it and yet mixed with his smugness is a little 
disappointment now that he has come out on top life seems aimless maybe he will return in the 

33

 
 
 
hope of repeating his triumph it might be worth marking his back with ink so as to recognize him 
if he risks it a courageous animal the sow bug no wonder he has survived for millions of years 
most young americans however take their mortgages very seriously only in times of stress if 
they are depressed or the economic situation is bad their obligations keep them going and may 
prevent some of them from committing suicide most of the time they play a mild game of if it 
were not for the debts but otherwise enjoy themselves only a few make a career out of playing a 
hard game of debtor 
try and collect tag is commonly played by young married couples and illustrates how a 
game is set up so that the player wins whichever way it goes the whites obtain all sorts of goods 
and services on credit petty or luxurious depending on their backgrounds and how they were 
taught to play by their parents or grandparents if the creditor gives up after a few soft efforts to 
collect then the whites can enjoy their gains without penalty and in this sense they win if the 
creditor makes more strenuous attempts then they enjoy the pleasures of the chase as well as the 
use of their purchases the hard form of the game occurs if the creditor is determined to collect in 
order to get his money he will have to resort to extreme measures these usually have a coercive 
elementgoing to whites employers or driving up to his house in a noisy garish truck labeled in 
big letters collection agency 
at this point there is a switch white now knows that he will probably have to pay but because of 
the coercive element made clear in most cases by the third letter from the collector if you do 
not appear at our office within 48 hours    white feels peremptorily justified in getting angry 
he now switches over to a variant of now i have got you you son of a bitch in this case he wins 
by demonstrating that the creditor is greedy ruthless and untrustworthy the two most obvious 
advantages of this are 1 it strengthens whites existential position which is a disguised form of 
all creditors are grasping and 2 it offers a large external social gain since he is now in a 
position to abuse the creditor openly to his friends without losing his own status as a good joe 
he may also exploit further internal social gain by confronting the creditor himself in addition it 
vindicates his taking advantage of the credit system if that is the way creditors are as he has now 
shown why pay anybody 
creditor in the form try and get away with it tagawi is sometimes played by small 
landlords tag and tagawi players readily recognize each other and because of the prospective 
transactional advantages and the promised sport they are secretly pleased and readily become 
involved with each other regardless of who wins the money each has improved the others 
position for playing why does this always happen to me after it is all over 
money games can have very serious consequences if these descriptions sound facetious as they do 
to some people it is not because they relate to trivia but because of the exposure of trivial 
motivations behind matters people are taught to take seriously 
antithesis the obvious antithesis of tag is to request immediate payment in cash but a good 
tag player has methods for getting around that which will work on any but the most hardboiled 
creditors the antithesis of tagawi is promptness and honesty since hard tag and tagawi 
players are both professionals in every sense of die word an amateur stands as much chance 
playing against them as he does playing against professional gamblers while the amateur seldom 
wins he can at least enjoy himself if he becomes involved in one of these games since both are by 
tradition played grimly nothing is more disconcerting to the professionals than to have an amateur 
victim laugh at the outcome in financial circles this is considered strictly out in the cases reported 
to this writer laughing at a debtor when one encounters him on the street is just as bewildering 
frustrating and disconcerting to him as playing antischlemiel is to a schlemiel 

3 kick me 
thesis this is played by men whose social manner is equivalent to wearing a sign that reads 
please do not kick me the temptation is almost irresistible and when the natural result follows 
white cries piteously but the sign says do not kick me then he adds incredulously why does 
this always happen to me wahm clinically the wahm may be introjected and disguised in 

34

 
the psychiatry cliche whenever i am under stress i get all shook up one game element in 
wahm comes from inverse pride my misfortunes are better than yours this factor is often 
found in paranoids 
if the people in his environment are restrained from striking at him by kindheartedness i am only 
trying to help you social convention or organizational rules his behavior becomes more and 
more provocative until he transgresses the limits and forces them to oblige these are men who are 
cast out the jilted and the job losers 
the corresponding game among women is threadbare1 often genteel they take pains to be 
shabby they see to it that their earnings for good reasons never rise much above the subsistence 
level if they have a windfall there are always enterprising young men who will help them get rid 
of it giving them in return shares in a worthless business promotion or something equivalent 
colloquially such a woman is called mothers friend always ready to give judicious parental 
advice and living vicariously on the experience of others their wahm is a silent one and only 
heir demeanor of brave struggle suggests why does this always happen to me 
an interesting form of wahm occurs in welladapted people who reap increasing rewards and 
successes often beyond their own expectations here the wahm may lead to serious and 
constructive thinking and to personal growth in the best sense if it takes the form what did i 
really do to deserve this 

4 now i have got you you son of a bitch 
thesis this can be seen in classic form in poker games white gets an unbeatable hand such as 
four aces at this point if he is a nigysob player he is more interested in the fact that black is 
completely at his mercy than he is in good poker or making money 
white needed some plumbing fixtures installed and he reviewed the costs very carefully with the 
plumber before giving him a goahead the price was set and it was agreed that there would be no 
extras when the plumber submitted his bill he included a few dollars extra for an unexpected 
valve that had to be installedabout four dollars on a fourhundreddollar job white became 
infuriated called the plumber on the phone and demanded an explanation the plumber would not 
back down white wrote him a long letter criticizing his integrity and ethics and refused to pay the 
bill until the extra charge was withdrawn the plumber finally gave in 
it soon became obvious that both white and the plumber were playing games in the course of their 
negotiations they bad recognized each others potentials the plumber made his provocative move 
when he submitted this bill since white had the plumbers word the plumber was clearly in the 
wrong white now felt justified in venting almost unlimited rage against him instead of merely 
negotiating in a dignified way that befit the adult standards he set for himself perhaps with a little 
innocent annoyance white took the opportunity to make extensive criticisms of the plumbers 
whole way of living on the surface their argument was adult to adult a legitimate business 
dispute over a stated sum of money at the psychological level it was parent to adult white was 
exploiting his trivial but socially defensible objection position to vent the pentup furies of many 
years on his cozening opponent just as his mother might have done in a similar situation he 
quickly recognized his underlying attitude nigysob and realized how secretly delighted he had 
been at the plumbers provocation he then recalled that ever since early childhood he had looked 
for similar injustices received diem with delight and exploited them with the same vigor in many 
of the cases he recounted he had forgotten the actual provocation but remembered in great detail 
the course of the ensuing battle the plumber apparently was playing some variation of why 
does this always happen to me wahm 
nigysob is a twohanded game which must be distinguished from are not it awful aia in 
aia the agent seeks injustices in order to complain about them to a third party making a three
handed game aggressor victim confidant aia is played under the slogan misery loves 
company the confidant is usually someone who also plays aia wahm is threehanded too 
but here the agent is trying to establish his preeminence in misfortune and resents competition 

35

 
 
from other unfortunates nigysob is commercialized in a threehanded professional form as the 
badger game it may also be played as a twohanded marital game in more or less subtle forms 
antithesis the best antithesis is correct behavior the contractual structure of a relationship with a 
nigysob player should be explicitly stated in detail at the first opportunity and the rules strictly 
adhered to in clinical practice for example the question of payment for missed appointments or 
cancellations must be settled clearly at once and extra precautions must be taken to avoid mistakes 
in bookkeeping if an unforeseen contretemps arises the antithesis is to yield gracefully without 
dispute until such time as the therapist is prepared to deal with the game in everyday life business 
dealings with nigysob players are always calculated risks the wife of such a person should be 
treated with polite correctness and even the mildest flirtations gallantries or slights should be 
avoided especially if the husband himself seems to encourage them

people cannot be trusted 

5 see what you made me do  
thesis in its classical form this is a marital game and in fact is a threestar marriage buster but 
it may also be played between parents and children and in working life 
1 firstdegree swymd white feeling unsociable becomes engrossed in some activity which 
tends to insulate him against people perhaps all he wants at the moment is to be left alone an 
intruder such as his wife or one of his children comes either for stroking or to ask him something 
like where can i find the longnosed pliers this interruption causes his chisel paintbrush 
typewriter or soldering iron to slip whereupon he turns on the intruder in a rage and cries see 
what you made me do as this is repeated through the years his family tends more and more to 
leave him alone when he is engrossed of course it is not the intruder but his own irritation which 
causes the slip and he is only too happy when it occurs since it gives him a lever for ejecting the 
visitor unfortunately this is a game which is only too easily learned by young children so that it is 
easily passed on from generation to generation the underlying satisfaction and advantages are 
more clearly demonstrated when it is played more seductively 
2 seconddegree swymd if swymd is the basis for a way of life rather than merely being 
used occasionally as a protective mechanism white marries a woman who plays i am only trying 
to help you or one of its relatives it is then easy for him to defer decisions to her often this may 
be done in the guise of considerateness or gallantry he may deferentially and courteously let her 
decide where to go for dinner or which movie to see if things cum out well he can enjoy them if 
not he can blame her by saying or implying you got me into this a simple variation of 
swymd or he may throw the burden of decisions regarding the childrens upbringing on her 
while he acts as executive officer if the children get upset he can play a straight game of swymd 
this lays the groundwork through the years for blaming mother if the children turn out badly then 

36

 
 
 
swymd is not an end in itself but merely offers passing satisfaction on the way to i told you 
so or see what you have done now 
the professional player who pays his psychological way with swymd will use it also in his work 
in occupational swymd the longsuffering look of resentment replaces words the player 
democratically or as part of good management asks his assistants for suggestions in this way 
he may attain an unassailable position for terrorizing his juniors any mistake he makes can be 
used against them by blaming them for it used against seniors blaming them for ones mistakes 
it becomes selfdestructive and may lead to termination of employment or in the army to transfer 
to another unit in that case it is a component of why does this always happen to me with 
resentful people or of there i go again with depressives both of the kick me family 
3 thirddegree swymd in a hard form swymd may be played by paranoids against people 
incautious enough to give them advice see i am only trying to help you there it may be 
dangerous and in rare cases even fatal 
see what you made me do swymd and you got me into this ugmit complement 
each other nicely so that the swymdugmit combination is a classical basis for the covert game 
contract in many marriages this contract is illustrated by the following sequence 
by mutual agreement mrs white did the family bookkeeping and paid the bills out of the joint 
checking account because mr white was poor at figures every few months they would be 
notified of an overdraft and mr white would have to square it with the bank when they looked 
for the source of the difficulty it would turn out that mrs white had made an expensive purchase 
without telling her husband when this came to light mr white would furiously play his ugmit 
and she would tearfully accept his rebuke and promise it would not happen again everything 
would go smoothly for a while and then a creditors agent would suddenly appear to demand 
payment for a longoverdue bill mr white not having heard of this bill would question his wife 
about it she would then play her swymd saying that it was his fault since he had forbidden her 
to overdraw their account the only way she could make ends meet was by leaving this large 
obligation unpaid and hiding the duns from him 
these games had been allowed to go on for ten years on the basis that each occurrence would be 
the last and that from then on it would be differentwhich it was for a few months in therapy mr 
white very cleverly analyzed this game without any assistance from the therapist and also devised 
an effective remedy by mutual agreement he and mrs white put all charge accounts and their 
bank account in his name mrs white continued to do the bookkeeping and make out the checks 
but mr white saw the hills first and controlled the outgoing payments in this way neither duns nor 
overdrafts could get by him and they now shared the budgetary labor deprived of die satisfactions 
and advantages of swymdugmit the whites were at first at a loss and were then driven to 
find more open and constructive types of gratification from each other 
antithesis the antithesis to firstdegree swymd is to leave the player alone and to second
degree swymd to throw the decision back on white the firstdegree player may react by 
feeling forlorn but seldom angry the seconddegree player may become sulky if he is forced to 
take the initiative so that systematic antiswymd leads to disagreeable consequences the 
antithesis to thirddegree swymd should be put into competent professional hands 

partial analysis 
the aim of this game is vindication dynamically the mild form may be related to premature 
ejaculation the hard form to rage based on castration anxiety it is easily acquired by children 
the external psychological gain  avoidance of responsibility is prominent and the game is often 
precipitated by the threat of impending intimacy since the justifiable anger offers a good excuse 
for avoiding sexual relations the existential position is i am blameless

chapter seven 
marital game 

almost any game can form the scaffolding for married life and family living but some such as 
if it were not for you flourish better or like frigid woman are tolerated longer under the 
legal force of contractual intimacy marital games of course can only be arbitrarily separated from 
sexual games which are treated is a separate section those games which characteristically evolve 
into their most fullblown forms in the marital relationship include comer courtroom frigid 
woman and frigid man harried if it were not for you look how hard i have tried and 
sweetheart 

1 corner 
thesis comer illustrates more clearly than most games their manipulative aspect and their function 
as barriers to intimacy paradoxically it consists of a disingenuous refusal to play the game of 
another 
1 mrs white suggests to her husband that they go to a movie mr white agrees 
2a mrs white makes an unconscious slip she mentions quite naturally in the course of 
conversation that the house needs painting this is an expensive project and white has recently 
told her that their finances are strained he requested her not to embarrass or annoy him by 
suggesting unusual expenditures at least until the beginning of the new month this is therefore an 
illchosen moment to bring up the condition of the house and white responds rudely 
2b alternatively white steers the conversation around to the house making it difficult for mrs 
white to resist die temptation to say that it needs painting as in the previous case white responds 
rudely 
3 mrs white takes offense and says that if he is in one of his bad moods she will not go to die 
movie with him and he had best go by himself he says if that is die way she feels about it he will 
go alone 
4 white goes to die movie or out with the boys leaving mrs white at home to nurse her injured 
feelings there are two possible gimmicks in this game a mrs white knows very well from past 
experience that she is not supposed to take his annoyance seriously what he really wants is for her 
to show some appreciation of how hard he works to earn their living then they could go off happily 
together but she refuses to play and he feels badly lei down he leaves filled with disappointment 
and resentment while she stays at home looking abused but with a secret feeling of triumph 
b white knows very well from past experience that he is not supposed to take her pique seriously 
what she really wants is to be honeyed out of it then they would go off happily together but he 
refuses to play knowing that his refusal is dishonest he knows she wants to be coaxed but 
pretends he does not he leaves the house feeling cheerful and relieved but looking wronged she is 
left feeling disappointed and resentful 
in each of these cases die winners position is from a naive standpoint irreproachable all he or she 
has done is take the other literally this is clearer in b where white takes mrs whites refusal to 
go at face value they both know that this is cheating but since she said it she is cornered 
the most obvious gain here is die external psychological both of diem find movies sexually 
stimulating and it is more or less anticipated that after they return from the theater they will make 
love hence whichever one of them wants to avoid intimacy sets up the game in move 2a or 2b 
this is a particularly exasperating variety of uproar see chapter 9 the wronged party can of 
course make a good case for not wanting to make love in a state of justifiable indignation and the 
cornered spouse has no recourse 
antithesis this is simple for mrs white all she has to do is change her mind take her husband 
by the arm smile and go along with him a shift from child to adult ego state it is more difficult 
for mr white since she now has die initiative but if he reviews die whole situation he may be 

39

 
 
able to coax her into going along with him either as a sulky child who has been placated or better 
as an adult 
comer is found in a somewhat different form as a family game involving the children where it 
resembles the doublebind described by bateson and his associates1 here the child is cornered 
so that whatever he does is wrong according to the bateson school this may be an important 
etiological factor in schizophrenia in the present language then schizophrenia may be a childs 
antithesis to corner experience in treating adult schizophrenics with game analysis bears this 
outthat is if the family game of comer is analyzed to demonstrate that the schizophrenic 
behavior was and is specifically undertaken to counter this game partial or total remission occurs 
in a properly prepared patient 
an everyday form of corner which is played by the whole family and is most likely to affect the 
character development of the younger children occurs with meddlesome parental parents the 
little boy or girl is urged to be more helpful around the house but when he is the parents find fault 
with what he doesa homely example of damned if you do and damned if you do not this 
doublebind may be called the dilemma type of corner 
corner is sometimes found as an etiological factor in asthmatic children 
little girl mommy do you love me mother what is love 
this answer leaves the child with no direct recourse she wants to talk about mother and mother 
switches the subject to philosophy which the little girl is not equipped to handle she begins to 
breathe hard mother is irritated asthma sets in mother apologizes and the asthma game now 
runs its course this asthma type of corner remains to be studied further 
an elegant variant which may be called the russellwhitehead type of corner sometimes 
occurs in therapy groups 
black well anyway when were silent nobody is playing games 
white silence itself may be a game 
red nobody was playing games today 
white but not playing games may itself be a game 
the therapeutic antithesis is equally elegant logical paradoxes are forbidden when white is 
deprived of this maneuver his underlying anxieties come quickly to the fore closely allied to 
corner on the one hand and to threadbare on the other is the marital game of lunch bag 
the husband who can well afford to have lunch at a good restaurant nevertheless makes himself a 
few sandwiches every morning which he takes to the office in a paper bag in this way he uses up 
crusts of bread leftovers from dinner and paper bags which his wife saves for him this gives him 
complete control over the family finances for what wife would dare buy herself a mink stole in die 
face of such selfsacrifice the husband reaps numerous other advantages such as die privilege of 
eating lunch by himself and of catching up on his work during lunch hour in many ways this is a 
constructive game which benjamin franklin would have approved of since it encourages the 
virtues of thrift hard work and punctuality 

2 courtroom 
thesis descriptively this belongs to the class of games which find their most florid expressions in 
law and which includes wooden leg the plea of insanity and debtor the civil suit 
clinically it is most often seen in marital counseling and marital psychotherapy groups indeed 
some marital counseling and marital groups consist of a perpetual game of courtroom in which 
nothing is resolved since the game is never broken up in such cases it becomes evident that the 
counselor or therapist is heavily involved in the game without being aware of it 
courtroom can be played by any number but is essentially threehanded with a plaintiff a 
defendant and a judge represented by a husband a wife and the therapist if it is played in a 
therapy group or over the radio or tv die other members of the audience are cast as the jury the 
husband begins plaintively let me tell you what wifes name did yesterday she took the    
etc etc the wife then responds defensively here is the way it really was    and besides just 

40

 
 
before that he was    and anyway at die time we were both    etc the husband adds gallantly 
well i am glad you people have a chance to hear both sides of the story i only want to be fair at 
this point the counselor says judiciously it seems to me that if we consider    etc etc if there is 
an audience the therapist may throw it to them with well let us hear what the others have to say 
or if the group is already trained they will play the jury without any instruction from him 
antithesis the therapist says to the husband you are absolutely right if the husband relaxes 
complacently or triumphantly the therapist asks how do you feel about my saying that the 
husband replies fine then the therapist says actually i feel you are in the wrong if the 
husband is honest he will say i knew that all along if be is not honest he will show some 
reaction that makes it clear a game is in progress then it becomes possible to go into the matter 
further the game element lies in the fact that while the plaintiff is overtly clamoring for victory 
fundamentally he believes that he is wrong 
after sufficient clinical material has been gathered to clarify the situation the game can be 
interdicted by a maneuver which is one of the most elegant in the whole art of antithetics the 
therapist makes a rule prohibiting the use of the grammatical third person in the group 
thenceforward the members can only address each other directly as you or talk about themselves 
as i but they cannot say let me tell you about him or let me tell you about her at this point 
the couple stop playing games in the group altogether or shift into sweetheart which is some 
improvement or take up furthermore which is no help at all sweetheart is described in 
another section page 107 in furthermore the plaintiff makes one accusation after the other the 
defendant replies to each i can explain the plaintiff pays no attention to the explanation but as 
soon as the defendant pauses he launches into his next indictment with another furthermore 
which is followed by another explanationa typical parentchild interchange 
furthermore is played most intensively by paranoid defendants because of their literalness it is 
particularly easy for them to frustrate accusers who express themselves in humorous or 
metaphorical terms in general metaphors are the most obvious traps to avoid in a game of 
furthermore 
in its everyday form courtroom is easily observed in children as a threehanded game between 
two siblings and a parent mommy she took my candy away yes but he took my doll and 
before that he was hitting me and anyway we both promised to share our candy

3 frigid woman 
thesis this is almost always a marital game since it is hardly conceivable that an informal liaison 
would present the required opportunities and privileges over a sufficient length of time or that such 
a liaison would be maintained in the face of it 

41

 
 
 
the husband makes advances to his wife and is repulsed after repeated attempts he is told that all 
men are beasts he does not really love her or does not love her for herself that all he is interested in 
is sex he desists for a time then tries again with the same result eventually he resigns himself and 
makes no further advances as the weeks or months pass the wife becomes increasingly informal 
and sometimes forgetful she walks through the bedroom half dressed or forgets her clean towel 
when she takes a bath so that he has to bring it to her if she plays a hard game or drinks heavily 
she may become flirtatious with other men at parties at length he responds to those provocations 
and tries again once more he is repulsed and a game of uproar ensues involving their recent 
behavior other couples their inlaws their finances and their failures terminated by a slamming 
door 
this time the husband makes up his mind that he is really through that they will find a sexless 
modus vivendi months pass he declines the negligee parade and the forgotten towel maneuver 
the wife becomes more provocatively informal and more provocatively forgetful but he still 
resists then one evening she actually approaches him and kisses him at first he does not respond 
remembering his resolution but soon nature begins to take its course after the long famine and 
now he thinks he surely has it made his first tentative advances are not repulsed he becomes 
bolder and bolder just at the critical point the wife steps back and cries see what did i tell you 
all men are beasts all i wanted was affection but all you are interested in is sex the ensuing 
game of uproar at this point may skip the preliminary phases of their recent behavior and their 
inlaws and go right to the financial problem 
it should be noted that in spite of his protestations the husband is usually just as afraid of sexual 
intimacy as his wife is and has carefully chosen his mate to minimize  the danger of overtaxing 
his disturbed potency which he can now blame on her 
in its everyday form this game is played by unmarried ladies of various ages which soon earns 
them a common slang epidiet with diem it often merges into the game of indignation or rapo 
antithesis this is a dangerous game and the possible antitheses are equally dangerous taking a 
mistress is a gamble in the face of such stimulating competition the wife may give up the game 
and try to initiate a normal married life perhaps too late on the other hand she may use the affair 
often with the help of a lawyer as ammunition against the husband in a game of now i have got 
you you son of a bitch the outcome is equally unpredictable if the husband undertakes 
psychotherapy and she does not the wifes game may collapse as the husband grows stronger 
leading to healthier adjustment but if she is a hard player improvement on his part may result in 
divorce the best solution if available is for both parties to go into a transactional marital group 
where the underlying advantages of the game and the basic sexual pathology can be laid bare with 
this preparation both spouses may become interested in intensive individual psychotherapy that 
may result in a psychological remarriage if not at least each of the parties may make a more 
sensible readjustment to the situation than they might have otherwise 
the decent antithesis for the everyday form is to find another social companion some of the 
shrewder or more brutal antitheses are corrupt and even criminal 
relatives the converse game frigid man is less common but it takes much the same general 
course with some variations in detail the final outcome depends upon the scripts of the parties 
involved 
the crucial point of frigid woman is the terminal phase of uproar once this has run its course 
sexual intimacy is out of the question since both parties derive a perverse satisfaction from 
uproar and have no need of further sexual excitement from each other hence the most important 
item in antifrigid woman is to decline uproar this leaves the wife in a state of sexual 
dissatisfaction which may be so acute that she will become more compliant the use made of 
uproar distinguishes frigid woman from beat me daddy where uproar is part of the 
foreplay in frigid woman uproar substitutes for the sex act itself thus in beat me daddy 
uproar is a condition of the sexual act a kind of fetish which increases the excitement while in 
frigid woman once uproar has taken place die episode is finished 

42

 
an early analogue of frigid woman is played by that type of prissy little girl described by 
dickens in great expectations she comes out in her starched dress and asks the little boy to make 
her a mud pie then she sneers at his dirty hands and clothing and tells him how clean she is

4 harried 
thesis this is a game played by the harried housewife her situation requires that she be proficient 
in ten or twelve different occupations or stated otherwise that she fill gracefully ten or twelve 
different roles from time to time semifacetious lists of these occupations or roles appear in the 
sunday supplements mistress mother nurse housemaid etc since these roles are usually 
conflicting and fatiguing their imposition gives rise in the course of years to the condition 
symbolically known as housewifes knee since the knee is used for rocking scrubbing lifting 
driving and so forth whose symptoms are succinctly summarized in the complaint i am tired 
now if the housewife is able to set her own pace and find enough satisfaction in loving her 
husband and children she will not merely serve but enjoy her twentyfive years and see the 
youngest child off to college with a pang of loneliness but if on die one hand she is driven by her 
inner parent and called to account by the critical husband she has chosen for that purpose and on 
the other unable to get sufficient satisfaction from loving her family she may grow more and more 
unhappy at first she may try to console herself with the advantages of if it were not for you and 
blemish and indeed any housewife may fall back on these when the going gets rough but soon 
these fail to keep her going then she has to find another way out and that is the game of 
harried 
the thesis of this game is simple she takes on everything that comes and even asks for more she 
agrees with her husbands criticisms and accepts all her childrens demands if she has to entertain 
at dinner she not only feels she must function impeccably as a conversationalist chatelaine over 
the household and servants interior decorator caterer glamour girl virgin queen and diplomat she 
will also volunteer that morning to bake a cake and take the children to the dentist if she already 
feels harassed she makes the day even more harried then in the middle of the afternoon she 
justifiably collapses and nothing gets done she let us down her husband the children and their 
guests and her selfreproaches add to her misery after this happens two or three times her 
marriage is in jeopardy the children are confused she loses weight her hair is untidy her face is 
drawn and her shoes are scuffed then she appears at the psychiatrists office ready to be 
hospitalized 
antithesis the logical antithesis is simple mrs white can fill each of her roles in succession 
during the week but she must refuse to play two or more of them simultaneously when she gives a 
cocktail party for example she can play either caterer or nursemaid but not both if she is merely 
suffering from housewifes knee she may be able to limit herself in this way 

43

 
 
 
if she is actually playing a game of harried however it will be very difficult for her to adhere to 
this principle in that case the husband is carefully chosen he is an otherwise reasonable man who 
will criticize his wife if she is not as efficient as he thinks his mother was in effect she marries his 
fantasy of his mother as perpetuated in his parent which is similar to her fantasy of her mother or 
grandmother having found a suitable partner her child can now settle into the harassed role 
necessary to maintain her psychic balance and which she will not readily give up the more 
occupational responsibility the husband has the easier it is for both of them to find adult reasons to 
preserve the unhealthy aspects of their relationship 
when the position becomes untenable often because of official school intervention on behalf of the 
unhappy offspring the psychiatrist is called in to make it a threehanded game either the husband 
wants him to do an overhaul job in the wife or the wife wants him as an ally against the husband 
the ensuing proceedings depend on the skill and alertness of die psychiatrist usually the first 
phase the alleviation of the wifes depression will proceed smoothly the second phase in which 
she will give up playing harried in favor of playing psychiatry is the decisive one it tends to 
arouse increasing opposition from both spouses sometimes this is well concealed and then 
explodes suddenly though not unexpectedly if this stage is weathered then the real work of game 
analysis can proceed 
it is necessary to recognize that the real culprit is the wifes parent her mother or grandmother the 
husband is to some extent only a lay figure chosen to play his role in die game the therapist has to 
fight not only this parent and the husband who has a heavy investment in playing his end but also 
the social environment which encourages the wifes compliance the week after the article appears 
about the many roles a housewife has to play there is a hownt i doing in the sunday paper a 
tenitem test to determine how good a hostess wife modier housekeeper budgeteer are 
you for the housewife who plays harried that is the equivalent of the little leaflet that comes 
with childrens games stating the rules it may help to speed up die evolution of harried which 
if not checked may end in a game of state hospital the last thing i want is to be sent to a 
hospital 
one practical difficulty with such couples is that die husband tends to avoid personal involvement 
with the treatment beyond playing look how hard i am trying because he is usually more 
disturbed than he cares to admit instead he may send indirect messages to the therapist through 
temper outbursts which he knows will be reported by the wife hence harried easily progresses 
to a thirddegree lifedeathdivorce struggle the psychiatrist is almost alone on the side of life 
assisted only by the harried adult of the patient which is locked in combat that may prove mortal 
against all three aspects of the husband allied with her own inner parent and child it is a dramatic 
battle with odds of two against five which tries the skill of the most gamefree and professional 
therapist if he quails he can take the easy way out and offer his patient on the altar of the divorce 
court which is equivalent to saying i surrenderlets you and him fight 

5 if it were not for you 
thesis the detailed analysis of this game has already been given in chapter 5 it was historically 
die second game uncovered after why do not youyes but which up to that point had been 
regarded merely as an interesting phenomenon with the additional discovery of iwfy it became 
clear that there must be a whole department of social action based on ulterior transactions this led 
to a more active search for such goingson and the present collection is one outcome 
briefly a woman marries a domineering man so that he will restrict her activities and thus keep her 
from getting into situations which frighten her if this were a simple operation she might express 
her gratitude when he performed this service for her in the game of iwfy however her reaction 
is quite the opposite she takes advantage of the situation to complain about the restrictions which 
makes her spouse feel uneasy and gives her all sorts of advantages this game is the internal social 
advantage the external social advantage is the derivative pastime if it were not for him which 
she plays with her congenial lady friends 

44

 
 
6 look how hard i have tried  
thesis in its common clinical form this is a threehanded game played by a married couple with a 
psychiatrist the husband usually is bucking for a divorce despite loud protestations to the 
contrary while the spouse is more sincere in wanting to continue the marriage he comes to the 
therapist under protest and talks just enough to demonstrate to the wife that he is cooperating 
usually he plays a mild game of psychiatry or courtroom as time passes he exhibits either 
increasingly resentful pseudocompliance or belligerent argumentativeness toward the therapist at 
home he initially shows more understanding and restraint and finally behaves worse than ever 
after one five or ten visits depending on the skill of the therapist he refuses to come any longer 
and goes hunting or fishing instead the wife is then forced into filing for divorce the husband is 
now blameless since his wife has taken the initiative and he has demonstrated his good faith by 
going to the therapist he is in a good position to say to any attorney judge friend or relative 
look how hard i have tried 
antithesis the couple is seen together if onelet us say the husbandis clearly playing this 
game the other is taken into individual treatment and the player is sent on his way on the valid 
ground that he is less ready for therapy he can still get a divorce but only at die expense of 
abandoning his position that he is really trying if necessary the wife can start the divorce and her 
position is much improved since she really has tried the favorable hopedfor outcome is that the 
husband his game broken up will go into a state of despair and then seek treatment elsewhere with 
genuine motivation 
in its everyday form this is easily observed in children as a twohanded game with one parent it is 
played from either of two positions i am helpless or i am blameless the child tries but 
bungles or is unsuccessful if he is helpless the parent has to do it for him if he is blameless the 
parent has no reasonable grounds for punishing him this reveals the elements of the game the 
parents should find out two things which of them taught the child this game and what they are 
doing to perpetuate it 
an interesting though sometimes sinister variant is look how hard i was trying which is 
usually a harder game of the second or third degree this can be illustrated by the case of a hard
working man with a gastric ulcer there are many people with progressive physical disabilities who 
do the best they can to cope with the situation and they may enlist the help of their families in a 
legitimate way such conditions however can also be exploited for ulterior purposes 
first degree a man announces to his wife and friends that he has an ulcer he also let us them know 
that he is continuing to work this elicits their admiration perhaps a person with a painful and 
unpleasant condition is entitled to a certain amount of ostentation as a poor recompense for his 
suffering he should be given due credit for not playing wooden leg instead and deserves some 
reward for continuing to assume his responsibilities in such a case die courteous reply to took 
how hard i am trying is yes we all admire your fortitude and conscientiousness 
second degree a man is told that he has an ulcer but keeps it a secret from his wife and friends 
he continues working and worrying as hard as ever and one day he collapses on the job when his 
wife is notified she gets the message instantly look how hard i was trying now she is 
supposed to appreciate him as she never has before and to feel sorry for all the mean things she has 
said and done in the past in short she is now supposed to love him all previous methods of 
wooing her having failed unfortunately for the husband her manifestations of affection and 
solicitude at this point are more apt to be motivated by guilt than by love deep down she is likely 
to be resentful because he is using unfair leverage against her and has also taken unfair advantage 
of her by keeping his illness a secret in short a diamond bracelet is a much more honest instrument 
of courtship than a perforated stomach she has the option of throwing the jewelry back at him but 
she cannot decently walk out on the ulcer a sudden confrontation with a serious illness is more 
likely to make her feel trapped than won over 

45

 
 
this game can often be discovered immediately after the patient first hears that he has a potentially 
progressive disability if he is going to play it the whole plan will very likely flash through his 
mind at that point and can be recovered by a careful psychiatric review of the situation what is 
recovered is the secret gloating of his child at learning that he has such a weapon masked by his 
adult concern at the practical problems raised by his illness 
third degree even more sinister and spiteful is the sudden unheralded suicide because of serious 
illness the ulcer progresses to cancer and one day the wife who has never been informed that 
anything serious is amiss walks into the bathroom and finds her husband lying there dead the 
note says clearly enough look how hard i was trying if something like this happens twice to 
the same woman it is time for her to find out what she has been playing

7 sweetheart 
thesis this is seen in its fullest flower in the early stages of marital group therapy when the 
parties feel defensive it can also be observed on social occasions white makes a subtly derogatory 
remark about mrs white disguised as an anecdote and ends is not that right sweetheart mrs 
white tends to agree for two ostensibly adult reasons a because the anecdote itself is in the main 
accurately reported and to disagree about what is presented as a peripheral detail but is really the 
essential point of the transaction would seem pedantic b because it would seem surly to disagree 
with a man who calls one sweetheart in public the psychological reason for her agreement 
however is her depressive position she married him precisely because she knew he would perform 
this service for her exposing her deficiencies and thus saving her from the embarrassment of 
having to expose them herself her parents accommodated her the same way when she was little 
next to courtroom this is the most common game played in marital groups the more tense the 
situation and the closer the game is to exposure the more bitterly is the word sweetheart 
enunciated until the underlying resentment becomes obvious on careful consideration it can be 
seen that this is a relative of schlemiel since the significant move is mrs whites implicit 
forgiveness for whites resentment of which she is trying hard not to be aware hence anti
sweetheart is played analogously to antischlemiel you can tell derogatory anecdotes about 
me but please do not call me sweetheart this antithesis carries with it the same perils as does anti
schlemiel a more sophisticated and less dangerous antithesis is to reply yes honey 
in another form the wife instead of agreeing responds with a similar sweetheart type anecdote 
about the husband saying in effect you have a dirty face too dear 
sometimes the endearments are not actually pronounced but a careful listener can hear them even 
when they are unspoken this is sweetheart silent type

party games 

parties are for pastimes and pastimes are for parties including the period before a group 
meeting officially begins but as acquaintanceship ripens games begin to emerge the schlemiel 
and his victim recognize each other as do big daddy and little old me all the familiar but 
disregarded processes of selection get under way in this section four games which are typically 
played in ordinary social situations are considered are not it awful blemish schlemiel and 
why do not youyes but 

1 are not it awful 
thesis this is played in four significant forms parental pastime adult pastime child pastime and 
game in the pastimes there is no denouement or payoff but much unwordly feeling 
1 nowadays is the selfrighteous punitive or even vicious parental pastime sociologically it is 
common among certain types of middleaged women with small independent incomes one such 
woman withdrew from a therapy group when her opening move was met with silence instead of 
with the excited corroboration she was accustomed to in her social circle in this more sophisticated 
group accustomed to game analysis there was a conspicuous lack of togetherness when white 
remarked speaking of not trusting people its no wonder you cannot trust anyone nowadays i was 
looking through the desk of one of my roomers and you will not believe what i found she knew the 
answers to most of the current community problems juvenile delinquency parents too soft 
nowadays divorce wives without enough to do to keep them busy nowadays crime foreigners 
moving into white neighborhoods nowadays and rising prices businessmen too grasping 
nowadays she made it clear that she herself was not soft with her delinquent son nor with her 
delinquent tenants 
nowadays is differentiated from idle gossip by its slogan its no wonder the opening move 
may be the same they say that flossie murgatroyd but in nowadays there is direction and 
closure an explanation may be offered idle gossip merely rambles or trails off 
2 broken skin is the more benevolent adult variation with the slogan what a pity although 
the underlying motivations are equally morbid broken skin deals primarily with the flow of 
blood it is essentially an informal clinical colloquium anyone is eligible to present a case the 
more horrifying the better and details are eagerly considered blows in the face abdominal 
operations and difficult childbirths are accepted topics here the differentiation from idle gossip lies 
in the rivalry and surgical sophistication pathological anatomy diagnosis prognosis and 
comparative case studies are systematically pursued a good prognosis is approved in idle gossip 
but in broken skin a consistently hopeful outlook unless obviously insincere may invoke a 
secret meeting of the credentials committee because the player is non particeps criminis 
3 water cooler or coffee break is the child pastime with the slogan look what they are 
doing to us now this is an organizational variant it may be played after dark in the milder 
political or economic form called bar stool it is actually threehanded the ace being held by the 
often shadowy figure called they 
4 as a game are not it awful finds its most dramatic expression in polysurgery addicts and their 
transactions illustrate its characteristics these are doctorshoppers people who actively seek 
surgery even in the face of sound medical opposition the experience itself the hospitalization and 
surgery brings its own advantages the internal psychological advantage comes from having the 
body mutilated the external psychological advantage lies in the avoidance of all intimacies and 
responsibilities except complete surrender to the surgeon the biological advantages are typified by 

47

 
 
 
 
nursing care the internal social advantages come from the medical and nursing staff and from 
other patients after the patients discharge the external social advantages are gained by provoking 
sympathy and awe in its extreme form this game is played professionally by fraudulent or 
determined liability and malpractice claimants who may earn a living by deliberately or 
opportunistically incurring disabilities they then demand not only sympathy as amateur players 
do but indemnification are not it awful becomes a game then when the player overtly expresses 
distress but is covertly gratified at the prospect of the satisfactions he can wring from his 
misfortune 
in general people who suffer misfortunes may be divided into three classes 
1 those in whom the suffering is inadvertent and unwanted these may or may not exploit the 
sympathy which is so readily offered to them some exploitation is natural enough and may be 
treated with common courtesy 
2 those in whom the suffering is inadvertent but is gratefully received because of the 
opportunities for exploitation it offers here the game is an afterthought a secondary gain in 
freuds sense 
3 those who seek suffering like polysurgery addicts who go from one surgeon to another until 
they find one willing to operate here the game is the primary consideration 

2 blemish 
thesis this game is the source of a large percentage of petty dissension in everyday life it is 
played from the depressive child position i am no good which is protectively transformed into 
the parental position they are no good the players transactional problem is then to prove the 
latter thesis hence blemish players do not feel comfortable with a new person until they have 
found his blemish in its hardest form it may become a totalitarian political game played by 
authoritarian personalities and then it may have serious historical repercussions here its close 
relationship with nowadays is evident in suburban society positive reassurance is obtained from 
playing howm i doing while blemish provides negative reassurance a partial analysis will 
make some of the elements of this game clearer 
the premise may range from the most trivial and extraneous last years hat to the most cynical 
has not got 7000 in the bank sinister not 100 aryan esoteric has not read rilke 
intimate cannot hold his erection or sophisticated what is he trying to prove 
psychodynamically it is usually based on sexual insecurity and its aim is reassurance 
transactionally there is prying morbid curiosity or watchfulness sometimes with parental or adult 
concern charitably masking the childs relish it has the internal psychological advantage of 
warding off depression and the external psychological advantage of avoiding the intimacy which 
might expose whites own blemishes white feels justified in turning away an unfashionable 
woman a man without financial backing a nonaryan an illiterate an impotent man or an 
insecure personality at the same time the prying offers some internal social action with biological 
gain the external social advantage is of the are not it awful familyneighborly type 
an interesting sidelight is that whites choice of premise is independent of his intellectual capacity 
or apparent sophistication thus a man who had held some responsible positions in the foreign 
service of his country told an audience that another country was inferior because among other 
things the men wore jackets with sleeves that were too long in his adult ego state this man was 
quite competent only when playing a parental game like blemish would he mention such 
irrelevancies 

3 schlemiel 
thesis the term schlemiel does not refer to the hero of chamissos novel who was a man 
without a shadow but to a popular yiddish word allied to the german and dutch words for cunning 

48

 
 
 
the schlemiels victim who is something like the goodnatured fellow of paul de kock is 
colloquially called the schlemazl the moves in a typical game of schlemiel are as follows 
1w white spills a highball on the hostesss evening gown 
1b black the host responds initially with rage but he senses often only vaguely that if he shows 
it white wins black therefore pulls himself together and this gives him the illusion that he wins 
2w white says i am sorry 
2b black mutters or cries forgiveness strengthening his illusion that he wins 
3w white then proceeds to inflict other damage on blacks property he breaks things spills 
things and makes messes of various kinds after the cigarette burn in the tablecloth the chair leg 
through the lace curtain and the gravy on the rug whites child is exhilarated because he has 
enjoyed himself in carrying out these procedures for all of which he has been forgiven while 
black has made a gratifying display of suffering selfcontrol thus both of them profit from an 
unfortunate situation and black is not necessarily anxious to terminate the friendship 
as in most games white who makes the first move wins either way if black shows his anger 
white can feel justified in returning the resentment if black restrains himself white can go on 
enjoying his opportunities the real payoff in this game however is not the pleasure of 
destructiveness which is merely an added bonus for white but the fact that he obtains forgiveness 
this leads directly into the antithesis 
antithesis antischlemiel is played by not offering the demanded absolution after white says 
i am sorry black instead of muttering its okay says tonight you can embarrass my wife ruin 
the furniture and wreck the rug but please do not say tm sorry here black switches from being a 
forgiving parent to being an objective adult who takes the full responsibility for having invited 
white in the first place 
the intensity of whites game will be revealed by his reaction which may be quite explosive one 
who plays antischlemiel runs the risk of immediate reprisals or at any rate of making an enemy 
children play schlemiel in an abortive form in which they are not always sure of forgiveness but 
at least have the pleasure of making messes as they learn to comport themselves socially however 
they may take advantage of their increasing sophistication to obtain the forgiveness which is the 
chief goal of the game as played in polite grownup social circles

4 why do not youyes but  
thesis why do not youyes but occupies a special place in game analysis because it was the 
original stimulus for the concept of games it was the first game to be dissected out of its social 

49

 
 
 
context and since it is the oldest subject of game analysis it is one of the best understood it is also 
the game most commonly played at parties and groups of all kinds including psychotherapy groups 
the following example will serve to illustrate its main characteristics 
white my husband always insists on doing our own repairs and he never builds anything right 
black why does not he take a course in carpentry white yes but he does not have time blue 
why do not you buy him some good tools white yes but he does not know how to use them 
red why do not you have your building done by a carpenter 
white yes but that would cost too much brown why do not you just accept what he does the 
way he does it 
white yes but the whole thing might fall down 
such an exchange is typically followed by a silence it is eventually broken by green who may say 
something like that is men for you always trying to show how efficient they are 
ydyb can be played by any number the agent presents a problem the others start to present 
solutions each beginning with why do not you     to each of these white objects with a yes 
but  a good player can stand off the others indefinitely until they all give up whereupon white 
wins in many situations she might have to handle a dozen or more solutions to engineer the 
crestfallen silence which signifies her victory and which leaves the field open for the next game in 
the above paradigm green switching into pi a delinquent husband type 
since the solutions are with rare exceptions rejected it is apparent that this game must serve some 
ulterior purpose ydyb is not played for its ostensible purpose an adult quest for information or 
solutions but to reassure and gratify the child a bare transcript may sound adult but in the 
living tissue it can be observed that white presents herself as a child inadequate to meet the 
situation whereupon the others become transformed into sage parents anxious to dispense their 
wisdom for her benefit

white r yes but 
others s why do not you 

 figure 8  why do not youyes but  

this is illustrated in figure 8 the game can proceed because at the social level both stimulus and 
response are adult to adult and at the psychological level they are also complementary with 
parent to child stimulus why do not you    eliciting child to parent response yes but    
the psychological level is usually unconscious on both sides but the shifts in ego state adult to 
inadequate child on whites part adult to wise parent by the others can often be detected by 
an alert observer from changes in posture muscular tone voice and vocabulary 
in order to illustrate the implications it is instructive to follow through on the example given above 
therapist did anyone suggest anything you had not thought of yourself 

50

 
 
 
 
 
white no they did not as a matter of fact i have actually tried almost everything they suggested i 
did buy my husband some tools and he did take a course in carpentry 
here white demonstrates two of the reasons why the proceedings should not be taken at face value 
first in the majority of cases white is as intelligent as anyone else in the company and it is very 
unlikely that others will suggest any solution that she has not thought of herself if someone does 
happen to come up with an original suggestion white will accept it gratefully if she is playing fair 
that is her inadequate child will give way if anyone present has an idea ingenious enough to 
stimulate her adult but habitual ydyb players such as white above seldom play fair on the 
other hand a too ready acceptance of suggestions raises the question of whether the ydyb is not 
masking an underlying game of stupid 
the example given is particularly dramatic because it clearly illustrates the second point even if 
white has actually tried some of the solutions presented she will still object to them the purpose 
of the game is not to get suggestions but to reject them 
while almost anyone will play this game under proper circumstances because of its time
structuring value careful study of individuals who particularly favor it reveals several interesting 
features first they characteristically can and will play either side of the game with equal facility 
this switchability of roles is true of all games players may habitually prefer one role to another 
but they are capable of trading and they are willing to play any other role in the same game if for 
some reason that is indicated compare for example the switch from drinker to rescuer in the 
game of alcoholic 
second in clinical practice it is found that people who favor ydyb belong to that class of patients 
who eventually request hypnosis or some sort of hypnotic injection as a method of speeding up 
their treatment when they are playing the game their object is to demonstrate that no one can give 
them an acceptable suggestionthat is they will never surrender whereas with the therapist they 
request a procedure which will put them in a state of complete surrender it is thus apparent that 
ydyb represents a social solution to a conflict about surrender 
even more specifically this game is common among people who have a fear of blushing as die 
following therapeutic exchange demonstrates 
therapist why do you play why do not youyes but if you know its a con 
white if i am talking to somebody i have to keep thinking of things to say if i do not ill blush 
except in the dark i cannot stand a lull i know it and my husband knows it too hes always told 
me that 
therapist you mean if your adult does not keep busy your child takes the chance to pop up and 
make you feel embarrassed 
white that is it so if i can keep making suggestions to somebody or get him to make suggestions 
to me then i am all right i am protected as long as i can keep my adult in control i can postpone 
the embarrassment 
here white indicates clearly that she fears unstructured time her child is prevented from 
advertising as long as the adult can be kept busy in a social situation and a game offers a suitable 
structure for adult functioning but the game must be suitably motivated in order to maintain her 
interest her choice of ydyb is influenced by the principle of economy it yields die maximum 
internal and external advantages to her childs conflicts about physical passivity she could play 
with equal zest either die shrewd child who cannot be dominated or the sage parent who tries to 
dominate the child in someone else but fails since the basic principle of ydyb is that no 
suggestion is ever accepted the parent is never successful the motto of the game is do not get 
panicky the parent never succeeds 
in summary then while each move is amusing so to speak to white and brings its own little 
pleasure in rejecting the suggestion the real payoff is the silence or masked silence which ensues 
when all the others have racked their brains and grown tired of trying to think of acceptable 
solutions this signifies to white and to them that she has won by demonstrating it is they who are 
inadequate if the silence is not masked it may persist for several minutes in the paradigm green 
cut whites triumph short because of her eagerness to start a game of her own and that was what 

51

 
kept her from participating in whites game later on in the session white demonstrated her 
resentment against green for having abridged her moment of victory 
another curious feature of ydyb is that the external and internal games are played exactly the 
same way with die roles reversed in the external form the one observed clinically whites child 
comes out to play the role of the inadequate helpseeker in a manyhanded situation in the 
internal form the more intimate twohanded game played at home with her husband her parent 
comes out as the wise efficient suggestiongiver this reversal is usually secondary however 
since during the courtship she plays the helpless child side and only after the honeymoon is over 
does her bossy parent begin to emerge into the open there may have been slips as the wedding 
approached but her fiance will overlook these in his eagerness to settle down with his carefully 
chosen bride if he does not overlook them the engagement may be called off for good reasons 
and white sadder but no wiser will resume her search for a suitable mate 
antithesis it is evident that those who respond to whites first move the presentation of her 
problem are playing a form of i am only trying to help you ithy in fact ydyb is the 
inverse of ithy in ithy there is one therapist and many clients in ydyb one client and many 
therapists the clinical antithesis to ydyb therefore is not to play ithy if the opening is of 
the form what do you do if    wydi a suggested response is that is a difficult problem 
what are you going to do about it if it is of the form x did not work out properly the response 
then should be that is too bad both of these are polite enough to leave white at a loss or at least 
to elicit a crossed transaction so that his frustration becomes manifest and can then be explored in 
a therapy group it is good practice for susceptible patients to refrain from playing ithy when 
invited then not only white but the other members as well can learn from antiydyb which is 
merely the other side of antiithy 
in a social situation if the game is friendly and harmless there is no reason not to participate if it 
is an attempt to exploit professional knowledge an antithetical move may be required but in such 
situations this arouses resentment because of the exposure of whites child the best policy under 
those circumstances is to flee from the opening move and look for a stimulating game of first
degree rapo 
relatives why do not youyes but must be distinguished from its obverse why did you
no but ydnb in which it is the parent who wins and the defensive child who eventually 
retires in confusion although again the bare transcript may sound factual rational and adult to 
adult ydnb is closely related to furthermore 
the reverse of ydyb at first resembles peasant here white seduces the therapist into giving her 
suggestions which she immediately accepts rather than rejects only after he is deeply involved 
does he perceive that white is aiming on him what looked like peasant ends up as a game of 
intellectual rapo the classical version of this is the switch from positive to negative transference 
in the course of orthodox psychoanalysis 
ydyb may also be played in a seconddegree hard form as do me something the patient 
refuses to do the housework for example and there is a game of ydyb every evening when the 
husband returns home but no matter what he says she sullenly refuses to change her ways in 
some cases the sullenness may be malignant and require careful psychiatric evaluation the game 
aspect must be considered as well however since it raises the question of why the husband 
selected such a spouse and how he contributes to maintaining the situation

sexual games 
some games are played to exploit or fight off sexual impulses these are all in effect perversions 
of the sexual instincts in which the satisfaction is displaced from the sexual act to the crucial 
transactions which constitute die payoff of the game this cannot always be demonstrated 
convincingly because such games are usually played in privacy so that clinical information about 
them has to be obtained secondhand and the informants bias cannot always be satisfactorily 
evaluated the psychiatric conception of homosexuality for example is heavily skewed because 
the more aggressive and successful players do not often come for psychiatric treatment and die 
available material mostly concerns the passive partners 
the games included here are let us you and him fight perversion rapo stocking game 
and uproar in most cases the agent is a woman this is because the hard forms of sexual games 
in which the man is the agent verge on or constitute criminality and properly belong in the 
underworld section on the other side sexual games and marital games overlap but the ones 
described here are readily available to unmarried people as well as to spouses 

1 let us you and him fight  
thesis this may be a maneuver a ritual or a game in each case the psychology is essentially 
feminine because of its dramatic qualities lyahf is the basis of much of the worlds literature 
both good and bad 
1 as a maneuver it is romantic the woman maneuvers or challenges two men into fighting with 
the implication or promise that she will surrender herself to the winner 
after the competition is decided she fulfills her bargain this is an honest transaction and the 
presumption is that she and her mate live happily ever after 
2 as a ritual it tends to be tragic custom demands that the two men fight for her even if she does 
not want them to and even if she has already made her choice if the wrong man wins she must 
nevertheless take him in this case it is society and not the woman who sets up lyahf if she is 
willing the transaction is an honest one if she is unwilling or disappointed the outcome may offer 
her considerable scope for playing games such as let us pull a fast one on joey 
3 as a game it is comic the woman sets up the competition and while the two men are fighting 
she decamps with a third the internal and external psychological advantages for her and her mate 
are derived from the position that honest competition is for suckers and the comic story they have 
lived through forms the basis for the internal and external social advantages 

2 perversion 
thesis heterosexual perversions such as fetishism sadism and masochism are symptomatic of a 
confused child and are treated accordingly their transactional aspects however as manifested m 
actual sexual situations can be dealt with by means of game analysis this may lead to social 
control so that even if the warped sexual impulses remain unchanged they are neutralized as far as 
actual indulgence is concerned 
people who are suffering from mild sadistic or masochistic distortions tend to take a primitive kind 
of mental health position they feel that they are strongly sexed and that prolonged abstinence 
will lead to serious consequences neither of these conclusions is necessarily true but they form 
the basis for a game of wooden leg with the plea what do you expect from someone as 
strongly sexed as i am 
antithesis to extend ordinary courtesy to oneself and ones partner dial is to refrain from verbal 
or physical flagellation and confine oneself to more conventional forms of coitus if white is a true 
pervert this will lay bare the second element of the game which is often clearly expressed in his 
dreams that coitus itself has little interest for him and that his real satisfaction is derived from the 

54

 
 
 
humiliating foreplay this is something that he may not have cared to admit to himself but it will 
now become clear to him that his complaint is after all this work i have to have intercourse 
yet at this point the position is much more favorable for specific psychotherapy and much of the 
pleading and evasiveness has been nullified this applies to ordinary sexual psychopaths as seen 
in practice and not to malignant schizophrenic or criminal perversions nor to those who confine 
their sexual activities to fantasy 
the game of homosexuality has become elaborated into a subculture in many countries just as it 
is ritualized in others many of the disabilities which result from homosexuality arise from making 
it into a game the provocative behavior which gives rise to cops and robbers why does this 
always happen to us its the society we live in ah great men were and so forth is often 
amenable to social control which reduces the handicaps to a minimum the professional 
homosexual wastes a large amount of time and energy which could be applied to other ends 
analysis of his games may help him establish a quiet manage which will leave him free to enjoy 
the benefits that bourgeois society offers instead of devoting himself to playing his own variation 
of are not it awful 

3 rapo 
thesis this is a game played between a man and a woman which might more politely be called in 
the milder forms at least kiss off or indignation it may be played with varying degrees of 
intensity 
1 firstdegree rapo or kiss off is popular at social gatherings and consists essentially of 
mild flirtation white signals that she is available and gets her pleasure from the mans pursuit as 
soon as he has committed himself the game is over if she is polite she may say quite frankly i 
appreciate your compliments and thank you very much and move on to the next conquest if she 
is less generous she may simply leave him a skillful player can make this game last for a long 
time at a large social gathering by moving around frequently so that the man has to carry out 
complicated maneuvers in order to follow her without being too obvious 
2 in seconddegree rapo or indignation white gets only secondary satisfaction from blacks 
advances her primary gratification comes from rejecting him so that this game is also colloquially 
known as buzz off buster she leads black into a much more serious commitment than the mild 
flirtation of firstdegree rapo and enjoys watching his discomfiture when she repulses him 
black of course is not as helpless as he seems and may have gone to considerable trouble to get 
himself involved usually he is playing some variation of kick me 
3 thirddegree rapo is a vicious game which ends in murder suicide or the courtroom here 
white leads black into compromising physical contact and then claims that he has made a criminal 
assault or has done her irreparable damage in its most cynical form white may actually allow him 
to complete the sexual act so that she gets that enjoyment before confronting him the 
confrontation may be immediate as in the illegitimate cry of rape or it may be long delayed as in 
suicide or homicide following a prolonged love affair if she chooses to play it as a criminal assault 
she may have no difficulty in finding mercenary or morbidly interested allies such as the press the 
police counselors and relatives sometimes however these outsiders may cynically turn on her so 
that she loses the initiative and becomes a tool in their games 
in some cases outsiders perform a different function 
they force the game on an unwilling white because they want to play let us you and him fight 
they put her in such a position that in order to save her face or her reputation she has to cry rape 
this is particularly apt to happen with girls under the legal age of consent they may be quite 
willing to continue a liaison but because it is discovered or made an issue of they feel constrained 
to turn the romance into a game of thirddegree rapo 
in one wellknown situation the wary joseph refused to be inveigled into a game of rapo 
whereupon potiphars wife made the classical switch into let us you and him fight an excellent 
example of the way a hard player reacts to antithesis and of the dangers that beset people who 

55

 
 
refuse to play games these two games are combined in the wellknown badger game in which 
the woman seduces black and then cries rape at which point her husband takes charge and abuses 
black for purposes of blackmail 
one of the most unfortunate and acute forms of thirddegree rapo occurs relatively frequently 
between homosexual strangers who in a matter of an hour or so may bring the game to a point of 
homicide the cynical and criminal variations of this game contribute a large volume to sensational 
newspaper copy 
the childhood prototype of rapo is the same as that of frigid woman in which the little girl 
induces the boy to humiliate himself or get dirty and then sneers at him as classically described by 
maugham in of hitman bondage and as already noted by dickens in great expectations this is 
second degree a harder form approaching third degree may be played in tough neighborhoods 
antithesis the mans ability to avoid becoming involved in this game or to keep it under control 
depends on his capacity to distinguish genuine expressions of feeling from moves in the game if he 
is thus able to exert social control he may obtain a great deal of pleasure from the mild flirtations 
of kiss off on the other hand it is difficult to conceive of a safe antithesis for the potiphars 
wife maneuver other than checking out before closing time with no forwarding address in 1938 
the writer met an aging joseph in aleppo who had checked out of constantinople thirtytwo years 
previously after one of the sultans ladies had cornered him during a business visit to the yildiz 
harem he had to abandon his shop but took time to pick up his hoard of gold francs and had 
never returned 
relatives the male versions of rapo are notoriously found in commercial situations casting 
couch and then she did not get the part and cuddle up and then she got fired

4 the stocking game 
thesis this is a game of the rapo family in it the most obvious characteristic is the 
exhibitionism which is hysterical in nature a woman comes into a strange group and after a very 
short time raises her leg exposing herself in a provocative way and remarks oh my i have a run 
in my stocking this is calculated to arouse the men sexually and to make the other women angry 
any confrontation of white is met of course with protestations of innocence or counter
accusations hence the resemblance to classical rapo what is significant is whites lack of 
adaptation she seldom waits to find out what kind of people she is dealing with or how to time her 

56

 
 
 
maneuver hence it stands out as inappropriate and affects her relationships with her associates in 
spite of some superficial sophistication she fails to understand what happens to her in life 
because her judgment of human nature is too cynical the aim is to prove that other people have 
lascivious minds and her adult is conned by her child and her parent usually a lascivious mother 
into ignoring both her own provocativeness and the good sense of many of the people she meets 
thus the game tends to be selfdestructive 
this is probably a phallic variant of a game whose content depends on the underlying disturbance 
an oral variant may be exhibited by women with deeper pathology and welldeveloped breasts 
such women often sit with their hands behind their heads so as to thrust their breasts forward they 
may draw additional attention to them by remarking about their size or some pathology such as an 
operation or a lump some types of squirming probably constitute an anal variant the implication 
of this game is that the woman is sexually available thus it may be played in a more symbolic 
form by bereaved women who exhibit their widowhood insincerely 
antithesis along with the poor adaptation these women show little tolerance for antithesis if the 
game is ignored or countered by a sophisticated therapy group for example they may not return 
antithesis must be carefully distinguished in this game from reprisal since the latter signifies that 
white has won women are more skillful at countermoves in stocking game than men who 
indeed have little incentive to break up this game antithesis therefore is best left to the discretion 
of the other women present 

5 uproar 
thesis the classical game is played between domineering fathers and teenage daughters where 
there is a sexually inhibited mother father comes home from work and finds fault with daughter 
who answers impudently or daughter may make the first move by being impudent whereupon 
father finds fault their voices rise and the clash becomes more acute the outcome depends on 
who has the initiative there are three possibilities a father retires to his bedroom and slams the 
door b daughter retires to her bedroom and slams the door c both retire to their respective 
bedrooms and slam the doors in any case the end of a game of uproar is marked by a slamming 
door uproar offers a distressing but effective solution to the sexual problems that arise between 
fathers and teenage daughters in certain households often they can only live in the same house 
together if they are angry at each other and the slamming doors emphasize for each of them the 
fact that they have separate bedrooms 
in degenerate households this game may be played in a sinister and repellent form in which father 
waits up for daughter whenever she goes out on a date and examines her and her clodiing carefully 
on her return to make sure that she has not had intercourse the slightest suspicious circumstance 
may give rise to the most violent altercation which may end with the daughter being expelled from 
the house in the middle of the night in the long run nature will take its courseif not that night 
then the next or the one after then the fathers suspicions are justified as he makes plain to the 
mother who has stood by helplessly while all this went on 
in general however uproar may be played between any two people who are trying to avoid 
sexual intimacy for example it is a common terminal phase of frigid woman it is relatively 
rare between teenage boys and their female relatives because it is easier for teenage boys to 
escape from the house in the evening than for other members of the family at an earlier age 
brothers and sisters can set up effective barriers and partial satisfactions through physical combat a 
pattern which has various motivations at different ages and which in america is a semiritualistic 
form of uproar sanctioned by television pedagogic and pediatric authorities in upperclass 
england it is or was considered bad form and the corresponding energies are channeled into the 
wellregulated uproar of the playing fields 
antithesis the game is not as distasteful to the father as he might like to think and it is generally 
the daughter who makes the antithetical move through an early often premature or forced marriage 
if it is psychologically possible the mother can make the antithetical move by relinquishing her 

57

 
 
relative or absolute frigidity the game may subside if the father finds an outside sexual interest 
but that may lead to other complications in die case of married couples the antitheses are the same 
as for frigid woman or frigid man 
under appropriate circumstances uproar leads quite naturally into courtroom

chapter ten 
underworld games 
with the infiltration of the helping professions into the courts probation departments and 
correctional facilities and with the increasing sophistication o criminologists and law enforcement 
officers those concerned should be aware of the more common games prevalent in the underworld 
both in prison and out of it these include cops and robbers how do you get out of here 
and let us pull a fast one on joey 

1 cops and robbers 
thesis because many criminals are cophaters they seem to get as much satisfaction from 
outwitting the police as from their criminal gains often more their crimes at the adult level are 
games played for the material rewards the take but at the child level it is the thrill of the chase 
the getaway and the cooloff 
curiously enough the childhood prototype of cops and robbers is not cops and robbers but hide
andseek in which the essential element is the chagrin of being found younger children readily 
betray this if father finds them too easily the chagrin is there without much fun but father if he is 
a good player knows what to do he holds off whereupon the little boy gives him a clue by calling 
out dropping something or banging thus he forces father to find him but still shows chagrin this 
time he has had more fun because of the increased suspense if father gives up the boy usually 
feels disappointed rather than victorious since the fun of being hidden was there evidently that is 
not where the trouble lies what he is disappointed about is not being caught when his turn comes 
to hide father knows he is not supposed to outwit the little boy for very one just enough to make it 
fun and he is wise enough to look chagrined when he is caught it soon becomes clear that being 
found is the necessary payoff 
hence hideandseek is not a mere pastime but a true game at the social level it is a battle of wits 
and is most satisfying when the adult of each player does his best at the psychological level 
however it is set up like compulsive gambling in which whites adult has to lose in order for his 
child to win not being caught is actually the antithesis among older children one who finds an 
insoluble hiding place is regarded as not being a good sport since he has spoiled the game he has 
eliminated the child element and turned the whole thing into an adult procedure he is no longer 
playing for fun he is in the same class as the owner of a casino or some professional criminals 
who are really out for money rather than sport 
there seem to be two distinctive types of habitual criminals those who are in crime primarily for 
profit and those who are in it primarily for the gamewith a large group in between who can 
handle it either way the compulsive winner the big moneymaker whose child really does not 
want to be caught rarely is according to reports he is an untouchable for whom the fix is always 
in the compulsive loser on the other hand who is playing cops and robbers cr seldom 
does very well financially the exceptions to this often seem to be due to luck rather than skill in 
the long run even the lucky ones usually end up as their child requires squawking rather than 
riding high 
the cr player with whom we are concerned here in some ways resembles the alcoholic he 
can shift roles from robber to cop and from cop to robber in some cases he may play the 
parental cop during the day and the child robber after dark there is a cop in many robbers and 
a robber in many cops if the criminal reforms he may play the role of rescuer becoming a 
social worker or a mission worker but the rescuer is far less important in this game than in 
alcoholic ordinarily however the players role as robber is his destiny and each has his own 
modus operandi for getting caught he may make it tough or easy for the cops 
the situation is similar with gamblers at the social or sociological level a professional gambler 
is one whose chief interest in life is gambling but at the psychological level there are two different 
kinds of people who are professional gamblers there are those who spend their time gaming ie 

59

 
 
playing with fate in whom the strength of the adults desire to win is exceeded only by the 
strength of the childs need to lose then there are those who run gambling houses and actually do 
earn a living usually a very good one by providing opportunities for gamesters to play they 
themselves are not playing and try to avoid playing although occasionally under certain conditions 
they will indulge themselves and enjoy it just as a straight criminal may occasionally play a game 
of cr 
this throws light on why sociological and psychological studies of criminals have been generally 
ambiguous and unproductive they are dealing with two different kinds of people who cannot be 
adequately differentiated in the ordinary theoretical or empirical frameworks the same is true in 
studying gamblers transactional and game analyses offer an immediate solution for this they 
remove the ambiguity by distinguishing transactionally below the social level between players 
and straight professionals 
let us now turn from this general thesis to consider specific examples some burglars do their jobs 
without any waste motion the cops and robbers burglar leaves his calling card in gratuitous 
acts of vandalism such as spoiling valuable clothing with secretions and excretions the straight 
bank robber according to reports takes every possible precaution to avoid violence the cr bank 
robber is only looking for an excuse to vent his anger like any professional a straight criminal 
likes his jobs to be as clean as circumstances permit the cr criminal is compelled to blow off 
steam in the course of his work the true professional is said never to operate until the fix is in the 
player is willing to take on the law barehanded straight professionals are well aware in their own 
way of the game of cr if a gang member shows too much interest in the game to the point of 
jeopardizing the job and particularly if his need to be caught begins to show they will take drastic 
measures to prevent a recurrence perhaps it is just because straight professionals are not playing 
cr that they are so seldom caught and hence so rarely studied sociologically psychologically 
and psychiatrically and this also applies to gamblers hence most of our clinical knowledge about 
criminals and gamblers refers to players rather than to straight professionals 
kleptomaniacs as opposed to professional shoplifters are examples of how widely trivial cr is 
played it is probable that a very large percentage of occidentals at least have played cr in 
fantasy and that is what sells newspapers in our half of the world this fantasy frequently occurs in 
the form of dreaming up the perfect murder which is playing the hardest possible game and 
completely outwitting the cops 
variations of cr are auditors and robbers played by embezzlers with the same rules and the 
same payoff customs and robbers played by smugglers etc of special interest is the criminal 
variation of courtroom despite all his precautions the professional may occasionally be arrested 
and brought to trial for him courtroom is a procedure which he carries out according to the 
instructions of his legal advisers for the lawyers if they are compulsive winners courtroom is 
essentially a game played with the jury in which the object is to win not lose and this is regarded 
as a constructive game by a large segment of society 
antithesis this is the concern of qualified criminologists rather than psychiatrists the police and 
judiciary apparatus are not antithetical but are playing their roles in the game under the rules set up 
by society 
one thing should be emphasized however research workers in criminology may joke that some 
criminals behave as though they enjoyed the chase and wanted to be caught or they may read the 
idea and agree in a deferential way but they show little tendency to consider such an academic 
factor as decisive in their serious work for one thing there is no way to unmask this element 
through the standard methods of psychological research the investigator must therefore either 
overlook a crucial point because he cannot work it with his research tools or else change his tools 
the fact is that those tools have so far not yielded one single solution to any problem in 
criminology researchers might therefore be better off discarding the old methods and tackling the 
problem freshly until cr is accepted not merely as an interesting anomaly but as the very heart 
of the matter in a significant percentage of cases much research in criminology will continue to 
deal with trivialities doctrines peripheral issues or irrelevancies

2 how do you get out of here 
thesis the historical evidence is that those prisoners survive best who have their time structured 
by an activity a pastime or a game this is apparently well known to political police who are said 
to break some prisoners down simply by keeping them inactive and in a state of social deprivation 
the favored activity of solitary prisoners is reading or writing books and the favored pastime is 
escape some of whose practitioners such as casanova and baron trench have become famous 
the favored game is how do you get out of here1 want out which may also be played in 
state hospitals it must be distinguished from the operation see p 48 of the same name known as 
good behavior an inmate who really wants to be free will find out how to comply with the 
authorities so as to be released at the earliest possible moment nowadays this may often be 
accomplished by playing a good game of psychiatry group therapy type the game of want 
out however is played by inmates or by patients whose child does not want to get out they 
simulate good behavior but at the critical point they sabotage themselves so as not to be 
released thus in good behavior parent adult and child work together to be discharged in 
want out parent and adult go through the prescribed motions until the critical moment when the 
child who is actually frightened at the prospect of venturing into the uncertain world takes over 
and spoils the effect want out was common in the late 1930s among recently arrived 
immigrants from germany who became psychotic they would improve and beg for release from 
the hospital but as the day of liberation approached their psychotic manifestations would recur 
antithesis both good behavior and want out are recognized by alert administrators and can 
be dealt with at die executive level beginners in group therapy however are often taken in a 
competent group therapist knowing these are die most frequent manipulations in psychiatrically 
oriented prisons will be watching for them and will ferret them out at an early phase since good 
behavior is an honest operation it may be treated as such and there is no harm in discussing it 
openly want out on the other hand requires active therapy if the frightened inmate is to be 
rehabilitated 
relatives a close relative of want out is an operation called you have got to listen here the 
inmate of an institution or the client of a social agency demands the right to make complaints the 
complaints are often irrelevant his main purpose is to assure himself that he will be listened to by 
the authorities if they make the mistake of thinking that he expects the complaints to be acted on 
and cut him off as too demanding there may be trouble if they accede to his demands he will 
increase them if diey merely listen patiently and with signs of interest the got to listen player 
will be satisfied and cooperative and will not ask for anything more the administrator must learn 
to distinguish you have got to listen from serious demands for remedial action2 
bum rap is another game that belongs in this family a straight criminal may holler bum rap 
in a real effort to get out in which case it is part of the procedure the inmate who plays bum 

61

 
 
 
rap as a game however does not use it effectively to try to get out since if he gets out be will no 
longer have much excuse to holler 

3 let us pull a fast one on joey  
thesis the prototype of this game is the big store die bigtime confidence game but many 
small gifts and even the badger game are foojy no man can be beaten at foojy unless he has 
larceny in his veins because the first move is for black to tell white that dumbhonestoldjoey is 
just waiting to be taken if white were completely honest he would either back off or warn joey 
but he does not just as joey is about to pay off something goes wrong and white finds that his 
investment is gone or in the badger game just as joey is about to be cuckolded he happens to 
walk in then white who was playing his own rules in his own honest way finds that he has to 
play joeys rules and they hurt 
curiously enough the mark is supposed to know the rules of foojy and stick to them honest 
squawking is a calculated risk of the con mob they will not hold that against white and he is even 
allowed a certain latitude in lying to the police to save his face but if he goes too far and accuses 
them falsely of burglary for example that is cheating and they resent it on the other hand there is 
little sympathy for a con man who gets into trouble by working a mark who is drunk since this is 
improper procedure and be should know better the same applies if he is stupid enough to pick a 
mark with a sense of humor since it is well known that such people cannot be trusted to play the 
straight man in foojy all the way down the line through the terminal game of cops and 
robbers experienced con men are scared of marks who laugh after they have been taken 
it should be noted that a practical joke is not a game of foojy because in a practical joke joey is 
the one who suffers while in foojy joey comes out on top and white is the one who suffers a 
practical joke is a pastime while foojy is a game in which the joke is arranged to backfire 
it is evident that foojy is a three or fourhanded game with the police playing the fourth hand 
and that it is related to let us you and him fight

to end up in the chair he spends the rest of his life headed toward this goal and using his girl

chapter eleven 
consulting room games 

games that are tenaciously played in the therapeutic situation are the most important ones for the 
professional game analyst to be aware of they can be most readily studied firsthand in the 
consulting room there are three types according to the role of the agent 
1 games played by therapists and case workers i am only trying to help you and psychiatry 
2 games played by professionally trained people who ate patients in therapy groups such as 
greenhouse 
3 games played by lay patients and clients indigence peasant stupid and wooden leg 

1 greenhouse 
thesis this is a variation of psychiatry which is played hardest by young social scientists such 
as clinical psychologists in the company of their colleagues these young people tend to play 
psychoanalysis often in a jocular way using such expressions as your hostility is showing or 
how mechanical can a defense mechanism get this is usually a harmless and enjoyable pastime 
it is a normal phase of their learning experience and with a few originals in the group it can 
become quite amusing this writers preference is i see national parapraxis week is here again 
as patients in psychotherapy groups some of these people are apt to indulge in this mutual critique 
more seriously but since it is not highly productive in that situation it may have to be headed off 
by the therapist the proceedings may then turn into a game of greenhouse 
i here is a strong tendency for recent graduates to have an exaggerated respect for what they call 
genuine feelings the expression of such a feeling may be preceded by an announcement that it 
is on its way after the announcement the feeling is described or rather presented before die group 
as though it were a rare flower which should be regarded with awe the reactions of die other 
members are received very solemnly and they take on the air of connoisseurs at a botanical garden 
the problem seems to be in the jargon of game analysis whether this one is good enough to be 
exhibited in the national feeling show a questioning intervention by the therapist may be 
strongly resented as though be were some clumsyfingered clod mauling the fragile petals of an 
exotic century plant the therapist naturally feels that in order to understand the anatomy and 
physiology of a flower it may be necessary to dissect it 
antithesis the antithesis which is crucial for therapeutic progress is the irony of the above 
description if this game is allowed to proceed it may go on unchanged for years after which the 
patient may feel that he has had a therapeutic experience during which he has expressed 
hostility and learned to face feelings in a way which gives him an advantage over less fortunate 
colleagues meanwhile very little of dynamic significance may have happened and certainly the 
investment of time has not been used to maximum therapeutic advantage 
the irony in the initial description is directed not against the patients but against their teachers and 
the cultural milieu which encourages such overfastidiousness if properly timed a skeptical remark 
may successfully divorce them from foppish parental influences and lead to a less selfconscious 
robustness in their transactions with each other instead of cultivating feelings in a kind of hothouse 
atmosphere they may just let them grow naturally to be plucked when they are ripe 
the most obvious advantage of this game is the external psychological since it avoids intimacy by 
setting up special conditions under which feelings may be expressed and special restrictions on the 
responses of those present 

2 i am only trying to help you  
thesis this game may be played in any professional situation and is not confined to 
psychotherapists and welfare workers however it is found most commonly and in its most florid 
form among social workers with a certain type of training the analysis of this game was clarified 

63

 
 
 
for the writer under curious circumstances all the players at a poker game had folded except two a 
research psychologist and a businessman the businessman who had a high hand bet the 
psychologist who had an unbeatable one raised the businessman looked puzzled whereupon the 
psychologist remarked facetiously do not be upset i am only trying to help you the businessman 
hesitated and finally put in his chips the psychologist showed the winning band whereupon the 
other threw down his cards in disgust the others present then felt free to laugh at the psychologists 
joke and the loser remarked ruefully you sure were helpful the psychologist cast a knowing 
glance at the writer implying that the joke had really been made at the expense of the psychiatric 
profession it was at that moment that the structure of this game became clear 
the worker or therapist of whatever profession gives some advice to a client or patient the 
patient returns and reports that the suggestion did not have the desired effect the worker shrugs off 
this failure with a feeling of resignation and tries again if be is more watchful he may detect at 
this point a twinge of frustration but he will try again anyway usually he feels little need to 
question his own motives because he knows that many of his similarly trained colleagues do the 
same thing and that he is following the correct procedure and will receive full support from his 
supervisors 
if he runs up against a hard player such as a hostile obsessional he will find it more and more 
difficult to avoid feeling inadequate then he is in trouble and the situation will slowly deteriorate 
in the worst case he may come up against an angry paranoid who will rush in one day in a rage 
crying look what you made me do then his frustration will come strongly to the fore in the 
spoken or unspoken thought but i was only trying to help you his bewilderment at the 
ingratitude may cause him considerable suffering indicating the complex motives underlying his 
own behavior this bewilderment is the payoff 
legitimate helpers should not be confused with people who play i am only trying to help you 
ithy i think we can do something about it i know what to do i was assigned to help you 
or my fee for helping you will be    are different from i am only trying to help you the first 
four in good faith represent adult offers to put professional qualifications at the disposal of the 
distressed patient or client ithy has an ulterior motive which is more important than professional 
skill in determining the outcome this motive is based on the position that people are ungrateful 
and disappointing the prospect of success is alarming to the parent of the professional and is an 
invitation to sabotage because success would threaten the position the ithy player needs to be 
reassured that help will not be accepted no matter how strenuously it is offered the client responds 
with look how hard i am trying or there is nothing you can do to help me more flexible 
players can compromise it is all right for people to accept help providing it takes diem a long time 
to do so hence therapists tend to feel apologetic for a quick result since they know that some of 
their colleagues at staff meetings will be critical at the opposite pole from hard ithy players 
such as are found among social workers are good lawyers who help their clients without personal 
involvement or sentimentality here craftsmanship takes the place of covert strenuousness 
some schools of social work seem to be primarily academies for the training of professional ithy 
players and it is not easy for their graduates to desist from playing it an example which may help 
to illustrate some of the foregoing points will be found in the description of the complementary 
game indigence 
ithy and its variants are easy to find in everyday life it is played by family friends and relatives 
eg i can get it for you wholesale and by adults who do community work with children it is 
a favorite among parents and the complementary game played by the offspring is usually look 
what you made me do socially it may be a variant of schlemiel in which the damage is done 
while being helpful rather than impulsively here the client is represented by a victim who may be 
playing why does this always happen to me or one of its variants 
antithesis there are several devices available for the professional to handle an invitation to play 
this game and his selection will depend on the state of the relationship between himself and the 
patient particularly on the attitude of the patients child 

64

 
1 the classical psychoanalytic antithesis is the most thoroughgoing and the most difficult for the 
patient to tolerate the invitation is completely ignored the patient then tries harder and harder 
eventually he falls into a state of despair manifested by anger or depression which is the 
characteristic sign that a game has been frustrated this situation may lead to a useful confrontation 
2 a more gentle but not prim confrontation may be attempted on the first invitation the therapist 
states that he is the patients therapist and not his manager 
3 an even more gentle procedure is to introduce the patient into a therapy group and let the other 
patients handle it 
4 with an acutely disturbed patient it may be necessary to play along during the initial phase 
these patients should be treated by a psychiatrist who being a medical man can prescribe both 
medications and some of the hygienic measures which are still valuable even in this day of 
tranquilizers in the treatment of such people if the physician prescribes a hygienic regimen which 
may include baths exercise rest periods and regular meals along with medication the patient 1 
carries out the regimen and feels better c2 carries out the regimen scrupulously and complains that 
it does not help 3 mentions casually that he forgot to carry out the instructions or that he has 
abandoned the regimen because it was not doing any good in the second and third case it is then up 
to the psychiatrist to decide whether the patient is amenable to game analysis at that point or 
whether some other form of treatment is indicated to prepare him for later psychotherapy the 
relationship between the adequacy of die regimen and the patients tendency to play games with it 
should be carefully evaluated by the psychiatrist before he decides how to proceed next 
for the patient on the other hand the antithesis is do not tell me what to do to help myself ill tell 
you what to do to help me if the therapist is known to be a schlemiel the correct antithesis for the 
patient to use is do not help me help him but serious players of i am only trying to help you 
are generally lacking in a sense of humor antithetical moves on the part of a patient are usually 
unfavorably received and may result in the therapists lifelong enmity in everyday life such moves 
should not be initiated unless one is prepared to carry them through ruthlessly and take the 
consequences for example spuming a relative who can get it for you wholesale may cause 
serious domestic complications

thesis the thesis of this game is best stated by henry miller in the colossus of maroussi the 
event must have taken place during the year when i was looking for a job without the slightest 
intention of taking one it reminded me that desperate as i thought myself to be i bad not even 
bothered to look through the columns of the want ads this game is one of the complements of 
i am only trying to help you ithy as it is played by social workers who earn their living by it 
indigence is played just as professionally by the client who earns his living in this manner the 
writers own experience with indigence is limited but the following account by one of his most 
accomplished students illustrates the nature of this game and its place in our society

miss black was a social worker in a welfare agency whose avowed purpose for which it received a 
government subsidy was the economic rehabilitation of indigentswhich in effect meant getting 
them to find and retain gainful employment the clients of this agency were continually making 
progress according to official reports but very few of them were actually rehabilitated this 
was understandable it was claimed because most of them had been welfare clients for several 
years going from agency to agency and sometimes being involved with five or s agencies at a 
time so that it was evident that they were difficult cases 
miss black from her training in game analysis soon realized that the staff of her agency was 
playing a consistent game of ithy and wondered how the clients were responding to this in order 
to check she asked her own clients from week to week how many job opportunities they had 
actually investigated she was interested to discover that although they were theoretically supposed 
to be looking assiduously for work from day to day actually they devoted very little effort to this 
and sometimes the token efforts they did make had an ironic quality for example one man said 
that he answered at least one advertisement a day looking for work what kind of work she 
inquired he said he wanted to go into sales work is that the only kind of ad you answer she 
asked he said that it was but it was too bad that he was a stutterer as that held him back from 
his chosen career about this time it came to the attention of her supervisor that she was asking 
these questions and she was reprimanded for putting undue pressure on her clients 
miss black decided nevertheless to go ahead and rehabilitate some of them she selected those who 
were ablebodied and did not seem to have a valid reason to continue to receive welfare funds 
with this selected group she talked over the games ithy and indigence when they were 
willing to concede the point she said that unless they found jobs she was going to cut them off 
from welfare funds and refer them to a different kind of agency several of them almost 
immediately found employment some for the first time in years but they were indignant at her 
attitude and some of them wrote letters to her supervisor complaining about it the supervisor 
called her in and reprimanded her even more severely on the ground that although her former 
clients were working they were not really rehabilitated the supervisor indicated that there was 
some question whether they would retain miss black in the agency miss black as much as she 
dared without further jeopardizing her position tactfully tried to elicit what would constitute really 
rehabilitated in the agencys opinion this was not clarified she was only told that she was 
putting undue pressure on people and the fact that they were supporting their families for the first 
time in years was in no way to her credit 
because she needed her job and was now in danger of losing it some of her friends tried to help 
the respected head of a psychiatric clinic wrote to the supervisor stating that he had heard miss 
black had done some particularly effective work with welfare clients and asking whether she 
might discuss her findings at a staff conference at his clinic the supervisor refused permission 
in this case the rules of indigence were set up by the agency to complement the local rules of 
ithy there was a tacit agreement between the worker and the client which read as follows 
w ill try to help you providing you do not get better b ill look for employment providing i 
do not have to find any 
if a client broke the agreement by getting better the agency lost a client and the client lost his 
welfare benefits and both felt penalized if a worker like miss black broke the agreement by 
making the client actually find work the agency was penalized by the clients complaints which 
might come to the attention of higher authorities while again the client lost his welfare benefits 
as long as both obeyed the implicit rules both got what they wanted the client received his 
benefits and soon learned what the agency wanted in return an opportunity to reach out as part 
of ithy plus clinical material to present at clientcentered staff conferences 
the client was glad to comply with these demands which gave him as much pleasure as it did the 
agency thus they got along well together and neither felt any desire to terminate such a satisfying 
relationship miss black in effect reached in instead of reaching out and proposed a 
communitycentered staff conference instead of a clientcentered one and this disturbed all the 

66

 
others concerned in spite of the fact that she was thus only complying with the stated intent of the 
regulations 
two things should be noted here first indigence as a game rather than a condition due to 
physical mental or economic disability is played by only a limited percentage of welfare clients 
second it will only be supported by social workers who are trained to play ithy it will not be 
welltolerated by other workers 
allied games are veteran and clinic veteran displays the same symbiotic relationship this 
time between the veterans administration allied organizations and a certain number of 
professional veterans who share die legitimate privileges of disabled exservicemen clinic is 
played by a certain percentage of those who attend the outpatient departments of large hospitals 
unlike those who play indigent or veteran patients who play clinic do not receive financial 
remuneration but get other advantages they serve a useful social purpose since they are willing to 
cooperate in the training of medical personnel and in studies of disease processes from this they 
may get a legitimate adult satisfaction not available to players of indigence and veteran 
antithesis antithesis if indicated consists in withholding the benefits here the risk is not 
primarily from the player himself as in most other games but from this game being culturally 
syntonic and fostered by the complementary ithy players the threat comes from professional 
colleagues and the aroused public government agencies and protective unions the complaints 
which follow an exhibition of antiindigence may lead to a loud outcry of yes yes how about 
that which may be regarded as a healthy constructive operation or pastime even if it 
occasionally discourages candidness in fact the whole american political system of democratic 
freedoms is based on a license not available under many other forms of government to ask that 
question without such a license humanitarian social progress becomes seriously impeded 

4 peasant 
thesis the prototype peasant is the arthritic bulgarian villager who sells her only cow to raise 
money to go to the university clinic in sofia there the professor examines her and finds her case 
so interesting that he presents her in a clinical demonstration to the medical students he outlines 
not only the pathology symptoms and diagnosis but also the treatment this procedure fills her 
with awe before she leaves the professor gives her a prescription and explains the treatment in 
more detail she is overcome with admiration for his learning and says the bulgarian equivalent of 
gee you are wonderful professor however she never has the prescription filled first there is 
no apothecary in her village second even if there were she would never let such a valuable piece 
of paper out of her hands nor does she have the facilities for carrying out the rest of the treatment 
such as diet hydrotherapy and so on she lives on crippled as before but happy now because she 
can tell everyone about the wonderful treatment prescribed for her by the great professor in sofia 
to whom she expresses her gratitude every night in her prayers 
years later the professor in an unhappy frame of mind happens to pass through the village on his 
way to see a wealthy but demanding patient he remembers the peasant when she rushes out to kiss 
his hand and remind him of the marvelous regimen he put her on so long ago he accepts her 
homage graciously and is particularly gratified when she tells him how much good the treatment 
has done in fact he is so carried away that he fails to notice that she limps as badly as ever 
socially peasant is played in an innocent and a dissembled form both with the motto gee 
you are wonderful mr murgatroyd gywm in the innocent form murgatroyd is wonderful he 
is a celebrated poet painter philanthropist or scientist and naive young women frequently travel a 
long way in the hope of meeting him so that they can sit adoringly at his feet and romanticize his 
imperfections a more sophisticated woman who sets out deliberately to have an affair or a 
marriage with such a man whom she sincerely admires and appreciates may be fully aware of his 
weaknesses she may even exploit them in order to get what she wants with these two types of 
women the game arises from the romanticizing or exploiting of the imperfections while the 

67

 
 
innocence lies in their genuine respect for his accomplishments which they are able to evaluate 
correctly 
in the dissembled form murgatroyd may or may not be wonderful but he comes up against a 
woman incapable of appreciating him in the best sense in any case perhaps she is a highclass 
prostitute she plays little old me and uses gywm as sheer flattery to attain her own ends 
underneath she is either bewildered by him or laughing at him but she does not care about him 
what she wants are the perquisites that go with him 
clinically peasant is played in two similar forms with the motto gee you are wonderful 
professor gywp in the innocent form the patient may stay well as long as she can believe in 
gywp which places an obligation on the therapist to be wellbehaved both in public and in private 
life in the dissembled form the patient hopes the therapist will go along with her gywp and think 
you are uncommonly perceptive yup once she has him in this position she can make him look 
foolish and then move on to another therapist if he cannot be so easily beguiled he may actually 
be able to help her 
the simplest way for the patient to win gywp is not to get better if she is more malicious she 
may take more positive steps to make the therapist look foolish one woman played gywp with 
her psychiatrist without any alleviation of symptoms she finally left him with many salaams and 
apologies she then went to her revered clergyman for help and played gywp with him after a 
few weeks she seduced him into a game of seconddegree rapo she then told her neighbor 
confidentially over the back fence how disappointed she was that so fine a man as rev black could 
in a moment of weakness make a pass at an innocent and unattractive women like herself 
knowing his wife she could forgive him of course but nevertheless etc this confidence just 
slipped out inadvertently and it was only afterward that she remembered to her horror that the 
neighbor was an elder in the church with her psychiatrist she won by not getting better with her 
clergyman she won by seducing him although she was reluctant to admit it but a second 
psychiatrist introduced her to a therapy group where she could not maneuver as she had before 
then with no gywp and yup to fill in her therapeutic time she began to examine her behavior 
more closely and with the help of the group was able to give up both her gamesgywp and 
rapo 
antithesis the therapist must first decide whether the game is played innocently and hence should 
be allowed to continue for the benefit of the patient until her adult is sufficiently wellestablished 
to risk countermeasures if it is not innocent the countermeasures may be taken at the first 
appropriate opportunity after the patient has been sufficiently well prepared so that she will be able 
to understand what happens the therapist then steadfastly refuses to give advice and when the 
patient begins to protest he makes it clear that this is not merely pokerfaced psychiatry but a 
wellthoughtout policy in due time his refusals may either enrage the patient or precipitate acute 
anxiety symptoms the next step depends on the malignancy of the patients condition if she is too 
upset her acute reactions should be dealt with by appropriate psychiatric or analytic procedures to 
reestablish the therapeutic situation the first goal in the dissembled form is to split off the adult 
from the hypocritical child so that the game can be analyzed 
in social situations intimate entanglements with innocent gywm players should be avoided as 
any intelligent actors agent will impress upon his clients on the other hand women who play 
dissembled gywm are sometimes interesting and intelligent if they can be degywmed and may 
turn out to be quite a delightful addition to the family social circle 

5 psychiatry 
thesis psychiatry as a procedure must be distinguished from psychiatry as a game according to 
the available evidence presented in proper clinical form in scientific publications the following 
approaches among others are of value in treating psychiatric conditions shock therapy hypnosis 
drugs psychoanalysis orthopsychiatry and group therapy there are others which are less 
commonly used and will not be discussed here any of these can be used in the game of 

68

 
 
psychiatry which is based on the position i am a healer supported by a diploma it says here i 
am a healer it will be noted that in any case this is a constructive benevolent position and that 
people who play psychiatry can do a great deal of good providing they are professionally trained 
it is likely however that there will be some gain in therapeutic results if therapeutic ardor is 
moderated the antithesis was best expressed long ago by ambroise par who said in effect i 
treat them but god cures them every medical student learns about this dictum along with others 
such as primium non nocere and phrases such as vis medicatrix naturae nonmedical therapists 
however are not likely to be exposed to these ancient cautions the position i am a healer 
because it says here that i am a healer is likely to be an impairment and may be replaced to 
advantage with something like i will apply what therapeutic procedures i have learned in the hope 
that they will be of some benefit this avoids the possibility of games based on since i am a 
healer if you do not get better its your fault eg i am only trying to help you or since you are 
a healer ill get better for you eg peasant all of this of course is known in principle to 
every conscientious therapist certainly every therapist who has ever presented a case at a reputable 
clinic has been made aware of it conversely a good clinic may be defined as one which makes its 
therapists aware of these things 
on the other side the game of psychiatry is more apt to crop up with patients who have 
previously been treated by less competent therapists a few patients for example carefully pick 
weak psychoanalysts moving from one to another demonstrating that they cannot be cured and 
meanwhile learning to play a sharper and sharper game of psychiatry eventually it becomes 
difficult for even a firstrate clinician to separate the wheat from the chaff the duplex transaction 
on the patients side is 
adult i am coming to be cured 
child you will never cure me but you will teach me to be a better neurotic play a better game of 
psychiatry 
mental health is played similarly here the adult statement is everything will get better if i 
apply the principles of mental health which i have read and heard about one patient learned to 
play psychiatry from one therapist mental health from another and then as a result of still 
another effort began to play a pretty good game of transactional analysis when this was frankly 
discussed with her she agreed to stop playing mental health but requested that she be allowed to 
continue to play psychiatry because it made her feel comfortable the transactional psychiatrist 
agreed she continued therefore for several months to recite her dreams and her interpretations of 
them at weekly intervals finally partly out of plain gratitude perhaps she decided that it might be 
interesting to find out what was really the matter with her she became seriously interested in 
transactional analysis with good results 
a variant of psychiatry is archaeology title by courtesy of dr norman reider of san 
francisco in which the patient takes the position that if she can only find out who had the button 
so to speak everything will suddenly be all right this results in a continual rumination over 
childhood happenings sometimes the therapist may he beguiled into a game of critique in 
which the patient describes her feelings in various situations and the therapist tells her what is 
wrong with them selfexpression which is a common game in some therapy groups is based on 
the dogma feelings are good a patient who uses vulgar expletives for example may be 
applauded or at least implicitly lauded a sophisticated group however will soon spot this as a 
game 
some members of therapy groups become quite adept at picking out games of psychiatry and 
will soon let a new patient know if they think he is playing psychiatry or transactional 
analysis instead of using group procedures to obtain legitimate insight a woman who transferred 
from a selfexpression group in one city to a more sophisticated group in another city told a story 
about an incestuous relationship in her childhood instead of the awe which she had come to expect 
whenever she told this oftrepeated tale she was greeted with indifference whereupon she became 
enraged she was astonished to discover that the new group was more interested in her transactional 
anger than in her historical incest and in irate tones she hurled what apparently in her mind was the 

69

 
ultimate insult she accused them of not being freudian freud himself of course took 
psychoanalysis more seriously and avoided making a game of it by saying that he himself was not 
a freudian 
recently unmasked is a new variant of psychiatry called tell me this somewhat similar to the 
party pastime twenty questions white relates a dream or an incident and the other members 
often including die therapist then attempt to interpret it by asking pertinent questions as long as 
white answers the questions each member continues his inquiries until he finds a question white 
cannot answer then black sits back with a knowing look which says aha if you could answer 
that one you would certainly get better so i have done my part this is a distant relative of why 
do not youyes but some therapy groups are based almost entirely on this game and may go 
on for years with only minimal change or progress tell me this allows much latitude to white 
the patient who for example can play along with it by feeling ineffectual or he can counter it by 
answering all the questions offered in which case the anger and dismay of the other players soon 
becomes manifest since he is throwing back at them i have answered all your questions and you 
have not cured me so what does that make you tell me this is also played in schoolrooms 
where the pupils know that the right answer to an openended question asked by a certain type of 
teacher is not to be found by processing the factual data but by guessing or outguessing which of 
several possible answers will make the teacher happy a pedantic variant occurs in teaching ancient 
greek the teacher always has the upper hand over the pupil and can make him look stupid and 
prove it in print by pointing to some obscure feature of the text this is also often played in 
teaching hebrew 

6 stupid 
thesis in its milder form the thesis of stupid is i laugh with you at my own clumsiness and 
stupidity seriously disturbed people however may play it in a sullen way which says i am 
stupid that is the way i am so do me something both forms are played from a depressive position 
stupid must be distinguished from schlemiel where the position is more aggressive and the 
clumsiness is a bid for forgiveness it must also be distinguished from clown which is not a 
game but a pastime which reinforces the position i am cute and harmless the critical transaction 
in stupid is for white to make black call him stupid or respond as though he were stupid hence 
white acts like a schlemiel but does not ask for forgiveness in fact forgiveness makes him uneasy 
because it threatens his position or he behaves clownishly but with no implication that he is 
kidding he wants his behavior to be taken seriously as evidence of real stupidity there is 
considerable external gain since the less white learns the more effectively he can play hence at 
school he need not study and at work he need not go out of his way to learn anything that might 
lead to advancement he has known from an early age that everyone will be satisfied with him as 
long as he is stupid despite any expressions to the contrary people are surprised when in time of 
stress if he decides to come through it turns out that he is not stupid at allany more than is the 
stupid younger son in the fairy tale 
antithesis the antithesis of the milder form is simple by not playing by not laughing at the 
clumsiness or railing at the stupidity the antistupid player will make a friend for life one of the 
subtleties is that this game is often played by cyclothymic or manicdepressive personalities when 
such people are euphoric it seems as though they really want their associates to join in their 
laughter at themselves it is often hard not to for they give the impression that they will resent an 
abstainerwhich in a way they do since he threatens their position and spoils the game but when 
they are depressed and their resentment against those who laughed with or at them comes into the 
open the abstainer knows that he has acted correctly he may be the only one the patient is willing 
to have in the room or talk to when he is withdrawn and all the former friends who enjoyed the 
game are now treated as enemies 
it is no use telling white that he is not really stupid he may actually be of quite limited 
intelligence and well aware of it which is how the game got started in the first place there may be 

70

 
 
special areas however in which he is superior often psychological insight is one it does no harm 
to show whatever respect is deserved for such aptitudes but this is different from clumsy attempts 
at reassurance the latter may give him the bitter satisfaction of realizing that other people are 
even more stupid than he but this is small consolation such reassurance is certainly not the most 
intelligent therapeutic procedure usually it is a move in a game of i am only trying to help you 
the antithesis of stupid is not to substitute another game but simply to refrain from playing 
stupid 
the antithesis of the sullen form is a more complicated problem because the sullen player is trying 
to provoke not laughter or derision but helplessness or exasperation which he is well equipped to 
handle in accordance with his challenge so do me something thus he wins either way if black 
does nothing it is because he feels helpless and if he does something it is because he is 
exasperated hence these people are prone also to play why do not youyes but from which 
they can get the same satisfactions in milder form there is no easy solution in this case nor is 
there likely to be one forthcoming until the psychodynamics of this game are more clearly 
understood 

7 wooden leg 
thesis the most dramatic form of wooden leg is the plea of insanity this may be translated 
into transactional terms as follows what do you expect of someone as emotionally disturbed as i 
amthat i would refrain from killing people to which the jury is asked to reply certainly not 
we would hardly impose that restriction on you the plea of insanity played as a legal game is 
acceptable to american culture and is different from the almost universally respected principle that 
an individual may be suffering from a psychosis so profound that no reasonable person would 
expect him to be responsible for his actions in japan drunkenness and in russia wartime military 
service are accepted as excuses for evading responsibility for all kinds of outrageous behavior 
according to this writers information 
the thesis of wooden leg is what do you expect of a man with a wooden leg put that way 
of course no one would expect anything of a man with a wooden leg except that he should steer his 
own wheel chair on the other hand during world war ii there was a man with a wooden leg who 
used to give demonstrations of jitterbug dancing and very competent jitterbug dancing at army 
hospital amputation centers there are blind men who practice law and hold political offices one 
such is currently mayor of the writers home town deaf men who practice psychiatry and handless 
men who can use a typewriter 
as long as someone with a real exaggerated or even imaginary disability is content with his lot 
perhaps no one should interfere but the moment he presents himself for psychiatric treatment the 
question arises if he is using his life to his own best advantage and if he can rise above his 
disability in this country the therapist will be working in opposition to a large mass of educated 
public opinion even the close relatives of the patient who complained most loudly about the 
inconveniences caused by his infirmity may eventually rum on the therapist if the patient makes 
definitive progress this is readily understandable to a game analyst but it makes his task no less 
difficult all the people who were playing i am only trying to help you are threatened by the 
impending disruption of the game if the patient shows signs of striking out on his own and 
sometimes they use almost incredible measures to terminate the treatment 
both sides are illustrated by the case of the stuttering client of miss blacks mentioned in the 
discussion of the game indigence this man played a classical form of wooden leg he was 
unable to find employment which he correctly attributed to the fact that he was a stutterer since 
the only career that interested him he said was that of salesman as a free citizen he had a right to 
seek employment in whatever field he chose but as a stutterer his choice raised some question as 
to the purity of his motives the reaction of the helpful agency when miss black attempted to break 
up this game was very unfavorable to her 

71

 
 
wooden leg is especially pernicious in clinical practice because the patient may find a therapist 
who plays the same game with the same plea so that progress is impossible this is relatively easy 
to arrange in the case of the ideological plea what do you expect of a man who lives in a 
society like ours one patient combined this with the psychosomatic plea what do you expect 
of a man with psychosomatic symptoms he found a succession of therapists who would accept 
one plea but not the other so that none of them either made him feel comfortable in his current 
position by accepting both pleas or budged him from it by rejecting both thus he proved that 
psychiatry could not help people 
some of the pleas which patients use to excuse symptomatic behavior are colds head injuries 
situational stress the stress of modem living american culture and the economic system a literate 
player has no difficulty in finding authorities to support him i drink because i am irish this 
would not happen if i lived in russia or tahiti the fact is that patients in mental hospitals in russia 
and tahiti are very similar to those in american state hospitals1 special pleas of if it were not for 
them or they let me down should always be evaluated very carefully in clinical practiceand 
also in social research projects 
slightly more sophisticated are such pleas as what do you expect of a man who a comes from a 
broken home b is neurotic c is in analysis or d is suffering from a disease known as alcoholism 
these are topped by if i stop doing this i will not be able to analyze it and then ill never get better 
the obverse of wooden leg is rickshaw with the thesis if they only had rickshaws 
duckbill platypuses girls who spoke ancient egyptian around this town i never would have got 
into this mess 
antithesis antiwooden leg is not difficult if the therapist can distinguish clearly between his 
own parent and adult and if the therapeutic aim is explicitly understood 
by both parties 
on the parental side he can be either a good parent or a harsh one as a good parent he can 
accept the patients plea especially if it fits in with his own viewpoints perhaps with the 
rationalization that people are not responsible for their actions until they have completed their 
therapy as a harsh parent he can reject the plea and engage in a contest of wills with the patient 
both of these attitudes are already familiar to the wooden leg player and he knows how to 
extract the maximum satisfactions from each of them 
as an adult the therapist declines both of these opportunities when the patient asks what do 
you expect of a neurotic or whatever plea he is using at the moment the reply is i do not expect 
anything the question is what do you expect of yourself the only demand he makes is that the 
patient give a serious answer to this question and the only concession he makes is to allow the 
patient a reasonable length of time to answer it anywhere from six weeks to six months depending 
on the relationship between them and the patients previous preparation

chapter twelve 
good games 
the psychiatrist who is in the best and perhaps the only position to study games adequately 
unfortunately deals almost entirely with people whose games have led them into difficulties this 
means that die games which are offered for clinical investigation are all in some sense bad ones 
and since by definition games are based on ulterior transactions they must all have some element 
of exploitation for these two reasons practical on the one hand and theoretical on the other the 
search for good games becomes a difficult quest a good game might be described as one 
whose social contribution outweighs the complexity of its motivations particularly if the player has 
come to terms with those motivations without futility or cynicism that is a good game would be 
one which contributes both to the wellbeing of the other players and to the unfolding of the one 
who is it since even under the best forms of social action and organization a large proportion of 
time has to be spent in playing games the search for good ones must be assiduously pursued 
several examples are offered here but they are admittedly deficient in both number and quality 
they include busmans holiday cavalier happy to help homely sage and they will be 
glad they knew me 

1 busmans holiday 
thesis strictly speaking this is a pastime rather than a game and evidently a constructive one for 
all concerned an american mail carrier goes to tokyo to help a japanese postman on his rounds 
or an american earnoseandthroat specialist who spends his holiday working in a haitian hospital 
will very likely feel just as refreshed and have just as good stories to tell as if he had gone hunting 
in africa or spent the time driving through transcontinental highway traffic the peace corps has 
now given official sanction to busmans holiday 
busmans holiday becomes a game however if the work is secondary to some ulterior motive 
and is undertaken merely as a show in order to accomplish something else even under those 
circumstances however it still keeps its constructive quality and is one of the more commendable 
covers for other activities which may also be constructive 

2 cavalier 
thesis this is a game played by men who are not under sexual pressureoccasionally by younger 
men who have a satisfactory marriage or liaison more often by older men who are gracefully 
resigned to monogamy or celibacy upon encountering a suitable female subject white takes every 
opportunity to remark upon her good qualities never transgressing the limits appropriate to her 
station in life the immediate social situation and the requirements of good taste but within those 
limits he allows full play to his creativity enthusiasm and originality the object is not to seduce 
but to exhibit his virtuosity in the art of effective compliment the internal social advantage lies in 
the pleasure given to the woman by this innocent artistry and by her responsive appreciation of 
whites skill in suitable cases where both are aware of the nature of the game it may be stretched 
with increasing delight on both sides to the point of extravagance a man of the world of course 
will know when to stop and will not continue beyond the point at which he ceases to amuse out of 
consideration for her or where the quality of his offerings begins to deteriorate out of 
consideration for his own pride of craftsmanship cavalier is played for its external social 
advantages in the case of poets who are as much or more interested in the appreciation of 
qualified critics and the public at large as they are in the response of the lady who inspired them 
the europeans in romance and the british in poetry seem always to have been more adept at this 
game than the americans in our country it has fallen largely into the hands of the fruit stand 
school of poetry your eyes are like avocados your lips like cucumbers etc cavalier fruit stand 

73

 
 
 
type can hardly compare in elegance with the productions of herrick and lovelace or even with 
the cynical but imaginative works of rochester roscommon and 
dorset 
antithesis it takes some sophistication for the woman to play her part well and a great deal of 
sulkiness or stupidity for her to refuse to play it at all the proper complement is a variant of gee 
you are wonderful mr murgatroyd gywm namely i admire your productions mr m if 
the woman is mechanical or unperceptive she may respond with plain gywm but that misses the 
point what white is offering for appreciation is not himself but his poetry the brutal antithesis 
from a sulky woman is to play seconddegree rapo buzz off buster thirddegree rapo 
which could conceivably occur would of course be an unspeakably vile response under the 
circumstances if the woman is merely stupid she will play firstdegree rapo taking the 
compliments to feed her vanity and neglecting to appreciate whites creative efforts and abilities in 
general the game is spoiled if the woman treats it as an attempt at seduction rather than as a literary 
exhibition 
relatives cavalier being a game it must be distinguished from the operations and procedures 
carried on during a straightforward courtship which are simple transactions without ulterior motive 
the female counterpart of cavalier may be conveniently called blarney since it is often played 
by gallant irish ladies in their sunset years

3 happy to help 
thesis white is consistently helpful to other people with some ulterior motive he may be doing 
penance for past wickedness covering up for present wickedness making friends in order to 
exploit them later or seeking prestige but whoever questions his motives must also give him credit 
for his actions after all people can cover up for past wickedness by becoming more wicked 
exploit people by fear rather than generosity and seek prestige for evil ways instead of good ones 
some philanthropists are more interested in competition than in benevolence i gave more money 
works of art acres of land than you did again if their motives are questioned they must 
nevertheless be given credit for competing in a constructive way since there are so many people 
who compete destructively most people or peoples who play happy to help have both friends 
and enemies both perhaps justified in their feelings their enemies attack their motives and 
minimize their actions while their friends are grateful for their actions and minimize their motives 
therefore socalled objective discussions of this game are practically nonexistent people who 
claim to be neutral soon show which side they are neutral on 
this game as an exploitative maneuver is the basis for a large proportion of public relations in 
america but the customers are glad to become involved and it is perhaps the most pleasant and 
constructive of the commercial games in another connection one of its most reprehensible forms is 
a threehanded family game in which the mother and father compete for the affection of their 
offspring but even here it should be noted the choice of happy to help removes some of the 

74

 
 
 
discredit since there are so many unpleasant ways of competing availablefor example mommy 
is sicker than daddy or why do you love him more than you love me 

4 homely sage 
thesis this is properly a script rather than a game but it has gamelike aspects a welleducated 
and sophisticated man learns as much as he can about all sorts of things besides his own business 
when he reaches retirement age he moves from the big city where he held a responsible position to 
a small town there it soon becomes known that people can go to him with their problems of 
whatever kind from a knock in the engine to a senile relative and that he will help them himself if 
he is competent or else refer them to qualified experts thus he soon finds his place in his new 
environment as a homely sage making no pretenses hut always willing to listen in its best form 
it is played by people who have taken the trouble to go to a psychiatrist to examine their motives 
and to learn what errors to avoid before setting themselves up in this role 

5 they will be glad they knew me  
thesis this is a more worthy variant of ill show them there are two forms of ill show 
them in the destructive form white shows them by inflicting damage on them thui he may 
maneuver himself into a superior position not for the prestige or the material rewards hut because 
it gives him power to exercise his spite in the constructive form white works hard and exerts every 
effort to gain prestige not for the sake of craftsmanship or legitimate accomplishment although 
those may play a secondary role nor to inflict direct damage on his enemies but so that they will 
be eaten with envy and with regret for not having treated him better 
in they will be glad they knew me white is working not against but for the interests of his 
former associates he wants to show them that they were justified in treating him with friendliness 
and respect and to demonstrate to them for their own gratification that their judgment was sound 
in order for him to have a secure win in this game his means as well as his ends must be honorable 
and that is its superiority over ill show them both ill show them and they will be glad can 
be merely secondary advantages of success rather than games they become games when white is 
more interested in the effects on his enemies or friends than he is in the success itself

part iii beyond games 

chapter thirteen 
the significance of games 
1 games are passed on from generation to generation the favored game of any individual can be 
traced back to his parents and grandparents and forward to his children they in turn unless there is 
a successful intervention will teach them to his grandchildren thus game analysis takes place in a 
grand historical matrix demonstrably extending back as far as one hundred years and reliably 
projected into the future for at least fifty years breaking this chain which involves five or more 
generations may have geometrically progressive effects there are many living individuals who 
have more than 200 descendants games may be diluted or altered from one generation to another 
hut there seems to be a strong tendency to inbreed with people who play a game of the same family 
if not of the same genus that is the historical significance of games 
2 raising children is primarily a matter of teaching them what games to play different cultures 
and different social classes favor different types of games and various tribes and families favor 
different variations of these that is the cultural significance of games 
3 games are sandwiched as it were between pastimes and intimacy pastimes grow boring with 
repetition as do promotional cocktail parties intimacy requires stringent circumspection and is 
discriminated against by parent adult and child society frowns upon candidness except in 
privacy good sense knows that it can always be abused and the child fears it because of the 
unmasking which it involves hence in order to get away from the ennui of pastimes without 
exposing themselves to the dangers of intimacy most people compromise for games when they are 
available and these fill the major part of the more interesting hours of social intercourse that is 
the social significance of games 
4 people pick as friends associates and intimates other people who play the same games hence 
everybody who is anybody in a given social circle aristocracy juvenile gang social club college 
campus etc behaves in a way which nay seem quite foreign to members of a different social 
circle conversely any member of a social circle who changes his games will tend to be extruded 
but he will find himself welcome at some other social circle that is the personal significance of 
games 

note 
the reader should now be in a position to appreciate the basic difference between mathematical and 
transactional game analysis mathematical game analysis postulates players who are completely 
rational transactional game analysis deals with games which are unrational or even irrational 
and hence more real 

chapter fourteen 
the players 
many games are played most intensely by disturbed people generally speaking the more 
disturbed they are the harder they play curiously enough however some schizophrenics seem to 
refuse to play games and demand candidness from the beginning in everyday life games are 
played with the greatest conviction by two classes of individuals the sulks and the jerks or squares 
the sulk is a man who is angry at his mother on investigation it emerges that he has been angry at 
her since early childhood he often has good child reasons for his anger she may have 
deserted him during a critical period in his boyhood by getting sick and going to the hospital or 
she may have given birth to too many siblings sometimes the desertion is more deliberate she 
may have farmed him out in order to remarry in any case he has been sulking ever since he does 
not like women although he may be a don juan since sulking is deliberate at its inception the 

76

 
 
 
decision to sulk can be reversed at any period of life just as it can be during childhood when it 
comes time for dinner the requirements for reversing the decision are the same for the grownup 
sulk as for the little boy he must be able to save face and he must be offered something 
worthwhile in exchange for the privilege of sulking sometimes a game of psychiatry which 
might otherwise last several years can be aborted by reversing a decision to sulk this requires 
careful preparation of the patient and proper timing and approach clumsiness or bullying on the 
part of the therapist will have no better result than it does with a sulky little boy in the long run the 
patient will pay the therapist back for his mishandling just as the little boy will eventually repay 
clumsy parents 
with female sulks the situation is the same mutatis mutandis if they are angry at father their 
wooden leg what do you expect of a woman who had a father like that must be handled 
with even more diplomacy by a male therapist otherwise he risks being thrown into the 
wastebasket of men who are like father 
there is a bit of jerk in everyone but the object of game analysis is to keep it at a minimum a jerk 
is someone who is overly sensitive to parental influences hence his adult data processing and his 
childs spontaneity are likely to be interfered with at critical moments resulting in inappropriate or 
clumsy behavior in extreme cases the jerk merges with the toady the showoff and the cling 
the jerk is not to be confused with the bewildered schizophrenic who has no functioning parent 
and very little functioning adult so that he has to cope with the world in the ego state of a 
confused child it is interesting that in common usage jerk is an epithet applied to men only or in 
rare cases to masculine women a prig is even more of a square than a jerk prig is a word usually 
reserved for women but occasionally it is said of men of somewhat feminine tendencies 

chapter fifteen 
a paradigm 
consider the following exchange between a patient p and a therapist t 
p i have a new projectbeing on time 
t ill try to cooperate 
p i do not care about you i am doing it for myself    guess what grade i got on my history test 
t b 
p how did you know 
t because you are afraid to get an a 
p yes i had an a and i went over my paper and crossed out three correct answers and put in 
three wrong ones 
t i like this conversation its jerkfree 
p you know last night i was thinking how much progress i have made i figured i was only 17 
jerk now 
t well so far this morning its zero so you are entitled to 34 discount on the next round 
p it all began six months ago that time i was looking at my coffeepot and for the first time i 
really saw it and you know how it is now how i hear the birds sing and i look at people and 
they are really there as people and best of all i am really there and i am not only there but right now 
i am here the other day i was standing in the art gallery looking at a picture and a man came up 
and said gauguin is very nice is not he so i said i like you too so we went out and had a drink 
and hes a very nice guy 
this is presented as a jerkfree gamefree conversation between two autonomous adults with die 
following annotations 
i have a new projectbeing on time this announcement was made after the fact the patient 
was nearly always late this time she was not if punctuality had been a resolution an act of will 
power an imposition of the parent on the child made only to be broken it would have been 
announced before the fact this is the last time ill be late that would have been an attempt to set 

77

 
 
up a game her announcement was not it was an adult decision a project not a resolution the 
patient continued to be punctual 
ill try to cooperate this was not a supportive statement nor the first move in a new game of 
i am only trying to help you the patients hour came after the therapists coffee break since she 
was habitually late he had fallen into the habit of taking his time and getting back late himself 
when she made her declaration he knew she meant it and made his the transaction was an adult 
contract which both of them kept and not a child teasing a parental figure who because of his 
position felt forced to be a good daddy and say he would cooperate 
i do not care about you this emphasizes that her punctuality is a decision and not a resolution to 
be exploited as part of a pseudocompliant game 
guess what grade i got this is a pastime which both were aware of and felt free to indulge in 
there was no need for him to demonstrate how alert he was by telling her it was a pastime 
something she already knew and there was no need for her to refrain from playing it just because it 
was called a pastime 
b the therapist reckoned that in her case this was the only possible grade and there was no 
reason not to say so false modesty or a fear of being wrong might have led him to pretend that he 
did not know 
how did you know this was an adult question not a game of gee you are wonderful and it 
deserved a pertinent answer 
yes i had an a this was the real test the patient did not sulk with rationalizations or pleas but 
faced her child squarely 
i like this conversation this and the following semifacetious remarks were expressions of 
mutual adult respect with perhaps a little parentchild pastime which again was optional with 
both of them and of which they were both aware 
for the first time i really saw it she is now entitled to her own kind of awareness and is no 
longer obliged to see coffeepots and people the way her parents told her to right now i am here 
she no longer lives in the future or the past but can discuss them briefly if it serves a useful 
purpose 
i said i like you too she is not obligedto waste time playing art gallery with the newcomer 
although she could if she chose to 
the therapist on his part does not feel obliged to play psychiatry there were several 
opportunities to bring up questions of defense transference and symbolic interpretation but he was 
able to let these go by without feeling any anxiety it did seem worthwhile however to ascertain 
for future reference which answers she crossed out on her examination during the rest of the hour 
unfortunately the 17 of jerk left in the patient and the 18 left in the therapist showed from time 
to time in summary the proceedings given constitute an activity enlightened with some pastime 

chapter sixteen 
autonomy 
the attainment of autonomy is manifested by the release or recovery of three capacities 
awareness spontaneity and 
intimacy 
awareness awareness means the capacity to see a coffeepot and hear the birds sing in ones own 
way and not the way one was taught it may be assumed on good grounds that seeing and hearing 
have a different quality for infants than for grownups1 and that they are more esthetic and less 
intellectual in the first years of life a little boy sees and hears birds with delight then the good 
father comes along and feels he should share the experience and help his son develop he says 
that is a jay and this is a sparrow the moment the little boy is concerned with which is a jay and 
which is a sparrow he can no longer see the birds or hear them sing he has to see and hear them 
the way his father wants him to father has good reasons on his side since few people can afford to 
go through life listening to the birds sing and the sooner the little boy starts his education the 

78

 
 
better maybe he will be an ornithologist when he grows up a few people however can still see 
and hear in the old way but most of the members of the human race have lost the capacity to be 
painters poets or musicians and are not left the option of seeing and hearing directly even if they 
can afford to they must get it secondhand the recovery of this ability is called here awareness 
physiologically awareness is eidetic perception allied to eidetic imagery2 perhaps there is also 
eidetic perception at least in certain individuals in the spheres of taste smell and kinesthesia 
giving us the artists in those fields chefs perfumers and dancers whose eternal problem is to find 
audiences capable of appreciating their products 
awareness requires living in the here and now and not in the elsewhere the past or the future a 
good illustration of possibilities in american life is driving to work in the morning in a hurry the 
decisive question is where is the mind when the body is here and there are three common cases 
1 the man whose chief preoccupation is being on time is die one who is furthest out with his 
body at the wheel of his car his mind is at the door of his office and he is oblivious to his 
immediate surroundings except insofar as they are obstacles to the moment when his soma will 
catch up with his psyche this is the jerk whose chief concern is how it will look to the boss if he 
is late he will take pains to arrive out of breath the compliant child is in command and his game 
is look how hard i have tried while he is driving he is almost completely lacking in autonomy 
and as a human being he is in essence more dead than alive it is quite possible that this is the most 
favorable condition for the development of hypertension or coronary disease 
2 the sulk on the other hand is not so much concerned with arriving on time as in collecting 
excuses for being late mishaps badly timed lights and poor driving or stupidity on the part of 
others fit well into his scheme and are secretly welcomed as contributions to his rebellious child or 
righteous parent game of look what they made me do he too is oblivious to his surroundings 
except as they subscribe to his game so that he is only half alive his body is in his car but his 
mind is out searching for blemishes and injustices 
3 less common is the natural driver the man to whom driving a car is a congenial science and 
art as he makes his way swiftly and skillfully through the traffic he is at one with his vehicle he 
too is oblivious of his surroundings except as they offer scope for the craftsmanship which is its 
own reward but he is very much aware of himself and the machine which he controls so well and 
to that extent he is alive such driving is formally an adult pastime from which his child and 
parent may also derive satisfaction 
4 the fourth case is the person who is aware and who will not hurry because he is living in the 
present moment with the environment which is here the sky and the trees as well as the feeling of 
motion to hurry is to neglect that environment and to be conscious only of something that is still 
out of sight down the road or of mere obstacles or solely of oneself a chinese man started to get 
into a local subway train when his caucasian companion pointed out that they could save twenty 
minutes by taking an express which they did when they got off at central park the chinese man 
sat down on a bench much to his friends surprise well explained the former since we saved 
twenty minutes we can afford to sit here that long and enjoy our surroundings 
the aware person is alive because he knows how he feels where he is and when it is he knows 
that after he dies the trees will still be there but he will not be there to look at them again so he 
wants to see them now with as much poignancy as possible 
spontaneity spontaneity means option the freedom to choose and express ones feelings from the 
assortment available parent feelings adult feelings and child feelings it means liberation 
liberation from the compulsion to play games and have only the feelings one was taught to have 
intimacy intimacy means the spontaneous gamefree candidness of an aware person the liberation 
of the eidetically perceptive uncorrupted child in all its naivete living in the here and now it can 
be shown experimentally3 that eidetic perception evokes affection and that candidness mobilizes 
positive feelings so that there is even such a thing as onesided intimacy  a phenomenon well 
known although not by that name to professional seducers who are able to capture their partners 
without becoming involved themselves this they do by encouraging the other person to look at 

79

 
them directly and to talk freely while the male or female seducer makes only a wellguarded 
pretense of reciprocating 
because intimacy is essentially a function of the natural child although expressed in a matrix of 
psychological and social complications it tends to turn out well if not disturbed by the intervention 
of games usually the adaptation to parental influences is what spoils it and most unfortunately 
this is almost a universal occurrence but before unless and until they are corrupted most infants 
seem to be loving4 and that is the essential nature of intimacy as shown experimentally

chapter seventeen 
the attainment of autonomy 
parents deliberately or unaware teach their children from birth how to behave drink feel and 
perceive liberation from these influences is no easy matter since they are deeply ingrained and 
are necessary during the first two or three decades of life for biological and social survival indeed 
such liberation is only possible at all because the individual starts off in an autonomous state that is 
capable of awareness spontaneity and intimacy and he has some discretion as to which parts of his 
parents teachings he will accept at certain specific moments early in life he decides how he is 
going to adapt to diem it is because his adaptation is in the nature of a series of decisions that it can 
be undone since decisions are reversible under favorable circumstances 
the attainment of autonomy then consists of the overthrow of all those irrelevancies discussed in 
chapters 13 14 and 15 and such overthrow is never final there is a continual battle against 
sinking back into the old ways 
first as discussed in chapter 13 the weight of a whole tribal or family historical tradition has to be 
lifted as in the case of margaret meads villagers in new guinea1 then the influence of the 
individual parental social and cultural background has to be thrown off the same must be done 
with the demands of contemporary society at large and finally die advantages derived from ones 
immediate social circle have to be partly or wholly sacrificed then all the easy indulgences and 
rewards of being a sulk or a jerk as described in chapter 14 have to be given up following this 
the individual must attain personal and social control so that all the classes of behavior described 
in the appendix except perhaps dreams become free choices subject only to his will he is then 
ready for gamefree relationships such as that illustrated in the paradigm in chapter 15 at this 
point he may be able to develop his capacities for autonomy in essence diis whole preparation 
consists of obtaining a friendly divorce from ones parents and from other parental influences so 
that they may be agreeably visited on occasion but are no longer dominant

chapter eighteen 
after games what 
the somber picture presented in parts i and ii of this book in which human life is mainly a 
process of filling in time until the arrival of death or santa claus with very little choice if any of 
what kind of business one is going to transact during the long wait is a commonplace but not the 
final answer for certain fortunate people there is something which transcends all classifications of 
behavior and that is awareness something which rises above the programming of the past and that 
is spontaneity and something that is more rewarding than games and that is intimacy but all three 
of these may be frightening and even perilous to the unprepared perhaps they are better off as they 
are seeking their solutions in popular techniques of social action such as togetherness this may 
mean that there is no hope for the human race but there is hope for individual members of it

the reader should feel free to carp but not to gleek or fleer at the above classification it is 
included not because the writer is in love with it but because it is more functional real and 
practical than other systems now in use and can be helpful to those who like or need taxonomy

preface to the fourth edition 

by warren e buffett

i read the first edition of this book early in 1950 when i was nine
teen i thought then that it was by far the best book about investing
ever written i still think it is

to invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato
spheric  iq  unusual  business  insights  or  inside  information
what is needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci
sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame
work  this  book  precisely  and  clearly  prescribes  the  proper
framework you must supply the emotional discipline

if  you  follow  the  behavioral  and  business  principles  that  gra
ham advocatesand if you pay special attention to the invaluable
advice in chapters 8 and 20you will not get a poor result from
your  investments  that  represents  more  of  an  accomplishment
than  you  might  think  whether  you  achieve  outstanding  results
will  depend  on  the  effort  and  intellect  you  apply  to  your  invest
ments as well as on the amplitudes of stockmarket folly that pre
vail during your investing career the sillier the markets behavior
the  greater  the  opportunity  for  the  businesslike  investor  follow
graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it
to me  ben  graham  was  far  more  than  an  author  or  a  teacher
more than any other man except my father he influenced my life
shortly  after  bens  death  in  1976  i  wrote  the  following  short
remembrance  about  him  in  the  financial  analysts  journal as  you
read the book i believe you will perceive some of the qualities i men
tioned in this tribute

preface to the fourth edition

benjamin graham

18941976

several years ago ben graham then almost eighty expressed to a friend
the thought that he hoped every day to do something foolish something
creative and something generous

the inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack
aging  ideas  in  a  form  that  avoided  any  overtones  of  sermonizing  or 
selfimportance  although  his  ideas  were  powerful  their  delivery  was
unfailingly gentle

readers  of  this  magazine  need  no  elaboration  of  his  achievements  as
measured by the standard of creativity it is rare that the founder of a disci
pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors
but  over  forty  years  after  publication  of  the  book  that  brought  structure
and logic to a disorderly and confused activity it is difficult to think of pos
sible  candidates  for  even  the  runnerup  position  in  the  field  of  security
analysis  in  an  area  where  much  looks  foolish  within  weeks  or  months
after publication bens principles have remained soundtheir value often
enhanced  and  better  understood  in  the  wake  of  financial  storms  that
demolished  flimsier  intellectual  structures  his  counsel  of  soundness
brought  unfailing  rewards  to  his  followerseven  to  those  with  natural
abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow
ing counsels of brilliance or fashion

a remarkable  aspect  of  bens  dominance  of  his  professional  field  was
that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen
trates all effort on a single end it was rather the incidental byproduct of
an  intellect  whose  breadth  almost  exceeded  definition  certainly  i  have
never  met  anyone  with  a  mind  of  similar  scope  virtually  total  recall
unending fascination with new knowledge and an ability to recast it in a
form  applicable  to  seemingly  unrelated  problems  made  exposure  to  his

a note about benjamin graham

by jason zweig

who was benjamin graham and why should you listen to him

graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived he was
also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time before graham
money managers behaved much like a medieval guild guided largely by
superstition guesswork and arcane rituals grahams security analysis
was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro
fession1

and the  intelligent  investor is the first book ever to describe for
individual investors the emotional framework and analytical tools that
are essential to financial success it remains the single best book on
investing  ever  written  for  the  general  public  the  intelligent  investor
was  the  first  book  i  read  when  i  joined  forbes magazine  as  a  cub
reporter in 1987 and i was struck by grahams certainty that sooner
or later all bull markets must end badly that october us stocks suf
fered their worst oneday crash in history and i was hooked today
after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market
that began in early 2000 the intelligent investor reads more prophet
ically than ever

graham came by his insights the hard way by feeling firsthand the
anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and
psychology  of  the  markets  he  was  born  benjamin  grossbaum  on
may 9 1894 in london his father was a dealer in china dishes and
figurines2 the family moved to new york when ben was a year old at
first they lived the good lifewith a maid a cook and a french gov

1 coauthored with david dodd and first published in 1934

when germansounding names were regarded with suspicion

a note about benjamin graham

ernesson  upper  fifth  avenue  but  bens  father  died  in  1903  the
porcelain  business  faltered  and  the  family  slid  haltingly  into  poverty
bens mother turned their home into a boardinghouse then borrow
ing money to trade stocks on margin she was wiped out in the crash
of  1907  for  the  rest  of  his  life  ben  would  recall  the  humiliation  of
cashing  a  check  for  his  mother  and  hearing  the  bank  teller  ask  is
dorothy grossbaum good for five dollars

fortunately  graham  won  a  scholarship  at  columbia  where  his 
brilliance  burst  into  full  flower  he  graduated  in  1914  second  in  his
class before the end of grahams final semester three departments
english  philosophy  and  mathematicsasked  him  to  join  the  faculty
he was all of 20 years old

instead of academia graham decided to give wall street a shot
he started as a clerk at a bondtrading firm soon became an analyst
then a partner and before long was running his own investment part
nership

the internet boom and bust would not have surprised graham in
april  1919  he  earned  a  250  return  on  the  first  day  of  trading  for
savold  tire  a  new  offering  in  the  booming  automotive  business  by
october  the  company  had  been  exposed  as  a  fraud  and  the  stock
was worthless

graham  became  a  master  at  researching  stocks  in  microscopic
almost  molecular  detail  in  1925  plowing  through  the  obscure
reports filed by oil pipelines with the us interstate commerce com
mission he learned that northern pipe line cothen trading at 65
per  shareheld  at  least  80  per  share  in  highquality  bonds  he
bought the stock pestered its managers into raising the dividend and
came away with 110 per share three years later

despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70 during the great crash of
19291932 graham survived and thrived in its aftermath harvesting
bargains  from  the  wreckage  of  the  bull  market  there  is  no  exact
record of grahams earliest returns but from 1936 until he retired in
1956  his  grahamnewman  corp  gained  at  least  147  annually
versus 122 for the stock market as a wholeone of the best long
term track records on wall street history3

own right for much of its history the fund was closed to new investors i am

how  did  graham  do  it  combining  his  extraordinary  intellectual
powers  with  profound  common  sense  and  vast  experience  graham
developed his core principles which are at least as valid today as they
were during his lifetime











a stock  is  not  just  a  ticker  symbol  or  an  electronic  blip  it  is  an
ownership interest in an actual business with an underlying value
that does not depend on its share price
the market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain
able optimism which makes stocks too expensive and unjustified
pessimism which makes them too cheap the intelligent investor
is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists
the  future  value  of  every  investment  is  a  function  of  its  present
price the higher the price you pay the lower your return will be
no matter how careful you are the one risk no investor can ever
eliminate  is  the  risk  of  being  wrong  only  by  insisting  on  what
graham called the margin of safetynever overpaying no mat
ter  how  exciting  an  investment  seems  to  becan  you  minimize
your odds of error
the  secret  to  your  financial  success  is  inside  yourself  if  you
become a critical thinker who takes no wall street fact on faith
and  you  invest  with  patient  confidence  you  can  take  steady
advantage  of  even  the  worst  bear  markets  by  developing  your
discipline and courage you can refuse to let other peoples mood
swings govern your financial destiny in the end how your invest
ments behave is much less important than how you behave

the goal of this revised edition of the intelligent investor is to apply
grahams  ideas  to  todays  financial  markets  while  leaving  his  text
entirely intact with the exception of footnotes for clarification4 after
each  of  grahams  chapters  you will  find  a  new  commentary  in  these
readers guides i have added recent examples that should show you just
how relevantand how liberatinggrahams principles remain today

grateful  to  walter  schloss  for  providing  data  essential  to  estimating 
grahamnewmans  returns  the  20  annual  average  return  that  graham
cites in his postscript p 532 appears not to take management fees into
account

ham in 19711972 and initially published in 1973

a note about benjamin graham

i envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading grahams

your  guide  you  are  guaranteed  to  become  a  vastly  more  intelligent

what this book expects to accomplish

the purpose of this book is to supply in a form suitable for lay
men guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment pol
icy  comparatively  little  will  be  said  here  about  the  technique  of
analyzing  securities  attention  will  be  paid  chiefly  to  investment
principles  and  investors  attitudes  we  shall  however  provide  a
number of condensed comparisons of specific securitieschiefly in
pairs appearing side by side in the new york stock exchange list
in order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements
involved in specific choices of common stocks

but much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns
of  financial  markets  in  some  cases  running  back  over  many
decades  to  invest  intelligently  in  securities  one  should  be  fore
armed  with  an  adequate  knowledge  of  how  the  various  types  of
bonds  and  stocks  have  actually  behaved  under  varying  condi
tionssome of which at least one is likely to meet again in ones
own experience no statement is more true and better applicable to
wall street than the famous warning of santayana those who do
not remember the past are condemned to repeat it

our text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula
tors and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all
but forgotten distinction we may say at the outset that this is not a
how to make a million book there are no sure and easy paths to
riches on wall street or anywhere else it may be well to point up
what  we  have  just  said  by  a  bit  of  financial  historyespecially
since there is more than one moral to be drawn from it in the cli
mactic year 1929 john j raskob a most important figure nationally
as well as on wall street extolled the blessings of capitalism in an
article in the ladies home journal entitled everybody ought to be

introduction

rich  his thesis was that savings of only 15 per month invested
in good common stockswith dividends reinvestedwould pro
duce an estate of 80000 in twenty years against total contributions
of  only  3600  if  the  general  motors  tycoon  was  right  this  was
indeed  a  simple  road  to  riches  how  nearly  right  was  he  our
rough calculationbased on assumed investment in the 30 stocks
making  up  the  dow  jones  industrial  average  djiaindicates
that if raskobs prescription had been followed during 19291948
the investors holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been
worth about 8500 this is a far cry from the great mans promise
of 80000 and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such
optimistic  forecasts  and  assurances  but  as  an  aside  we  should
remark  that  the  return  actually  realized  by  the  20year  operation
would have been better than 8 compounded annuallyand this
despite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases
with the djia at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948
closing level of 177 this record may be regarded as a persuasive
argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong
common  stocks  through  thick  and  thina  program  known  as 
dollarcost averaging

since  our  book  is  not  addressed  to  speculators  it  is  not  meant
for those who trade in the market most of these people are guided
by  charts  or  other  largely  mechanical  means  of  determining  the
right  moments  to  buy  and  sell  the  one  principle  that  applies  to
nearly all these socalled technical approaches is that one should
buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell
because it has declined this is the exact opposite of sound business
sense  everywhere  else  and  it  is  most  unlikely  that  it  can  lead  to

 raskob 18791950 was a director of du pont the giant chemical com
pany  and  chairman  of  the  finance  committee  at  general  motors  he  also
served  as  national  chairman  of  the  democratic  party  and  was  the  driving
force behind the construction of the empire state building calculations by
finance  professor  jeremy  siegel  confirm  that  raskobs  plan  would  have
grown  to  just  under  9000  after  20  years  although  inflation  would  have
eaten away much of that gain for the best recent look at raskobs views on
longterm stock investing see the essay by financial adviser william bern

lasting success on wall street in our own stockmarket experience
and  observation  extending  over  50  years  we  have  not  known  a
single  person  who  has  consistently  or  lastingly  made  money  by
thus following the market we do not hesitate to declare that this
approach  is  as  fallacious  as  it  is  popular  we  shall  illustrate  what
we  have  just  saidthough  of  course  this  should  not  be  taken  as
proofby  a  later  brief  discussion  of  the  famous  dow  theory  for
trading in the stock market

since  its  first  publication  in  1949  revisions  of  the  intelligent
investor have appeared at intervals of approximately five years in
updating  the  current  version  we  shall  have  to  deal  with  quite  a
number of new developments since the 1965 edition was written
these include

1 an unprecedented advance in the interest rate on highgrade

bonds

2 a fall  of  about  35  in  the  price  level  of  leading  common
stocks  ending  in  may  1970  this  was  the  highest  percentage
decline  in  some  30  years  countless  issues  of  lower  quality
had a much larger shrinkage

3 a persistent  inflation  of  wholesale  and  consumers  prices
which gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen
eral business in 1970

4 the  rapid  development  of  conglomerate  companies  fran
chise  operations  and  other  relative  novelties  in  business  and
finance these include a number of tricky devices such as let
ter stock 1 proliferation of stockoption warrants misleading
names use of foreign banks and others

 grahams brief discussion is in two parts on p 33 and pp 191192
for  more  detail  on  the  dow  theory  see  httpvikingsomyaleeduwill
dowdowpagehtml
 mutual  funds  bought  letter  stock  in  private  transactions  then  immedi
ately revalued these shares at a higher public price see grahams definition
on p 579 that enabled these gogo funds to report unsustainably high
returns  in  the  mid1960s  the  us  securities  and  exchange  commission
cracked down on this abuse in 1969 and it is no longer a concern for fund
investors stockoption warrants are explained in chapter 16

introduction

5 bankruptcy of our largest railroad excessive short and long
term  debt  of  many  formerly  strongly  entrenched  companies
and even a disturbing problem of solvency among wall street
houses

6 the advent of the performance vogue in the management of
investment funds including some bankoperated trust funds
with disquieting results

these phenomena will have our careful consideration and some
will require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ
ous edition the underlying principles of sound investment should
not alter from decade to decade but the application of these princi
ples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha
nisms and climate

the last statement was put to the test during the writing of the
present  edition  the  first  draft  of  which  was  finished  in  january
1971 at that time the djia was in a strong recovery from its 1970
low  of  632  and  was  advancing  toward  a  1971  high  of  951  with
attendant  general  optimism  as  the  last  draft  was  finished  in
november 1971 the market was in the throes of a new decline car
rying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its
future we have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general
attitude toward sound investment policy which remains substan
tially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949

the  extent  of  the  markets  shrinkage  in  196970  should  have
served  to  dispel  an  illusion  that  had  been  gaining  ground  dur
ing  the  past  two  decades  this  was  that  leading  common  stocks
could be bought at any time and at any price with the assurance not
only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon
be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev

els that was too good to be true at long last the stock market has
returned to normal in the sense that both speculators and stock
investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per
haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings

in  the  area  of  many  secondary  and  thirdline  common  stocks
especially  recently  floated  enterprises  the  havoc  wrought  by  the
last  market  break  was  catastrophic  this  was  nothing  new  in
itselfit had happened to a similar degree in 196162but there
was  now  a  novel  element  in  the  fact  that  some  of  the  investment
funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously
overvalued issues of this type evidently it is not only the tyro who
needs  to  be  warned  that  while  enthusiasm  may  be  necessary  for
great accomplishments elsewhere on wall street it almost invari
ably leads to disaster

the major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the
huge rise in the rate of interest on firstquality bonds since late 1967
the  investor  has  been  able  to  obtain  more  than  twice  as  much
income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa
tive common stocks at the beginning of 1972 the return was 719
on  highestgrade  bonds  versus  only  276  on  industrial  stocks
this  compares  with  440  and  292  respectively  at  the  end  of
1964 it is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949
the figures were almost the exact opposite the bonds returned only
266 and the stocks yielded 6822 in previous editions we have
consistently urged that at least 25 of the conservative investors
portfolio be held in common stocks and we have favored in general
a  5050  division  between  the  two  media  we  must  now  consider
whether  the  current  great  advantage  of  bond  yields  over  stock
yields would justify an allbond policy until a more sensible rela
tionship returns as we expect it will naturally the question of con
tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision
here a chapter will be devoted to this discussion

 see chapter 2 as of the beginning of 2003 us treasury bonds matur
ing in 10 years yielded 38 while stocks as measured by the dow jones
industrial average yielded 19 note that this relationship is not all that
different from the 1964 figures that graham cites the income generated
by topquality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981

introduction

in the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds
of  investors  to  whom  this  book  was  addressedthe  defensive
and  the  enterprising  the  defensive  or  passive  investor  will
place  his  chief  emphasis  on  the  avoidance  of  serious  mistakes  or
losses his second aim will be freedom from effort annoyance and
the  need  for  making  frequent  decisions  the  determining  trait  of
the enterprising or active or aggressive investor is his willingness
to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both
sound  and  more  attractive  than  the  average  over  many  decades
an  enterprising  investor  of  this  sort  could  expect  a  worthwhile
reward for his extra skill and effort in the form of a better average
return  than  that  realized  by  the  passive  investor  we  have  some
doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to
the active investor under todays conditions but next year or the
years after may well be different we shall accordingly continue to
devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment as
they existed in former periods and may return

it  has  long  been  the  prevalent  view  that  the  art  of  success
ful  investment  lies  first  in  the  choice  of  those  industries  that 
are  most  likely  to  grow  in  the  future  and  then  in  identifying  the
most promising companies in these industries for example smart
investorsor  their  smart  adviserswould  long  ago  have  recog
nized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a
whole  and  of  international  business  machines  in  particular and
similarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com
panies  but  this  is  not  as  easy  as  it  always  looks  in  retrospect  to
bring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that
we included first in the 1949 edition of this book

such  an  investor  may  for  example  be  a  buyer  of  airtransport
stocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than
the trend the market already reflects for this class of investor the
value of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls
lurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive
technique that will help him along his path

 airtransport stocks of course generated as much excitement in the late
1940s and early 1950s as internet stocks did a half century later among
the  hottest  mutual  funds  of  that  era  were  aeronautical  securities  and  the

what this book expects to accomplish

7

the pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry
we mentioned it was of course easy to forecast that the volume of
air traffic would grow spectacularly over the years because of this
factor  their  shares  became  a  favorite  choice  of  the  investment
funds  but  despite  the  expansion  of  revenuesat  a  pace  even
greater  than  in  the  computer  industrya  combination  of  techno
logical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat
ing and even disastrous profit figures in the year 1970 despite a
new  high  in  traffic  figures  the  airlines  sustained  a  loss  of  some
200 million for their shareholders they had shown losses also in
1945 and 1961 the stocks of these companies once again showed a
greater decline in 196970 than did the general market the record
shows  that  even  the  highly  paid  fulltime  experts  of  the  mutual
funds were completely wrong about the fairly shortterm future of
a major and nonesoteric industry

on the other hand while the investment funds had substantial
investments  and  substantial  gains  in  ibm  the  combination  of  its
apparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about
its rate of growth prevented them from having more than say 3
of  their  funds  in  this  wonderful  performer  hence  the  effect  of 
this  excellent  choice  on  their  overall  results  was  by  no  means 
decisive furthermore manyif not mostof their investments in
computerindustry companies other than ibm appear to have been
unprofitable from these two broad examples we draw two morals
for our readers

1 obvious  prospects  for  physical  growth  in  a  business  do  not

translate into obvious profits for investors

2 the  experts  do  not  have  dependable  ways  of  selecting  and
concentrating  on  the  most  promising  companies  in  the  most
promising industries

missilesrocketsjets  automation fund they like the stocks they owned
turned out to be an investing disaster it is commonly accepted today that
the  cumulative  earnings  of  the  airline  industry  over  its  entire  history  have
been negative the lesson graham is driving at is not that you should avoid
buying airline stocks but that you should never succumb to the certainty
that any industry will outperform all others in the future

introduction

the author did not follow this approach in his financial career as
fund manager and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much
encouragement to those who may wish to try it

what  then  will  we  aim  to  accomplish  in  this  book  our  main
objective  will  be  to  guide  the  reader  against  the  areas  of  possible
substantial  error  and  to  develop  policies  with  which  he  will  be
comfortable  we  shall  say  quite  a  bit  about  the  psychology  of
investors for indeed the investors chief problemand even his
worst enemyis likely to be himself the fault dear investor is
not in our starsand not in our stocksbut in ourselves    this
has  proved  the  more  true  over  recent  decades  as  it  has  become
more  necessary  for  conservative  investors  to  acquire  common
stocks and thus to expose themselves willynilly to the excitement
and the temptations of the stock market by arguments examples
and exhortation we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper
mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions
we have seen much more money made and kept by ordinary peo
ple  who  were  temperamentally  well  suited  for  the  investment
process  than  by  those  who  lacked  this  quality  even  though  they
had  an  extensive  knowledge  of  finance  accounting  and  stock
market lore

additionally  we  hope  to  implant  in  the  reader  a  tendency  to
measure or quantify for 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at
some price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price
they would be so dear that they should be sold the habit of relat
ing  what  is  paid  to  what  is  being  offered  is  an  invaluable  trait  in
investment in an article in a womens magazine many years ago
we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro
ceries not as they bought their perfume the really dreadful losses
of the past few years and on many similar occasions before were
realized  in  those  commonstock  issues  where  the  buyer  forgot  to
ask how much

in june 1970 the question how much could be answered by
the  magic  figure  940the  yield  obtainable  on  new  offerings  of
highgrade  publicutility  bonds  this  has  now  dropped  to  about
73 but even that return tempts us to ask why give any other
answer but there are other possible answers and these must be
carefully  considered  besides  which  we  repeat  that  both  we  and
our readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif
ferent conditions of say 19731977

what this book expects to accomplish

9

we shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for
commonstock investment part of which is within the purview of
both classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter
prising  group  strangely  enough  we  shall  suggest  as  one  of  our
chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues
selling  not  far  above  their  tangibleasset  value  the  reason  for 
this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi
cal  experience  has  taught  us  that  while  there  are  many  good
growth  companies  worth  several  times  net  assets  the  buyer  of
such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations
of  the  stock  market  by  contrast  the  investor  in  shares  say  of 
publicutility companies at about their netasset value can always
consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding
businesses  acquired  at  a  rational  priceregardless  of  what  the
stock market might say to the contrary the ultimate result of such
a  conservative  policy  is  likely  to  work  out  better  than  exciting
adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated
growth

the art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally
appreciated a creditable if unspectacular result can be achieved
by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability but to
improve this easily attainable standard requires much application
and more than a trace of wisdom if you merely try to bring just a
little extra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment
program instead of realizing a little better than normal results you
may well find that you have done worse

since  anyoneby  just  buying  and  holding  a  representative
listcan  equal  the  performance  of  the  market  averages  it  would
seem a comparatively simple matter to beat the averages but as
a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail
is  surprisingly  large  even  the  majority  of  the  investment  funds
with  all  their  experienced  personnel  have  not  performed  so  well

 tangible  assets  include  a  companys  physical  property  like  real  estate
factories equipment and inventories as well as its financial balances such
as cash shortterm investments and accounts receivable among the ele
ments not included in tangible assets are brands copyrights patents fran
chises  goodwill  and  trademarks  to  see  how  to  calculate  tangibleasset
value see footnote  on p 198

introduction

over  the  years  as  has  the  general  market allied  to  the  foregoing 
is  the  record  of  the  published  stockmarket  predictions  of  the 
brokerage houses for there is strong evidence that their calculated
forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing
of a coin

in  writing  this  book  we  have  tried  to  keep  this  basic  pitfall  of
investment in mind the virtues of a simple portfolio policy have
been emphasizedthe purchase of highgrade bonds plus a diver
sified list of leading common stockswhich any investor can carry
out with a little expert assistance the adventure beyond this safe
and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng
ing  difficulties  especially  in  the  area  of  temperament  before
attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself
and  of  his  advisersparticularly  as  to  whether  they  have  a  clear
concept of the differences between investment and speculation and
between market price and underlying value

a strongminded  approach  to  investment  firmly  based  on  the
marginofsafety  principle  can  yield  handsome  rewards  but  a
decision  to  try  for  these  emoluments  rather  than  for  the  assured
fruits of defensive investment should not be made without much
selfexamination

a final  retrospective  thought  when  the  young  author  entered
wall street in june 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next
halfcentury had in store the stock market did not even suspect
that a world war was to break out in two months and close down
the new york stock exchange now in 1972 we find ourselves the
richest and most powerful country on earth but beset by all sorts
of  major  problems  and  more  apprehensive  than  confident  of  the
future  yet  if  we  confine  our  attention  to  american  investment
experience  there  is  some  comfort  to  be  gleaned  from  the  last  57
years  through  all  their  vicissitudes  and  casualties  as  earth
shaking  as  they  were  unforeseen  it  remained  true  that  sound
investment principles produced generally sound results we must
act on the assumption that they will continue to do so

note to the reader this book does not address itself to the overall
financial  policy  of  savers  and  investors  it  deals  only  with  that

ketable  or  redeemable  securities  that  is  in  bonds  and  stocks

commentary on the introduction

if you have built castles in the air your work need not be lost
that is where they should be now put the foundations under
them

henry david thoreau walden

notice that graham announces from the start that this book will not

tell you how to beat the market no truthful book can

instead this book will teach you three powerful lessons





how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses
how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains
how you can control the selfdefeating behavior that keeps most
investors from reaching their full potential

back in the boom years of the late 1990s when technology stocks
seemed to be doubling in value every day the notion that you could
lose almost all your money seemed absurd but by the end of 2002
many of the dotcom and telecom stocks had lost 95 of their value
or more once you lose 95 of your money you have to gain 1900
just  to  get  back  to  where  you  started1 taking  a  foolish  risk  can  put
you so deep in the hole that its virtually impossible to get out that is
why  graham  constantly  emphasizes  the  importance  of  avoiding
lossesnot just in chapters 6 14 and 20 but in the threads of warn
ing that he has woven throughout his entire text

but  no  matter  how  careful  you  are  the  price  of  your  investments
will go down from time to time while no one can eliminate that risk

1 to put this statement in perspective consider how often you are likely to
buy a stock at 30 and be able to sell it at 600

graham will show you how to manage itand how to get your fears
under control

a r e   y o you   a n   i n t e l l i g e n t   i n v e s t o are 

now let us answer a vitally important question what exactly does gra
ham mean by an intelligent investor back in the first edition of this
book graham defines the termand he makes it clear that this kind of
intelligence has nothing to do with iq or sat scores it simply means
being patient disciplined and eager to learn you must also be able to
harness your emotions and think for yourself this kind of intelligence
explains graham is a trait more of the character than of the brain 2

there is proof that high iq and higher education are not enough to
make an investor intelligent in 1998 longterm capital management
lp  a  hedge  fund  run  by  a  battalion  of  mathematicians  computer 
scientists  and  two  nobel  prizewinning  economists  lost  more  than 
2  billion  in  a  matter  of  weeks  on  a  huge  bet  that  the  bond  market
would return to normal but the bond market kept right on becoming
more and more abnormaland ltcm had borrowed so much money
that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system3

and back in the spring of 1720 sir isaac newton owned shares in
the south sea company the hottest stock in england sensing that
the market was getting out of hand the great physicist muttered that
he  could  calculate  the  motions  of  the  heavenly  bodies  but  not  the
madness of the people newton dumped his south sea shares pock
eting a 100 profit totaling 7000 but just months later swept up in
the wild enthusiasm of the market newton jumped back in at a much
higher  priceand  lost  20000  or  more  than  3  million  in  todays
money for the rest of his life he forbade anyone to speak the words
south sea in his presence4

commentary on the introduction

sir isaac newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever
lived as most of us would define intelligence but in grahams terms
newton was far from an intelligent investor by letting the roar of the
crowd override his own judgment the worlds greatest scientist acted
like a fool

in short if you have failed at investing so far its not because you are
stupid its because like sir isaac newton you have not developed the
emotional discipline that successful investing requires in chapter 8
graham  describes  how  to  enhance  your  intelligence  by  harnessing
your emotions and refusing to stoop to the markets level of irrational
ity there you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is
more a matter of character than brain

a   c h r o n i c l e   o f   c a l a m i t y

now let us take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel
opments of the past few years

1 the  worst  market  crash  since  the  great  depression  with  us
stocks  losing  502  of  their  valueor  74  trillionbetween
march 2000 and october 2002

2 far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of
the  1990s  including  aol  cisco  jds  uniphase  lucent  and
qualcommplus  the  utter  destruction  of  hundreds  of  internet
stocks

3 accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest and
most  respected  corporations  in  america  including  enron  tyco
and xerox

4 the  bankruptcies  of  such  onceglistening  companies  as  con

seco global crossing and worldcom

5 allegations  that  accounting  firms  cooked  the  books  and  even
destroyed records to help their clients mislead the investing public
6 charges  that  top  executives  at  leading  companies  siphoned  off

hundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain

7 proof that security analysts on wall street praised stocks publicly

but admitted privately that they were garbage

8 a stock market that even after its bloodcurdling decline seems
overvalued  by  historical  measures  suggesting  to  many  experts
that stocks have further yet to fall

commentary on the introduction

15

9 a relentless decline in interest rates that has left investors with no

attractive alternative to stocks

10 an investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace

of global terrorism and war in the middle east

much  of  this  damage  could  have  been  and  was  avoided  by
investors who learned and lived by grahams principles as graham
puts  it  while  enthusiasm  may  be  necessary  for  great  accomplish
ments elsewhere on wall street it almost invariably leads to disaster
by  letting  themselves  get  carried  awayon  internet  stocks  on  big
growth stocks on stocks as a wholemany people made the same
stupid  mistakes  as  sir  isaac  newton  they  let  other  investors  judg
ments determine their own they ignored grahams warning that the
really  dreadful  losses  always  occur  after  the  buyer  forgot  to  ask
how  much   most  painfully  of  all  by  losing  their  selfcontrol  just
when they needed it the most these people proved grahams asser
tion that the investors chief problemand even his worst enemyis
likely to be himself

many of those people got especially carried away on technology and
internet stocks believing the hightech hype that this industry would
keep outgrowing every other for years to come if not forever

in  february  2000  hedgefund  manager  james  j  cramer  pro
claimed that internetrelated companies are the only ones worth

have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that
existed before the web    if we used any of what graham and
dodd teach us we would not have a dime under management 7

all these socalled experts ignored grahams sober words of warn
ing  obvious  prospects  for  physical  growth  in  a  business  do  not
translate  into  obvious  profits  for  investors  while  it  seems  easy  to
foresee which industry will grow the fastest that foresight has no real
value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing by
the time everyone decides that a given industry is obviously the best

one to invest in the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that
its future returns have nowhere to go but down

for now at least no one has the gall to try claiming that technology
will  still  be  the  worlds  greatest  growth  industry  but  make  sure  you
remember this the people who now claim that the next sure thing
will be health care or energy or real estate or gold are no more likely
to be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be

t h e   s i l v e are   l i n i n g

if no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s in 2003 we have
reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough the
pendulum has swung as graham knew it always does from irrational
exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism in 2002 investors yanked 27
billion out of stock mutual funds and a survey conducted by the secu
rities industry association found that one out of 10 investors had cut
back on stocks by at least 25 the same people who were eager to
buy stocks in the late 1990swhen they were going up in price and
therefore  becoming  expensivesold  stocks  as  they  went  down  in
price and by definition became cheaper

as graham shows so brilliantly in chapter 8 this is exactly back
wards the intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky
not less as their prices riseand less risky not more as their prices
fall the intelligent investor dreads a bull market since it makes stocks
more costly to buy and conversely so long as you keep enough cash
on hand to meet your spending needs you should welcome a bear
market since it puts stocks back on sale8

so  take  heart  the  death  of  the  bull  market  is  not  the  bad  news
everyone believes it to be thanks to the decline in stock prices now
is  a  considerably  saferand  sanertime  to  be  building  wealth  read
on and let graham show you how

8 the  only  exception  to  this  rule  is  an  investor  in  the  advanced  stage  of
retirement who may not be able to outlast a long bear market yet even an
elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone
down in price that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones
but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs
for tax purposes

chapter 1

investment versus speculation results to

be expected by the intelligent investor

this  chapter  will  outline  the  viewpoints  that  will  be  set  forth  in
the remainder of the book in particular we wish to develop at the
outset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ
ual nonprofessional investor

investment versus speculation

what  do  we  mean  by  investor  throughout  this  book  the
term will be used in contradistinction to speculator as far back
as 1934 in our textbook security analysis1 we attempted a precise
formulation  of  the  difference  between  the  two  as  follows  an
investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis prom
ises  safety  of  principal  and  an  adequate  return  operations  not
meeting these requirements are speculative

while  we  have  clung  tenaciously  to  this  definition  over  the
ensuing 38 years it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that
have occurred in the use of the term investor during this period
after  the  great  market  decline  of  19291932  all common  stocks
were widely regarded as speculative by nature a leading author
ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment2
thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that
it gave too wide scope to the concept of investment

now our concern is of the opposite sort we must prevent our
readers from accepting the common jargon which applies the term
investor to anybody and everybody in the stock market in our
last edition we cited the following headline of a frontpage article
of our leading financial journal in june 1962

18

investment versus speculation

19

small investors bearish they are selling oddlots short

in october 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it
called  reckless  investors  who  this  time  were  rushing  in  on  the
buying side

these  quotations  well  illustrate  the  confusion  that  has  been
dominant for many years in the use of the words investment and
speculation think of our suggested definition of investment given
above and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an
inexperienced member of the public who does not even own what
he  is  selling  and  has  some  largely  emotional  conviction  that  he
will be able to buy them back at a much lower price it is not irrel
evant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market
had already experienced a decline of major size and was now get
ting ready for an even greater upswing it was about as poor a time
as possible for selling short in a more general sense the laterused
phrase reckless investors could be regarded as a laughable con
tradiction  in  termssomething  like  spendthrift  miserswere
this misuse of language not so mischievous

the  newspaper  employed  the  word  investor  in  these
instances  because  in  the  easy  language  of  wall  street  everyone
who buys or sells a security has become an investor regardless of
what he buys or for what purpose or at what price or whether for
cash  or  on  margin  compare  this  with  the  attitude  of  the  public
toward  common  stocks  in  1948  when  over  90  of  those  queried
expressed  themselves  as  opposed  to  the  purchase  of  common
stocks3 about half gave as their reason not safe a gamble and
about  half  the  reason  not  familiar  with  it  is  indeed  ironical

 the survey graham cites was conducted for the fed by the university of
michigan  and  was  published  in  the  federal  reserve  bulletin july  1948
people were asked suppose a man decides not to spend his money he
can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it what do you think
would be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadaysput it in
the bank buy savings bonds with it invest it in real estate or buy common
stock with it only 4 thought common stock would offer a satisfactory
return  26  considered  it  not  safe  or  a  gamble  from  1949  through
1958 the stock market earned one of its highest 10year returns in history

20

the intelligent investor

though not surprising that commonstock purchases of all kinds
were  quite  generally  regarded  as  highly  speculative  or  risky  at  a
time  when  they  were  selling  on  a  most  attractive  basis  and  due
soon to begin their greatest advance in history conversely the very
fact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev
els as judged by past experience later transformed them into invest
ments and the entire stockbuying public into investors

the distinction between investment and speculation in common
stocks  has  always  been  a  useful  one  and  its  disappearance  is  a
because for concern we have often said that wall street as an institu
tion  would  be  well  advised  to  reinstate  this  distinction  and  to
emphasize it in all its dealings with the public otherwise the stock
exchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses
which  those  who  suffered  them  had  not  been  properly  warned
against ironically once more much of the recent financial embar
rassment of some stockexchange firms seems to have come from
the  inclusion  of  speculative  common  stocks  in  their  own  capital
funds we trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably
clear idea of the risks that are inherent in commonstock commit
mentsrisks  which  are  inseparable  from  the  opportunities  of
profit that they offer and both of which must be allowed for in the
investors calculations

what  we  have  just  said  indicates  that  there  may  no  longer  be
such a thing as a simonpure investment policy comprising repre
sentative common stocksin the sense that one can always wait to
buy  them  at  a  price  that  involves  no  risk  of  a  market  or  quota
tional  loss  large  enough  to  be  disquieting  in  most  periods  the
investor  must  recognize  the  existence  of  a  speculative  factor in  his
commonstock  holdings  it  is  his  task  to  keep  this  component
within minor limits and to be prepared financially and psycholog
ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration

two  paragraphs  should  be  added  about  stock  speculation  per
se as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent

averaging 187 annually in a fascinating echo of that early fed survey a
poll conducted by businessweek at yearend 2002 found that only 24 of
investors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios
down from 47 just three years earlier

investment versus speculation

21

in  most  representative  common  stocks  outright  speculation  is 
neither  illegal  immoral  nor  for  most  people  fattening  to  the
pocketbook  more  than  that  some  speculation  is  necessary  and
unavoidable for in many commonstock situations there are sub
stantial  possibilities  of  both  profit  and  loss  and  the  risks  therein
must be assumed by someone there is intelligent speculation as
there  is  intelligent  investing  but  there  are  many  ways  in  which
speculation  may  be  unintelligent  of  these  the  foremost  are  1
speculating when you think you are investing 2 speculating seri
ously  instead  of  as  a  pastime  when  you  lack  proper  knowledge
and skill for it and 3 risking more money in speculation than you
can afford to lose

in  our  conservative  view  every  nonprofessional  who  operates
on margin should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating and it
is  his  brokers  duty  so  to  advise  him and  everyone  who  buys  a
socalled  hot  commonstock  issue  or  makes  a  purchase  in  any
way similar thereto is either speculating or gambling speculation
is always fascinating and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead
of the game if you want to try your luck at it put aside a portion
the  smaller  the  betterof  your  capital  in  a  separate  fund  for  this
purpose never add more money to this account just because the

 speculation is beneficial on two levels first without speculation untested
new  companies  like  amazoncom  or  in  earlier  times  the  edison  electric
light co would never be able to raise the necessary capital for expansion
the alluring longshot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates
the  machinery  of  innovation  secondly  risk  is  exchanged  but  never  elimi
nated every time a stock is bought or sold the buyer purchases the primary
risk that this stock may go down meanwhile the seller still retains a residual
riskthe chance that the stock he just sold may go up
 a margin  account  enables  you  to  buy  stocks  using  money  you  borrow
from the brokerage firm by investing with borrowed money you make more
when your stocks go upbut you can be wiped out when they go down the
collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your accountso you
must put up more money if that value falls below the amount you borrowed

the intelligent investor

market  has  gone  up  and  profits  are  rolling  in  that is  the  time  to
think of taking money out of your speculative fund never mingle
your  speculative  and  investment  operations  in  the  same  account
nor in any part of your thinking

results to be expected by the defensive investor

we have  already  defined  the  defensive  investor  as  one  inter
ested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother in general what
course  should  he  follow  and  what  return  can  he  expect  under
average  normal  conditionsif  such  conditions  really  exist  to
answer  these  questions  we  shall  consider  first  what  we  wrote  on
the  subject  seven  years  ago  next  what  significant  changes  have
occurred  since  then  in  the  underlying  factors  governing  the
investors  expectable  return  and  finally  what  he  should  do  and
what he should expect under presentday early 1972 conditions

1 what we said six years ago

we recommended that the investor divide his holdings between
highgrade bonds and leading common stocks that the proportion
held in bonds be never less than 25 or more than 75 with the
converse being necessarily true for the commonstock component
that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 5050 proportion
between  the  two  with  adjustments  to  restore  the  equality  when
market developments had disturbed it by as much as say 5 as
an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his commonstock
component  to  25  if  he  felt  the  market  was  dangerously  high
and  conversely  to  advance  it  toward  the  maximum  of  75  if  he
felt  that  a  decline  in  stock  prices  was  making  them  increasingly
attractive

in 1965 the investor could obtain about 412 on highgrade tax
able bonds and 314 on good taxfree bonds the dividend return
on leading common stocks with the djia at 892 was only about
32 this fact and others suggested caution we implied that at
normal levels of the market the investor should be able to obtain
an  initial  dividend  return  of  between  312  and  412  on  his  stock
purchases to which should be added a steady increase in underly
ing  value  and  in  the  normal  market  price  of  a  representative

investment versus speculation

23

stock  list  of  about  the  same  amount  giving  a  return  from  divi
dends and appreciation combined of about 712 per year the half
and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6
before  income  tax  we  added  that  the  stock  component  should
carry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power
caused by largescale inflation

it  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  above  arithmetic  indicated
expectation  of  a  much  lower  rate  of  advance  in  the  stock  market
than had been realized between 1949 and 1964 that rate had aver
aged a good deal better than 10 for listed stocks as a whole and it
was quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly
satisfactory results could be counted on in the future few people
were willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate
of advance in the past means that stock prices are now too high
and hence that the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not
very good but bad results for the future 4

2 what has happened since 1964

the major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on
firstgrade  bonds  to  record  high  levels  although  there  has  since
been  a  considerable  recovery  from  the  lowest  prices  of  1970  the
obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 712 and
even  more  against  412  in  1964  in  the  meantime  the  dividend
return on djiatype stocks had a fair advance also during the mar
ket decline of 196970 but as we write with the dow at 900 it is
less than 35 against 32 at the end of 1964 the change in going
interest  rates  produced  a  maximum  decline  of  about  38  in  the
market  price  of  mediumterm  say  20year  bonds  during  this
period

there is a paradoxical aspect to these developments in 1964 we
discussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be
too high and subject ultimately to a serious decline but we did not
consider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to
the  price  of  highgrade  bonds  neither  did  anyone  else  that  we
know of we did warn on p 90 that a longterm bond may vary
widely in price in response to changes in interest rates in the light
of  what  has  since  happened  we  think  that  this  warningwith
attendant exampleswas insufficiently stressed for the fact is that

24

the intelligent investor

if the investor had a given sum in the djia at its closing price of
874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971
even at the lowest level 631 in 1970 his indicated loss would have
been less than that shown on good longterm bonds on the other
hand if he had confined his bondtype investments to us savings
bonds shortterm corporate issues or savings accounts he would
have had no loss in market value of his principal during this period
and  he  would  have  enjoyed  a  higher  income  return  than  was
offered  by  good  stocks  it  turned  out  therefore  that  true  cash
equivalents proved to be better investments in 1964 than common
stocksin  spite  of  the  inflation  experience  that  in  theory  should
have  favored  stocks  over  cash  the  decline  in  quoted  principal
value of good longerterm bonds was due to developments in the
money market an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an
important bearing on the investment policy of individuals

this is just another of an endless series of experiences over time
that have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never
predictable almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than
stock prices and investors generally could buy good bonds of any
maturity  without  having  to  worry  about  changes  in  their  market
value there were a few exceptions to this rule and the period after
1964  proved  to  be  one  of  them  we  shall  have  more  to  say  about
change in bond prices in a later chapter

3 expectations and policy in late 1971 and early 1972

toward  the  end  of  1971  it  was  possible  to  obtain  8  taxable
interest on good mediumterm corporate bonds and 57 taxfree
on good state or municipal securities in the shorterterm field the
investor could realize about 6 on us government issues due in
five years in the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about

 read grahams sentence again and note what this greatest of investing 
experts is saying the future of security prices is never predictable and as
you read ahead in the book notice how everything else graham tells you is
designed to help you grapple with that truth since you cannot predict the

a possible loss in market value since he is sure of full repayment
including  the  6  interest  return  at  the  end  of  a  comparatively
short holding period the djia at its recurrent price level of 900 in
1971 yields only 35

let us assume that now as in the past the basic policy decision
to  be  made  is  how  to  divide  the  fund  between  highgrade  bonds
or  other  socalled  cash  equivalents  and  leading  djiatype
stocks what course should the investor follow under present con
ditions if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant
upward or a significant downward movement for some time in the
future  first  let  us  point  out  that  if  there  is  no  serious  adverse
change the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur
rent  35  dividend  return  on  his  stocks  and  also  on  an  average
annual  appreciation  of  about  4  as  we  shall  explain  later  this
appreciation  is  based  essentially  on  the  reinvestment  by  the  vari
ous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis
tributed  profits  on  a  beforetax  basis  the  combined  return  of  his
stocks would then average say 75 somewhat less than his inter
est on highgrade bonds on an aftertax basis the average return
on stocks would work out at some 535 this would be about the
same as is now obtainable on good taxfree mediumterm bonds

these  expectations  are  much  less  favorable  for  stocks  against
bonds  than  they  were  in  our  1964  analysis  that  conclusion  fol
lows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up
much more than stock yields since 1964 we must never lose sight

 how  well  did  grahams  forecast  pan  out  at  first  blush  it  seems  very
well from the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981 stocks earned
an annual average return of 65 graham did not specify the time period
for his forecast but its plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10
year  time  horizon  however  inflation  raged  at  86  annually  over  this
period eating up the entire gain that stocks produced in this section of his
chapter graham is summarizing what is known as the gordon equation
which essentially holds that the stock markets future return is the sum of the
current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth with a dividend yield
of  just  under  2  in  early  2003  and  longterm  earnings  growth  of  around
2 plus inflation at a bit over 2 a future average annual return of roughly
6 is plausible see the commentary on chapter 3

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds
are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi
dends  and  price  appreciation  on  stocks  consequently  we  are
forced  to  the  conclusion  that  now  toward  the  end  of  1971  bond
investment  appears  clearly  preferable  to  stock  investment  if  we
could be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise
the  defensive  investor  to  put  all his  money  in  bonds  and  none in
common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi
cantly in favor of stocks

but of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet
ter  than  stocks  from  todays  levels  the  reader  will  immediately
think of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side in
the  next  chapter  we  shall  argue  that  our  considerable  experience
with inflation in the united states during this century would not
support the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials
in yield but there is always the possibilitythough we consider it
remoteof an accelerating inflation which in one way or another
would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a
fixed  amount  of  dollars  there  is  the  alternative  possibility
which  we  also  consider  highly  unlikelythat american  business
will become so profitable without steppedup inflation as to jus
tify a large increase in commonstock values in the next few years
finally there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness
another  great  speculative  rise  in  the  stock  market  without  a  real
justification  in  the  underlying  values  any  of  these  reasons  and
perhaps others we have not thought of might cause the investor to
regret a 100 concentration on bonds even at their more favorable
yield levels

hence after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider
ations we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy

 since 1997 when treasury inflationprotected securities or tips were
introduced  stocks  have  no  longer  been  the  automatically  superior  choice
for investors who expect inflation to increase tips unlike other bonds rise
in  value  if  the  consumer  price  index  goes  up  effectively  immunizing  the
investor against losing money after inflation stocks carry no such guarantee
and in fact are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation for

for defensive investorsnamely that at all times they have a signif
icant  part  of  their  funds  in  bondtype  holdings  and  a  significant
part  also  in  equities  it  is  still  true  that  they  may  choose  between
maintaining a simple 5050 division between the two components
or a ratio dependent on their judgment varying between a mini
mum of 25 and a maximum of 75 of either we shall give our
more detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter

since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks
is  nearly  the  same  as  that  from  bonds  the  presently  expectable
return  including  growth  of  stock  values  for  the  investor  would
change  little  regardless  of  how  he  divides  his  fund  between  the
two  components as  calculated  above  the  aggregate  return  from
both parts should be about 78 before taxes or 55 on a taxfree
or estimated taxpaid basis a return of this order is appreciably
higher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over
most of the longterm past it may not seem attractive in relation to
the  14  or  so  return  shown  by  common  stocks  during  the  20
years of the predominantly bull market after 1949 but it should be
remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the djia had
advanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had
about  doubled  hence  the  greater  part  of  the  impressive  market
record  for  that  period  was  based  on  a  change  in  investors  and
speculators  attitudes  rather  than  in  underlying  corporate  values
to that extent it might well be called a bootstrap operation

in  discussing  the  commonstock  portfolio  of  the  defensive
investor  we  have  spoken  only  of  leading  issues  of  the  type
included in the 30 components of the dow jones industrial aver
age we have done this for convenience and not to imply that these
30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him actually there are
many other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average
of the dow jones list these would include a host of public utilities
which have a separate dow jones average to represent them but

 today  the  most  widely  available  alternatives  to  the  dow  jones  industrial
average are the standard  poors 500stock index the s  p and the
wilshire 5000 index the s  p focuses on 500 large wellknown compa
nies that make up roughly 70 of the total value of the us equity market
the  wilshire  5000  follows  the  returns  of  nearly  every  significant  publicly

28

the intelligent investor

the major point here is that the defensive investors overall results
are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep
resentative  list  than  from  another  ormore  accuratelythat  nei
ther  he  nor  his  advisers  could  predict  with  certainty  whatever
differences would ultimately develop it is true that the art of skill
ful  or  shrewd  investment  is  supposed  to  lie  particularly  in  the
selection of issues that will give better results than the general mar
ket for reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the
ability  of  defensive  investors  generally  to  get  better  than  average
resultswhich in fact would mean to beat their own overall per
formance  our  skepticism  extends  to  the  management  of  large
funds by experts

let us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem
to prove the opposite between december 1960 and december 1970
the djia advanced from 616 to 839 or 36 but in the same period
the  much  larger  standard    poors  weighted  index  of  500  stocks
rose from 5811 to 9215 or 58 obviously the second group had
proved a better buy than the first but who would have been so
rash  as  to  predict  in  1960  that  what  seemed  like  a  miscellaneous
assortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper
form the aristocratic thirty tyrants of the dow all this proves
we  insist  that  only  rarely  can  one  make  dependable  predictions
about price changes absolute or relative

we shall repeat here without apologyfor the warning cannot
be  given  too  oftenthat  the  investor  cannot  hope  for  better  than
average  results  by  buying  new  offerings  or  hot  issues  of  any
sort meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit the
contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run the defensive
investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies
with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial
condition any security analyst worth his salt could make up such

traded stock in america roughly 6700 in all but since the largest compa
nies  account  for  most  of  the  total  value  of  the  index  the  return  of  the
wilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the s  p 500 several low
cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a
single convenient portfolio see chapter 9

a  list  aggressive  investors  may  buy  other  types  of  common
stocks but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab
lished by intelligent analysis

to conclude this section let us mention briefly three supplemen
tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor the first is the
purchase of the shares of wellestablished investment funds as an
alternative to creating his own commonstock portfolio he might
also  utilize  one  of  the  common  trust  funds  or  commingled
funds operated by trust companies and banks in many states or
if his funds are substantial use the services of a recognized invest
mentcounsel firm this will give him professional administration
of  his  investment  program  along  standard  lines  the  third  is  the
device  of  dollarcost  averaging  which  means  simply  that  the
practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
each month or each quarter in this way he buys more shares when
the market is low than when it is high and he is likely to end up
with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings strictly speak
ing this method is an application of a broader approach known as
formula investing the latter was already alluded to in our sug
gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks
between the 25 minimum and the 75 maximum in inverse rela
tionship to the action of the market these ideas have merit for the
defensive investor and they will be discussed more amply in later
chapters

results to be expected by the aggressive investor

our  enterprising  security  buyer  of  course  will  desire  and
expect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive
companion but first he must make sure that his results will not be
worse it is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy study
and native ability into wall street and to end up with losses instead
of  profits  these  virtues  if  channeled  in  the  wrong  directions
become indistinguishable from handicaps thus it is most essential
that  the  enterprising  investor  start  with  a  clear  conception  as  to

 for  more  advice  on  wellestablished  investment  funds  see  chapter  9
professional  administration  by  a  recognized  investmentcounsel  firm  is
discussed in chapter 10 dollarcost averaging is explained in chapter 5

30

the intelligent investor

which  courses  of  action  offer  reasonable  chances  of  success  and
which do not

first let us consider several ways in which investors and specu
lators  generally  have  endeavored  to  obtain  better  than  average
results these include

1 trading  in  the  market this  usually  means  buying  stocks
when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has
turned downward the stocks selected are likely to be among those
which  have  been  behaving  better  than  the  market  average  a
small  number  of  professionals  frequently  engage  in  short  selling
here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the
established  mechanism  of  the  stock  exchanges  their  object  is  to
benefit  from  a  subsequent  decline  in  the  price  of  these  issues  by
buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for as our
quotation  from  the  wall  street  journal on  p  19  indicates  even
small investorsperish the termsometimes try their unskilled
hand at short selling

2 shortterm selectivity this means buying stocks of compa
nies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings
or for which some other favorable development is anticipated

3 longterm  selectivity  here  the  usual  emphasis  is  on  an
excellent record of past growth which is considered likely to con
tinue in the future in some cases also the investor may choose
companies  which  have  not  yet  shown  impressive  results  but  are
expected to establish a high earning power later such companies
belong  frequently  in  some  technological  areaeg  computers
drugs  electronicsand  they  often  are  developing  new  processes
or products that are deemed to be especially promising

we have already expressed a negative view about the investors
overall  chances  of  success  in  these  areas  of  activity  the  first  we
have ruled out on both theoretical and realistic grounds from the
domain of investment stock trading is not an operation which on
thorough  analysis  offers  safety  of  principal  and  a  satisfactory
return more will be said on stock trading in a later chapter

 see chapter 8

investment versus speculation

31

in his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the
near term or the longer future the investor faces obstacles of two
kindsthe  first  stemming  from  human  fallibility  and  the  second
from  the  nature  of  his  competition  he  may  be  wrong  in  his  esti
mate of the future or even if he is right the current market price
may  already  fully  reflect  what  he  is  anticipating  in  the  area  of
nearterm selectivity the current years results of the company are
generally common property on wall street next years results to
the extent they are predictable are already being carefully consid
ered hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of
this years superior results or on what he is told he may expect for
next year is likely to find that others have done the same thing for
the same reason

in  choosing  stocks  for  their  longterm prospects  the  investors
handicaps are basically the same the possibility of outright error
in the predictionwhich we illustrated by our airlines example on
p 6is no doubt greater than when dealing with nearterm earn
ings because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts it is
theoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making
correct predictions when wall street as a whole is making incorrect
ones but that is only theoretical how many enterprising investors
could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro
fessional  analysts  at  their  favorite  game  of  estimating  longterm
future earnings

we are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu
sion to enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average
results the investor must follow policies which are 1 inherently
sound and promising and 2 not popular on wall street

are  there  any  such  policies  available  for  the  enterprising
investor in theory once again the answer should be yes and there
are broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in
practice  as  well  everyone  knows  that  speculative  stock  move
ments are carried too far in both directions frequently in the gen
eral  market  and  at  all  times  in  at  least  some  of  the  individual
issues furthermore a common stock may be undervalued because
of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice we can go fur
ther  and  assert  that  in  an  astonishingly  large  proportion  of  the
trading in common stocks those engaged therein do not appear to
knowin polite termsone part of their anatomy from another in
this  book  we  shall  point  out  numerous  examples  of  past  dis

32

the intelligent investor

crepancies between price and value thus it seems that any intelli
gent person with a good head for figures should have a veritable
picnic on wall street battening off other peoples foolishness so it
seems but somehow it does not work out that simply buying a neg
lected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves
a  protracted  and  patiencetrying  experience  and  selling  short  a
too popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not
only  of  ones  courage  and  stamina  but  also  of  the  depth  of  ones
pocketbook  the  principle  is  sound  its  successful  application  is
not impossible but it is distinctly not an easy art to master

there is also a fairly wide group of special situations which
over many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return
of 20 or better with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew
their  way  around  in  this  field  they  include  intersecurity  arbi
trages  payouts  or  workouts  in  liquidations  protected  hedges  of
certain kinds the most typical case is a projected merger or acqui
sition  which  offers  a  substantially  higher  value  for  certain  shares
than their price on the date of the announcement the number of
such  deals  increased  greatly  in  recent  years  and  it  should  have
been  a  highly  profitable  period  for  the  cognoscenti  but  with  the
multiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of
obstacles  to  mergers  and  of  deals  that  did not  go  through  quite  a
few  individual  losses  were  thus  realized  in  these  oncereliable
operations perhaps too the overall rate of profit was diminished
by too much competition

 in  selling  short  or  shorting  a  stock  you  make  a  bet  that  its  share 
price will go down not up shorting is a threestep process first you bor
row  shares  from  someone  who  owns  them  then  you  immediately  sell  the
borrowed shares finally you replace them with shares you buy later if the
stock  drops  you  will  be  able  to  buy  your  replacement  shares  at  a  lower
price  the  difference  between  the  price  at  which  you  sold  your  borrowed
shares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit
reduced by dividend or interest charges along with brokerage costs how
ever  if  the  stock  goes  up  in  price  instead  of  down  your  potential  loss  is
unlimitedmaking short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual
investors
 in the late 1980s as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts
multiplied wall street set up institutional arbitrage desks to profit from any

investment versus speculation

33

the lessened profitability of these special situations appears one
manifestation of a kind of selfdestructive processakin to the law
of diminishing returnswhich has developed during the lifetime
of this book in 1949 we could present a study of stockmarket fluc
tuations over the preceding 75 years which supported a formula
based  on  earnings  and  current  interest  ratesfor  determining  a
level  to  buy  the  djia below  its  central  or  intrinsic  value 
and to sell out above such value it was an application of the gov
erning maxim of the rothschilds buy cheap and sell dear and
it had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained
and pernicious maxim of wall street that stocks should be bought
because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down
alas after 1949 this formula no longer worked a second illustra
tion  is  provided  by  the  famous  dow  theory  of  stockmarket
movements  in  a  comparison  of  its  indicated  splendid  results  for
18971933  and  its  much  more  questionable  performance  since
1934

a third  and  final  example  of  the  golden  opportunities  not
recently  available  a good  part  of  our  own  operations  on  wall
street had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issues eas
ily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than
their  share  in  the  net  current  assets  working  capital  alone  not
counting the plant account and other assets and after deducting all
liabilities ahead of the stock it is clear that these issues were selling
at a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi
ness no proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what
he owned at so ridiculously low a figure strangely enough such

errors in pricing these complex deals they became so good at it that the
easy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down
although graham does discuss it again see pp 174175 this sort of trad
ing  is  no  longer  feasible  or  appropriate  for  most  people  since  only  multi
milliondollar  trades  are  large  enough  to  generate  worthwhile  profits
wealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge
funds that specialize in merger or event arbitrage

power  in  european  investment  banking  and  brokerage  in  the  nineteenth
century for a brilliant history see niall ferguson the house of rothschild

the intelligent investor

anomalies were not hard to find in 1957 a list was published show
ing nearly 200 issues of this type available in the market in various
ways practically all these bargain issues turned out to be profitable
and  the  average  annual  result  proved  much  more  remunerative
than  most  other  investments  but  they  too  virtually  disappeared
from the stock market in the next decade and with them a depend
able area for shrewd and successful operation by the enterprising
investor however at the low prices of 1970 there again appeared a
considerable  number  of  such  subworkingcapital  issues  and
despite  the  strong  recovery  of  the  market  enough  of  them
remained at the end of the year to make up a fullsized portfolio

the enterprising investor under todays conditions still has vari
ous possibilities of achieving better than average results the huge
list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be
identified  as  undervalued  by  logical  and  reasonably  dependable
standards  these  should  yield  more  satisfactory  results  on  the
average  than  will  the  djia or  any  similarly  representative  list  in
our  view  the  search  for  these  would  not  be  worth  the  investors
effort unless he could hope to add say 5 before taxes to the aver
age annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio we shall
try to develop one or more such approaches to stock selection for
use by the active investor

grahams  definition  of  investing  could  not  be  clearer  an  invest

of principal and an adequate return 1 note that investing according to
graham consists equally of three elements






you must thoroughly analyze a company and the soundness of its
underlying businesses before you buy its stock
you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
you must aspire to adequate not extraordinary performance

1 graham goes even further fleshing out each of the key terms in his defini
tion thorough analysis means the study of the facts in the light of estab
lished  standards  of  safety  and  value  while  safety  of  principal  signifies
protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or

commentary on chapter 1

an investor calculates what a stock is worth based on the value of
its businesses a speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price
because  somebody  else  will  pay  even  more  for  it  as  graham  once
put it investors judge the market price by established standards of
value  while  speculators  base  their  standards  of  value  upon  the
market price 2 for a speculator the incessant stream of stock quotes
is  like  oxygen  cut  it  off  and  he  dies  for  an  investor  what  graham
called  quotational  values  matter  much  less  graham  urges  you  to
invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had
no way of knowing its daily share price3

like casino gambling or betting on the horses speculating in the
market can be exciting or even rewarding if you happen to get lucky
but its the worst imaginable way to build your wealth that is because
wall street like las vegas or the racetrack has calibrated the odds
so  that  the  house  always  prevails  in  the  end  against  everyone  who
tries to beat the house at its own speculative game

on the other hand investing is a unique kind of casinoone where
you cannot lose in the end so long as you play only by the rules that
put the odds squarely in your favor people who invest make money for
themselves people who speculate make money for their brokers and
that  in  turn  is  why  wall  street  perennially  downplays  the  durable
virtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation

confusing  speculation  with  investment  graham  warns  is  always  a

period  no  matter  how  dangerous  or  dumb  their  tactics  people
boasted that they were right but the intelligent investor has no inter
est in being temporarily right to reach your longterm financial goals
you  must  be  sustainably  and  reliably  right  the  techniques  that
became so trendy in the 1990sday trading ignoring diversification
flipping hot mutual funds following stockpicking systemsseemed
to work but they had no chance of prevailing in the long run because
they failed to meet all three of grahams criteria for investing

to see why temporarily high returns do not prove anything imagine
that  two  places  are  130  miles  apart  if  i  observe  the  65mph  speed
limit i can drive that distance in two hours but if i drive 130 mph i
can get there in one hour if i try this and survive am i right should
you  be  tempted  to  try  it  too  because  you  hear  me  bragging  that  it
worked  flashy  gimmicks  for  beating  the  market  are  much  the
same in short streaks so long as your luck holds out they work over
time they will get you killed

in  1973  when  graham  last  revised  the  intelligent  investor the
annual  turnover  rate  on  the  new  york  stock  exchange  was  20
meaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before
selling it by 2002 the turnover rate had hit 105a holding period of
only 114 months back in 1973 the average mutual fund held on to a
stock  for  nearly  three  years  by  2002  that  ownership  period  had
shrunk  to  just  109  months  its  as  if  mutualfund  managers  were
studying  their  stocks  just  long  enough  to  learn  they  should not  have
bought them in the first place then promptly dumping them and start
ing all over

even  the  most  respected  moneymanagement  firms  got  antsy  in
early  1995  jeffrey  vinik  manager  of  fidelity  magellan  then  the
worlds  largest  mutual  fund  had  425  of  its  assets  in  technology
stocks vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders have invested
in the fund for goals that are years away    i think their objectives are
the  same  as  mine  and  that  they  believe  as  i  do  that  a  longterm
approach  is  best  but  six  months  after  he  wrote  those  highminded
words vinik sold off almost all his technology shares unloading nearly
19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks so much for the long term
and by 1999 fidelitys discount brokerage division was egging on its
clients to trade anywhere anytime using a palm handheld computer
which was perfectly in tune with the firms new slogan every second
counts

but  trading  as  if  your  underpants  are  on  fire  is  not  the  only  form  of
speculation  throughout  the  past  decade  or  so  one  speculative  for
mula after another was promoted popularized and then thrown aside
all of them shared a few traitsthis is quick this is easy and it will not
hurt a bitand all of them violated at least one of grahams distinc
tions between investing and speculating here are a few of the trendy
formulas that fell flat



cash  in  on  the  calendar the  january  effectthe  tendency  of
small  stocks  to  produce  big  gains  around  the  turn  of  the  year
was widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub
lished in the 1980s these studies showed that if you piled into
small stocks in the second half of december and held them into
january  you  would  beat  the  market  by  five  to  10  percentage
points  that  amazed  many  experts  after  all  if  it  were  this  easy
surely  everyone  would  hear  about  it  lots  of  people  would  do  it
and the opportunity would wither away

what caused the january jolt first of all many investors sell
their crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can
cut  their  tax  bills  second  professional  money  managers  grow
more cautious as the year draws to a close seeking to preserve
their  outperformance  or  minimize  their  underperformance  that
makes them reluctant to buy or even hang on to a falling stock
and  if  an  underperforming  stock  is  also  small  and  obscure  a
money manager will be even less eager to show it in his yearend

9 in 2000 and 2001 amazoncom and qualcomm lost a cumulative total of
858 and 713 of their value respectively

commentary on chapter 1

list of holdings all these factors turn small stocks into momentary
bargains when the taxdriven selling ceases in january they typi
cally bounce back producing a robust and rapid gain

the january effect has not withered away but it has weakened
according to finance professor william schwert of the university of
rochester if you had bought small stocks in late december and
sold them in early january you would have beaten the market by 85
percentage  points  from  1962  through  1979  by  44  points  from
1980 through 1989 and by 58 points from 1990 through 200110
as more people learned about the january effect more traders
bought small stocks in december making them less of a bargain
and thus reducing their returns also the january effect is biggest
among  the  smallest  stocksbut  according  to  plexus  group  the
leading authority on brokerage expenses the total cost of buying
and  selling  such  tiny  stocks  can  run  up  to  8  of  your  invest
ment11 sadly by the time you are done paying your broker all your
gains on the january effect will melt away
just  do  what  works in  1996  an  obscure  money  manager
named  james  oshaughnessy  published  a  book  called  what
works  on  wall  street
in  it  he  argued  that  investors  can  do
much  better than  the  market  oshaughnessy  made  a  stunning
claim from 1954 through 1994 you could have turned 10000
into 8074504 beating the market by more than 10folda tow
ering 182 average annual return how by buying a basket of
50 stocks with the highest oneyear returns five straight years of
rising earnings and share prices less than 15 times their corpo
rate  revenues12 as  if  he  were  the  edison  of  wall  street
oshaughnessy obtained us patent no 5978778 for his auto
mated  strategies  and  launched  a  group  of  four  mutual  funds
based on his findings by late 1999 the funds had sucked in more
than  175  million  from  the  publicand  in  his  annual  letter  to
shareholders oshaughnessy stated grandly as always i hope

overall stock market as measured by the s  p 500 index wal
loped every oshaughnessy fund almost nonstop for nearly four
years running

in june 2000 oshaughnessy moved closer to his own long
term goals by turning the funds over to a new manager leaving
his  customers  to  fend  for  themselves  with  those  timetested
investment  strategies 13 oshaughnessys  shareholders  might
have  been  less  upset  if  he  had  given  his  book  a  more  precise
titlefor instance what used to work on wall street    until i
wrote this book
follow  the  foolish  four in  the  mid1990s  the  motley  fool
website  and  several  books  hyped  the  daylights  out  of  a  tech
nique called the foolish four according to the motley fool you
would have trashed the market averages over the last 25 years
and could crush your mutual funds by spending only 15 min
utes a year on planning your investments best of all this tech
nique had minimal risk all you needed to do was this



1 take the five stocks in the dow jones industrial average with

the lowest stock prices and highest dividend yields

2 discard the one with the lowest price
3 put 40 of your money in the stock with the secondlowest

price

4 put 20 in each of the three remaining stocks
5 one  year  later  sort  the  dow  the  same  way  and  reset  the

portfolio according to steps 1 through 4

6 repeat until wealthy

over a 25year period the motley fool claimed this technique
would have beaten the market by a remarkable 101 percentage

13 in  a  remarkable  irony  the  surviving  two  oshaughnessy  funds  now
known  as  the  hennessy  funds  began  performing  quite  well  just  as
oshaughnessy  announced  that  he  was  turning  over  the  management  to
another company the funds shareholders were furious in a chat room at

points  annually  over  the  next  two  decades  they  suggested
20000  invested  in  the  foolish  four  should  flower  into
1791000 and they claimed you could do still better by pick
ing the five dow stocks with the highest ratio of dividend yield to
the square root of stock price dropping the one that scored the
highest and buying the next four

let us  consider  whether  this  strategy  could  meet  grahams

definitions of an investment

 what  kind  of  thorough  analysis  could  justify  discarding  the
stock  with  the  single  most  attractive  price  and  dividendbut
keeping the four that score lower for those desirable qualities
 how could putting 40 of your money into only one stock be a

minimal risk

 and  how  could  a  portfolio  of  only  four  stocks  be  diversified

enough to provide safety of principal

the  foolish  four  in  short  was  one  of  the  most  cockamamie
stockpicking formulas ever concocted the fools made the same
mistake as oshaughnessy if you look at a large quantity of data
long  enough  a  huge  number  of  patterns  will  emergeif  only  by
chance  by  random  luck  alone  the  companies  that  produce
aboveaverage stock returns will have plenty of things in common
but  unless  those  factors  because the  stocks  to  outperform  they
cannot be used to predict future returns

none  of  the  factors  that  the  motley  fools  discovered  with
such fanfaredropping the stock with the best score doubling up
on the one with the secondhighest score dividing the dividend
yield  by  the  square  root  of  stock  pricecould  possibly  because  or
explain the future performance of a stock money magazine found
that  a  portfolio  made  up  of  stocks  whose  names  contained  no
repeating  letters  would  have  performed  nearly  as  well  as  the
foolish fourand for the same reason luck alone14 as graham
never  stops  reminding  us  stocks  do  well  or  poorly  in  the  future
because the businesses behind them do well or poorlynothing
more and nothing less

sure enough instead of crushing the market the foolish four
crushed the thousands of people who were fooled into believing
that  it  was  a  form  of  investing  in  2000  alone  the  four  foolish
stockscaterpillar eastman kodak sbc and general motors
lost 14 while the dow dropped by just 47

as these examples show there is only one thing that never suffers a
bear  market  on  wall  street  dopey  ideas  each  of  these  socalled
investing approaches fell prey to grahams law all mechanical formu
las for earning higher stock performance are a kind of selfdestructive
processakin to the law of diminishing returns there are two reasons
the returns fade away if the formula was just based on random statis
tical  flukes  like  the  foolish  four  the  mere  passage  of  time  will
expose that it made no sense in the first place on the other hand if
the formula actually did work in the past like the january effect then
by publicizing it market pundits always erodeand usually eliminate
its ability to do so in the future

all  this  reinforces  grahams  warning  that  you  must  treat  specula

tion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino







you must never delude yourself into thinking that you are investing
when you are speculating
speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin
to take it seriously
you must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager

just as sensible gamblers take say 100 down to the casino floor
and leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room
the intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as
a mad money account for most of us 10 of our overall wealth is
the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk never min
gle the money in your speculative account with what is in your invest
ment accounts never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into
your investing activities and never put more than 10 of your assets
into your mad money account no matter what happens

for better or worse the gambling instinct is part of human nature
so its futile for most people even to try suppressing it but you must
confine and restrain it that is the single best way to make sure you will
never fool yourself into confusing speculation with investment

chapter 2

the investor and inflation

inflation  and  the  fight  against  it  has  been  very  much  in  the
publics  mind  in  recent  years  the  shrinkage  in  the  purchasing
power of the dollar in the past and particularly the fear or hope
by  speculators  of  a  serious  further  decline  in  the  future  has
greatly influenced the thinking of wall street it is clear that those
with  a  fixed  dollar  income  will  suffer  when  the  cost  of  living
advances and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi
pal holders of stocks on the other hand have the possibility that a
loss of the dollars purchasing power may be offset by advances in
their dividends and the prices of their shares

on the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities
have concluded that 1 bonds are an inherently undesirable form
of  investment  and  2  consequently  common  stocks  are  by  their
very  nature  more  desirable  investments  than  bonds  we  have
heard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios
should consist 100 of stocks and zero percent of bonds this is
quite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were

 by the late 1990s this advicewhich can be appropriate for a foundation
or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizonhad spread to indi
vidual investors whose life spans are finite in the 1994 edition of his influ
ential book stocks for the long run finance professor jeremy siegel of the
wharton  school  recommended  that  risktaking  investors  should  buy  on
margin borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135 of their
assets into stocks even government officials got in on the act in february
1999  the  honorable  richard  dixon  state  treasurer  of  maryland  told  the
audience at an investment conference it does not make any sense for any
one to have any money in a bond fund

the intelligent investor

restricted by law to highgrade bonds and a few choice preferred
stocks

our  readers  must  have  enough  intelligence  to  recognize  that
even  highquality  stocks  cannot  be  a  better  purchase  than  bonds
under  all  conditionsie  regardless  of  how  high  the  stock  market
may be and how low the current dividend return compared with
the rates available on bonds a statement of this kind would be as
absurd as was the contrary onetoo often heard years agothat
any  bond  is  safer  than  any  stock  in  this  chapter  we  shall  try  to
apply  various  measurements  to  the  inflation  factor  in  order  to
reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may
wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the
price level

in this matter as in so many others in finance we must base our
views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience is infla
tion something new for this country at least in the serious form it
has taken since 1965 if we have seen comparable or worse infla
tions in living experience what lessons can be learned from them
in confronting the inflation of today let us start with table 21 a
condensed  historical  tabulation  that  contains  much  information
about changes in the general price level and concomitant changes
in  the  earnings  and  market  value  of  common  stocks  our  figures
will  begin  with  1915  and  thus  cover  55  years  presented  at  five
year intervals we use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of
wartime price controls

the  first  thing  we  notice  is  that  we  have  had  inflation  in  the
pastlots  of  it  the  largest  fiveyear  dose  was  between  1915  and
1920 when the cost of living nearly doubled this compares with
the advance of 15 between 1965 and 1970 in between we have
had  three  periods  of  declining  prices  and  then  six  of  advances  at
varying  rates  some  rather  small  on  this  showing  the  investor
should clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent
inflation to come

can  we  tell  what  the  rate  of  inflation  is  likely  to  be  no  clear
answer is suggested by our table it shows variations of all sorts it
would seem sensible however to take our cue from the rather con
sistent record of the past 20 years the average annual rise in the
consumer  price  level  for  this  period  has  been  25  that  for
19651970 was 45 that for 1970 alone was 54 official govern

the intelligent investor

ment  policy  has  been  strongly  against  largescale  inflation  and
there are some reasons to believe that federal policies will be more
effective in the future than in recent years we think it would be
reasonable  for  an  investor  at  this  point  to  base  his  thinking  and
decisions on a probable far from certain rate of future inflation of
say  3  per  annum  this  would  compare  with  an  annual  rate  of
about 212 for the entire period 191519701

what would be the implications of such an advance it would
eat  up  in  higher  living  costs  about  onehalf  the  income  now
obtainable on good mediumterm taxfree bonds or our assumed
aftertax equivalent from highgrade corporate bonds this would
be a serious shrinkage but it should not be exaggerated it would
not  mean  that  the  true  value  or  the  purchasing  power  of  the
investors fortune need be reduced over the years if he spent half
his  interest  income  after  taxes  he  would  maintain  this  buying
power intact even against a 3 annual inflation

but the next question naturally is can the investor be reason
ably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than
highgrade bonds even at the unprecedented rate of return offered
in  19701971  would  not  for  example  an  allstock  program  be
preferable  to  a  partbond  partstock  program  do  not  common
stocks have a builtin protection against inflation and are they not
almost  certain  to  give  a  better  return  over  the  years  than  will
bonds have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than
have bonds over the 55year period of our study

the answer to these questions is somewhat complicated com
mon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period
of time in the past the rise of the djia from an average of 77 in
1915  to  an  average  of  753  in  1970  works  out  at  an  annual  com
pounded rate of just about 4 to which we may add another 4
for  average  dividend  return  the  corresponding  figures  for  the 
s  p composite are about the same these combined figures of 8

 this is one of grahams rare misjudgments in 1973 just two years after
president  richard  nixon  imposed  wage  and  price  controls  inflation  hit
87 its highest level since the end of world war ii the decade from 1973
through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern american history as the
cost of living more than doubled

per  year  are  of  course  much  better  than  the  return  enjoyed  from
bonds  over  the  same  55year  period  but  they  do  not  exceed  that
now offered by highgrade bonds this brings us to the next logical
question  is  there  a  persuasive  reason  to  believe  that  common
stocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in
the last five and onehalf decades

our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no common
stocks may do better in the future than in the past but they are far
from  certain  to  do  so  we  must  deal  here  with  two  different  time
elements  in  investment  results  the  first  covers  what  is  likely  to
occur over the longterm futuresay the next 25 years the second
applies to what is likely to happen to the investorboth financially
and psychologicallyover short or intermediate periods say five
years or less his frame of mind his hopes and apprehensions his
satisfaction or discontent with what he has done above all his deci
sions  what  to  do  next  are  all  determined  not  in  the  retrospect  of 
a  lifetime  of  investment  but  rather  by  his  experience  from  year 
to year

on this point we can be categorical there is no close time con
nection  between  inflationary  or  deflationary  conditions  and  the
movement  of  commonstock  earnings  and  prices  the  obvious
example is the recent period 19661970 the rise in the cost of liv
ing was 22 the largest in a fiveyear period since 19461950 but
both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since
1965  there  are  similar  contradictions  in  both  directions  in  the
record of previous fiveyear periods

inflation and corporate earnings

another  and  highly  important  approach  to  the  subject  is  by  a
study of the earnings rate on capital shown by american business
this  has  fluctuated  of  course  with  the  general  rate  of  economic
activity  but  it  has  shown  no  general  tendency  to  advance  with
wholesale prices or the cost of living actually this rate has fallen
rather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of
the period to some degree the decline was due to the charging of
more liberal depreciation rates see table 22 our extended stud
ies  have  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  investor  cannot  count  on
much above the recent fiveyear rate earned on the djia group

about 10 on net tangible assets book value behind the shares2
since  the  market  value  of  these  issues  is  well  above  their  book
valuesay 900 market vs 560 book in mid1971the earnings on
current  market  price  work  out  only  at  some  614  this  relation
ship  is  generally  expressed  in  the  reverse  or  times  earnings
mannereg that the djia price of 900 equals 18 times the actual
earnings for the 12 months ended june 1971

our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous
chapter that the investor may assume an average dividend return
of about 35 on the market value of his stocks plus an apprecia
tion  of  say  4  annually  resulting  from  reinvested  profits  note
that each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase
the market price by about 160

the reader will object that in the end our calculations make no
allowance for an increase in commonstock earnings and values to
result  from  our  projected  3  annual  inflation  our  justification  is
the absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount
in the past has had any direct effect on reported pershare earnings
the cold figures demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings
of the djia unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately
large growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits if
inflation  had  operated  as  a  separate  favorable  factor  its  effect
would  have  been  to  increase  the  value  of  previously  existing
capital this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old
capital  and  therefore  on  the  old  and  new  capital  combined  but
nothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years during
which  the  wholesale  price  level  has  advanced  nearly  40  busi
ness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than
by  consumer  prices  the  only  way  that  inflation  can  add  to 
common  stock  values  is  by  raising  the  rate  of  earnings  on  cap
ital  investment  on  the  basis  of  the  past  record  this  has  not  been 
the case

in the economic cycles of the past good business was accompa
nied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices it
was  generally  felt  that  a  little  inflation  was  helpful  to  business
profits this view is not contradicted by the history of 19501970

 see p 25

the investor and inflation

which reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and
generally rising prices but the figures indicate that the effect of all
this on the earning power of commonstock capital equity capital
has been quite limited in fact it has not even served to maintain the
rate of earnings on the investment clearly there have been impor
tant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the
real profitability of american corporations as a whole perhaps the
most important of these have been 1 a rise in wage rates exceed
ing  the  gains  in  productivity  and  2  the  need  for  huge  amounts 
of  new  capital  thus  holding  down  the  ratio  of  sales  to  capital
employed

our figures in table 22 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited  our  corporations  and  their  shareholders  its  effect  has
been quite the opposite the most striking figures in our table are
those for the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969 it is
surprising how little attention has been paid by economists and by
wall  street  to  this  development  the  debt  of  corporations  has
expanded  nearly  fivefold  while  their  profits  before  taxes  a  little
more than doubled with the great rise in interest rates during this
period  it  is  evident  that  the  aggregate  corporate  debt  is  now  an

adverse economic factor of some magnitude and a real problem for
many individual enterprises note that in 1950 net earnings after
interest  but  before  income  tax  were  about  30  of  corporate  debt
while  in  1969  they  were  only  132  of  debt  the  1970  ratio  must
have been even less satisfactory in sum it appears that a signifi
cannot part of the 11 being earned on corporate equities as a whole
is accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing
4 or less after tax credit if our corporations had maintained the
debt ratio of 1950 their earnings rate on stock capital would have
fallen still lower in spite of the inflation

the  stock  market  has  considered  that  the  publicutility  enter
prises have been a chief victim of inflation being caught between a
great advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of
raising  the  rates  charged  under  the  regulatory  process  but  this
may be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of
electricity gas and telephone services have advanced so much less
than  the  general  price  index  puts  these  companies  in  a  strong
strategic position for the future3 they are entitled by law to charge
rates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital and
this will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has
in the inflations of the past

all  of  the  above  brings  us  back  to  our  conclusion  that  the
investor  has  no  sound  basis  for  expecting  more  than  an  average
overall  return  of  say  8  on  a  portfolio  of  djiatype  common
stocks  purchased  at  the  late  1971  price  level  but  even  if  these
expectations  should  prove  to  be  understated  by  a  substantial
amount  the  case  would  not  be  made  for  an  allstock  investment
program if there is one thing guaranteed for the future it is that
the earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio
will not grow at the uniform rate of 4 or any other figure in the
memorable words of the elder j p morgan they will fluctuate 
this means first that the commonstock buyer at todays prices

 john  pierpont  morgan  was  the  most  powerful  financier  of  the  late  nine
teenth and early twentieth centuries because of his vast influence he was
constantly asked what the stock market would do next morgan developed a
mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer it will fluctuate see jean

or tomorrowswill be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory
results therefrom over a period of years it took 25 years for gen
eral electric and the djia itself to recover the ground lost in the
19291932  debacle  besides  that  if  the  investor  concentrates  his
portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either
by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines this is particu
larly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur
ther inflation for then if another bull market comes along he will
take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall not as a
chance to cash in on his handsome profits but rather as a vindica
tion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying
common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low
the dividend return that way lies sorrow

alternatives to common stocks as inflation hedges

the standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust
their currency has been to buy and hold gold this has been against
the law for american citizens since 1935luckily for them in the
past  35  years  the  price  of  gold  in  the  open  market  has  advanced
from  35  per  ounce  to  48  in  early  1972a  rise  of  only  35  but
during  all  this  time  the  holder  of  gold  has  received  no  income
return  on  his  capital  and  instead  has  incurred  some  annual
expense for storage obviously he would have done much better
with his money at interest in a savings bank in spite of the rise in
the general price level

the nearcomplete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the
purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the abil
ity of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by
putting his money in things quite a few categories of valuable

 the  investment  philosopher  peter  l  bernstein  feels  that  graham  was
dead wrong about precious metals particularly gold which at least in the
years  after  graham  wrote  this  chapter  has  shown  a  robust  ability  to  out
pace inflation financial adviser william bernstein agrees pointing out that a
tiny allocation to a preciousmetals fund say 2 of your total assets is too
small  to  hurt  your  overall  returns  when  gold  does  poorly  but  when  gold
does well its returns are often so spectacularsometimes exceeding 100

objects  have  had  striking  advances  in  market  value  over  the
yearssuch  as  diamonds  paintings  by  masters  first  editions  of
books  rare  stamps  and  coins  etc  but  in  many  perhaps  most  of
these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the pre
carious or even the unreal about the quoted prices somehow it is
hard to think of paying 67500 for a us silver dollar dated 1804
but not even minted that year as an investment operation 4 we
acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area very few of our
readers will find the swimming safe and easy there

the outright ownership of real estate has long been considered
as a sound longterm investment carrying with it a goodly amount
of protection against inflation unfortunately realestate values are
also  subject  to  wide  fluctuations  serious  errors  can  be  made  in
location  price  paid  etc  there  are  pitfalls  in  salesmens  wiles
finally diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate
means  except  by  various  types  of  participations  with  others  and
with the special hazards that attach to new flotationsnot too dif
ferent from commonstock ownership this too is not our field all
we should say to the investor is be sure its yours before you go
into it

conclusion

naturally we return to the policy recommended in our previous
chapter just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor
cannot  afford  to  put  all  his  funds  into  one  basketneither  in  the
bond basket despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds
have recently offered nor in the stock basket despite the prospect
of continuing inflation

the more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income
therefrom  the  more  necessary  it  is  for  him  to  guard  against  the

in a yearthat it can all by itself set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter
ing however the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly with its
high storage and insurance costs instead seek out a welldiversified mutual
fund  specializing  in  the  stocks  of  preciousmetal  companies  and  charging
below 1 in annual expenses limit your stake to 2 of your total financial
assets or perhaps 5 if you are over the age of 65

unexpected  and  the  disconcerting  in  this  part  of  his  life  it  is
axiomatic  that  the  conservative  investor  should  seek  to  minimize
his risks we think strongly that the risks involved in buying say a
telephonecompany  bond  at  yields  of  nearly  712  are  much  less
than  those  involved  in  buying  the  djia at  900  or  any  stock  list
equivalent  thereto  but  the  possibility  of  largescale inflation
remains  and  the  investor  must  carry  some  insurance  against  it
there is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately
against such inflation but it should carry more protection than the
bond component

this is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition p 97

and we would write the same today

it must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common  stocks  at  these  levels  892  for  the  djia  for  reasons
already given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to
be  without  an  appreciable  proportion  of  common  stocks  in  his
portfolio  even  if  we  regard  them  as  the  lesser  of  two  evilsthe
greater being the risks in an allbond holding

inflation who cares about that 

after all the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged
less  than  22  between  1997  and  2002and  economists  believe
think  for
that  even  that  rockbottom  rate  may  be  overstated1
instance of how the prices of computers and home electronics have
plummetedand  how  the  quality  of  many  goods  has  risen  meaning
that  consumers  are  getting  better  value  for  their  money  in  recent
years the true rate of inflation in the united states has probably run
around  1  annuallyan  increase  so  infinitesimal  that  many  pundits
have proclaimed that inflation is dead 2

index that measures inflation maintains a comprehensive and helpful web

investigate whether the official rate of inflation is accurate estimated that it
has been overstated often by nearly two percentage points per year for the
commissions report see wwwssagovhistoryreportsboskinrpthtml many
investment  experts  now  feel  that  deflation  or  falling  prices  is  an  even
greater  threat  than  inflation  the  best  way  to  hedge  against  that  risk  is  by

there is another reason investors overlook the importance of inflation
what psychologists call the money illusion if you receive a 2 raise
in a year when inflation runs at 4 you will almost certainly feel better
than you will if you take a 2 pay cut during a year when inflation is
zero yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical
position2  worse  off  after  inflation  so  long  as  the  nominal or
absolute change is positive we view it as a good thingeven if the
real or afterinflation result is negative and any change in your own
salary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices
in the economy as a whole3 likewise investors were delighted to earn
11  on  bank  certificates  of  deposit  cds  in  1980  and  are  bitterly
disappointed  to  be  earning  only  around  2  in  2003even  though
they  were  losing  money  after  inflation  back  then  but  are  keeping  up
with  inflation  now  the  nominal  rate  we  earn  is  printed  in  the  banks
ads  and  posted  in  its  window  where  a  high  number  makes  us  feel
good but inflation eats away at that high number in secret instead of
taking out ads inflation just takes away our wealth that is why inflation
is  so  easy  to  overlookand  why  its  so  important  to  measure  your
investing success not just by what you make but by how much you
keep after inflation

more basically still the intelligent investor must always be on guard
against whatever is unexpected and underestimated there are three
good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead



as recently as 19731982 the united states went through one
of the most painful bursts of inflation in our history as measured
by  the  consumer  price  index  prices  more  than  doubled  over 
that  period  rising  at  an  annualized  rate  of  nearly  9  in  1979
alone  inflation  raged  at  133  paralyzing  the  economy  in  what
became known as stagflationand leading many commentators
to question whether america could compete in the global market

what then can the intelligent investor do to guard against inflation
the  standard  answer  is  buy  stocksbut  as  common  answers  so
often are it is not entirely true

figure 21 shows for each year from 1926 through 2002 the rela

tionship between inflation and stock prices

as you can see in years when the prices of consumer goods and
services fell as on the left side of the graph stock returns were terri
blewith the market losing up to 43 of its value8 when inflation shot
above 6 as in the years on the right end of the graph stocks also
stank the stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which
inflation  exceeded  6  the  average  return  for  those  14  years  was  a
measly 26

while mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs
of  their  own  raw  materials  on  to  customers  high  inflation  wreaks
havocforcing  customers  to  slash  their  purchases  and  depressing
activity throughout the economy

the  historical  evidence  is  clear  since  the  advent  of  accurate 
stockmarket  data  in  1926  there  have  been  64  fiveyear  periods 
ie  19261930  19271931  19281932  and  so  on  through
19982002 in 50 of those 64 fiveyear periods or 78 of the time
stocks outpaced inflation9 that is impressive but imperfect it means
that stocks failed to keep up with inflation about onefifth of the time

8 when  inflation  is  negative  it  is  technically  termed  deflation  regularly
falling  prices  may  at  first  sound  appealing  until  you  think  of  the  japanese
example prices have been deflating in japan since 1989 with real estate
and  the  stock  market  dropping  in  value  year  after  yeara  relentless  water

fortunately you can bolster your defenses against inflation by branch
ing out beyond stocks since graham last wrote two inflationfighters
have become widely available to investors

reits real  estate  investment  trusts  or  reits  pronounced
reets  are  companies  that  own  and  collect  rent  from  commercial
and  residential  properties10 bundled  into  realestate  mutual  funds
reits do a decent job of combating inflation the best choice is van
guard  reit  index  fund  other  relatively  lowcost  choices  include
cohen    steers  realty  shares  columbia  real  estate  equity  fund
and  fidelity  real  estate  investment  fund11 while  a  reit  fund  is
unlikely to be a foolproof inflationfighter in the long run it should give
you  some  defense  against  the  erosion  of  purchasing  power  without
hampering your overall returns

tips treasury  inflationprotected  securities  or  tips  are  us
government  bonds  first  issued  in  1997  that  automatically  go  up  in
value  when  inflation  rises  because  the  full  faith  and  credit  of  the
united  states  stands  behind  them  all  treasury  bonds  are  safe  from
the risk of default or nonpayment of interest but tips also guaran
tee that the value of your investment will not be eroded by inflation in
one easy package you insure yourself against financial loss and the
loss of purchasing power12

there  is  one  catch  however  when  the  value  of  your  tips  bond
rises as inflation heats up the internal revenue service regards that
increase in value as taxable incomeeven though it is purely a paper

10 thorough if sometimes outdated information on reits can be found at
wwwnareitcom
11 for  further  information  see  wwwvanguardcom  wwwcohenandsteers
com wwwcolumbiafundscom and wwwfidelitycom the case for investing
in a reit fund is weaker if you own a home since that gives you an inherent
stake in realestate ownership
12 a good introduction to tips can be found at wwwpublicdebttreasgov

commentary on chapter 2

gain unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price why does
this make sense to the irs the intelligent investor will remember the
wise  words  of  financial  analyst  mark  schweber  the  one  question
never to ask a bureaucrat is why  because of this exasperating tax
complication  tips  are  best  suited  for  a  taxdeferred  retirement
account like an ira keogh or 401k where they will not jack up your
taxable income

you  can  buy  tips  directly  from  the  us  government  at  www
publicdebttreasgovofofinflinhtm  or  in  a  lowcost  mutual  fund  like
vanguard  inflationprotected  securities  or  fidelity  inflationprotected
bond fund13 either directly or through a fund tips are the ideal sub
stitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise
keep in cash do not trade them tips can be volatile in the short run
so they work best as a permanent lifelong holding for most investors
allocating at least 10 of your retirement assets to tips is an intelli
gent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safeand entirely
beyond the reach of the long invisible claws of inflation

a century of stockmarket history 

the level of stock prices in early 1972

the investors portfolio of common stocks will represent a small
crosssection of that immense and formidable institution known as
the stock market prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea
of stockmarket history in terms particularly of the major fluctua
tions  in  its  price  level  and  of  the  varying  relationships  between
stock prices as a whole and their earnings and dividends with this
background  he  may  be  in  a  position  to  form  some  worthwhile
judgment of the attractiveness or dangers of the level of the market
as it presents itself at different times by a coincidence useful sta
tistical  data  on  prices  earnings  and  dividends  go  back  just  100
years to 1871 the material is not nearly as full or dependable in
the first halfperiod as in the second but it will serve in this chap
ter  we  shall  present  the  figures  in  highly  condensed  form  with
two  objects  in  view  the  first  is  to  show  the  general  manner  in
which  stocks  have  made  their  underlying  advance  through  the
many cycles of the past century the second is to view the picture
in  terms  of  successive  tenyear  averages  not  only  of  stock  prices
but  of  earnings  and  dividends  as  well  to  bring  out  the  varying
relationship between the three important factors with this wealth
of material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the
level of stock prices at the beginning of 1972

the longterm history of the stock market is summarized in two
tables and a chart table 31 sets forth the low and high points of
nineteen  bear  and  bullmarket  cycles  in  the  past  100  years  we
have used two indexes here the first represents a combination of
an  early  study  by  the  cowles  commission  going  back  to  1870
which  has  been  spliced  on  to  and  continued  to  date  in  the  well

known standard  poors composite index of 500 stocks the sec
ond is the even more celebrated dow jones industrial average the
djia or the dow which dates back to 1897 it contains 30 com
panies of which one is american telephone  telegraph and the
other 29 are large industrial enterprises1

chart i presented by courtesy of standard  poors depicts the
market  fluctuations  of  its  425industrialstock  index  from  1900
through  1970  a corresponding  chart  available  for  the  djia will
look very much the same the reader will note three quite distinct
patterns each covering about a third of the 70 years the first runs
from  1900  to  1924  and  shows  for  the  most  part  a  series  of  rather
similar market cycles lasting from three to five years the annual
advance in this period averaged just about 3 we move on to the
new era bull market culminating in 1929 with its terrible after
math  of  collapse  followed  by  quite  irregular  fluctuations  until
1949  comparing  the  average  level  of  1949  with  that  of  1924  we
find the annual rate of advance to be a mere 112 hence the close of
our second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for
common stocks by the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the
beginning  of  the  greatest  bull  market  in  our  history  presented  in
the last third of our chart this phenomenon may have reached its
culmination  in  december  1968  at  118  for  standard    poors  425
industrials  and  108  for  its  500stock  composite  as  table  31
shows there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968
especially  in  195657  and  196162  but  the  recoveries  therefrom
were  so  rapid  that  they  had  to  be  denominated  in  the  long
accepted  semantics  as  recessions  in  a  single  bull  market  rather
than  as  separate  market  cycles  between  the  low  level  of  162  for
the  dow  in  mid1949  and  the  high  of  995  in  early  1966  the
advance  had  been  more  than  sixfold  in  17  yearswhich  is  at  the
average compounded rate of 11 per year not counting dividends
of  say  312  per  annum  the  advance  for  the  standard    poors
composite  index  was  somewhat  greater  than  that  of  the  djia
actually from 14 to 96

these  14  and  better  returns  were  documented  in  1963  and
later in a much publicized study 2 it created a natural satisfaction

 the  study  in  its  final  form  was  lawrence  fisher  and  james  h  lorie
rates  of  return  on  investments  in  common  stock  the  yearbyyear

a century of stockmarket history

69

on wall street with such fine achievements and a quite illogical and
dangerous  conviction  that  equally  marvelous  results  could  be
expected for common stocks in the future few people seem to have
been bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might
indicate that it had been overdone the subsequent decline from the
1968 high to the 1970 low was 36 for the standard  poors com
posite and 37 for the djia the largest since the 44 suffered in
19391942  which  had  reflected  the  perils  and  uncertainties  after
pearl  harbor  in  the  dramatic  manner  so  characteristic  of  wall
street the low level of may 1970 was followed by a massive and
speedy recovery of both averages and the establishment of a new
alltime  high  for  the  standard    poors  industrials  in  early  1972
the annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out
at about 9 for the s  p composite or the industrial index using
the average figures for both years that rate of climb was of course
much greater than for any similar period before 1950 but in the last
decade  the  rate  of  advance  was  much  lower514  for  the  s    p
composite index and only the once familiar 3 for the djia

the record of price movements should be supplemented by cor
responding figures for earnings and dividends in order to provide
an overall view of what has happened to our share economy over
the ten decades we present a conspectus of this kind in our table
32 p 71 it is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study
all these figures with care but for some we hope they will be inter
esting and instructive

let  us  comment  on  them  as  follows  the  full  decade  figures
smooth  out  the  yeartoyear  fluctuations  and  leave  a  general  pic
ture  of  persistent  growth  only  two  of  the  nine  decades  after  the
first show a decrease in earnings and average prices in 18911900
and 19311940 and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver
age  dividends  but  the  rates  of  growth  in  all  three  categories  are
quite variable in general the performance since world war ii has
been  superior  to  that  of  earlier  decades  but  the  advance  in  the
1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s todays investor

record  192665  the  journal  of  business vol  xli  no  3  july  1968 
pp  291316  for  a  summary  of  the  studys  wide  influence  see  http
librarydfauscomreprintsworkofart

the intelligent investor

cannot tell from this record what percentage gain in earnings divi
dends and prices he may expect in the next ten years but it does
supply  all  the  encouragement  he  needs  for  a  consistent  policy  of
commonstock investment

however a point should be made here that is not disclosed in
our table the year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in
the overall earnings posture of our corporations the rate of profit
on  invested  capital  fell  to  the  lowest  percentage  since  the  world
war years equally striking is the fact that a considerable number
of companies reported net losses for the year many became finan
cially troubled and for the first time in three decades there were
quite  a  few  important  bankruptcy  proceedings  these  facts  as
much  as  any  others  have  prompted  the  statement  made  above
that the great boom era may have come to an end in 19691970

a striking  feature  of  table  32  is  the  change  in  the  priceearn
ings ratios since world war ii in june 1949 the s  p composite
index sold at only 63 times the applicable earnings of the past 12
months in march 1961 the ratio was 229 times similarly the divi
dend yield on the s  p index had fallen from over 7 in 1949 to
only  30  in  1961  a  contrast  heightened  by  the  fact  that  interest
rates  on  highgrade  bonds  had  meanwhile  risen  from  260  to
450  this  is  certainly  the  most  remarkable  turnabout  in  the
publics attitude in all stockmarket history

to people  of  long  experience  and  innate  caution  the  passage
from  one  extreme  to  another  carried  a  strong  warning  of  trou
ble  ahead  they  could  not  help  thinking  apprehensively  of  the
19261929 bull market and its tragic aftermath but these fears have
not been confirmed by the event true the closing price of the djia

 see pp 5052
 the priceearnings ratio of a stock or of a market average like the s  p
500stock index is a simple tool for taking the markets temperature if for
instance a company earned 1 per share of net income over the past year
and its stock is selling at 893 per share its priceearnings ratio would be
893 if however the stock is selling at 6970 then the priceearnings ratio
would be 697 in general a priceearnings ratio or pe ratio below 10 is
considered  low  between  10  and  20  is  considered  moderate  and  greater
than 20 is considered expensive for more on pe ratios see p 168

the intelligent investor

in 1970 was the same as it was 612 years earlier and the much her
alded soaring sixties proved to be mainly a march up a series of
high hills and then down again but nothing has happened either
to business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar
ket and depression of 19291932

the stockmarket level in early 1972

with  a  centurylong  conspectus  of  stock  prices  earnings  and
dividends  before  our  eyes  let  us  try  to  draw  some  conclusions
about the level of 900 for the djia and 100 for the s  p composite
index in january 1972

in each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the
stock market at the time of writing and endeavored to answer the
question  whether  it  was  too  high  for  conservative  purchase  the
reader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached
on  these  earlier  occasions  this  is  not  entirely  an  exercise  in  self
punishment it will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the
various stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also
a takenfromlife picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries
to reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev
els let us first reproduce the summary of the 1948 1953 and 1959
analyses that we gave in the 1965 edition

in  1948  we  applied  conservative  standards  to  the  dow  jones
level of 180 and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that
it  was  not  too  high  in  relation  to  underlying  values  when  we
approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that
year had reached 275 a gain of over 50 in five years we asked
ourselves the same questionnamely whether in our opinion the
level of 275 for the dow jones industrials was or was not too high
for sound investment in the light of the subsequent spectacular
advance it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no
means easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac
tiveness  of  the  1953  level  we  did  say  positively  enough  that
from  the  standpoint  of  value  indicationsour  chief  investment
guidethe conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable
but  we  were  concerned  about  the  fact  that  in  1953  the  averages
had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the

a century of stockmarket history

73

past and that its absolute level was historically high setting these
factors  against  our  favorable  value  judgment  we  advised  a  cau
tious or compromise policy as it turned out this was not a partic
ularly brilliant counsel a good prophet would have foreseen that
the  market  level  was  due  to  advance  an  additional  100  in  the
next five years perhaps we should add in selfdefense that few if
any  of  those  whose  business  was  stockmarket  forecastingas
ours  was  nothad  any  better  inkling  than  we  did  of  what  lay
ahead

at the beginning of 1959 we found the djia at an alltime high
of 584 our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be
summarized  in  the  following  from  page  59  of  the  1959  edition
in sum we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres
ent level of stock prices is a dangerous one it may well be perilous
because prices are already far too high but even if this is not the
case  the  markets  momentum  is  such  as  inevitably  to  carry  it  to
unjustifiable heights frankly we cannot imagine a market of the
future  in  which  there  will  never  be  any  serious  losses  and  in
which  every  tyro  will  be  guaranteed  a  large  profit  on  his  stock
purchases

the  caution  we  expressed  in  1959  was  somewhat  better  justi
fied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954 yet
it was far from fully vindicated the djia advanced to 685 in 1961
then  fell  a  little  below  our  584  level  to  566  later  in  the  year
advanced again to 735 in late 1961 and then declined in near panic
to 536 in may 1962 showing a loss of 27 within the brief period
of  six  months  at  the  same  time  there  was  a  far  more  serious
shrinkage in the most popular growth stocksas evidenced by
the striking fall of the indisputable leader international business
machines from a high of 607 in december 1961 to a low of 300 in
june 1962

this period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched
common  stocks  of  small  enterprisesthe  socalled  hot  issues
which  had  been  offered  to  the  public  at  ridiculously  high  prices
and then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to
levels little short of insane many of these lost 90 and more of the
quotations in just a few months

the  collapse  in  the  first  half  of  1962  was  disconcerting  if  not
disastrous  to  many  selfacknowledged  speculators  and  perhaps 

74

the intelligent investor

to  many  more  imprudent  people  who  called  themselves  in
vestors but the turnabout that came later that year was equally
unsuspected  by  the  financial  community  the  stockmarket  aver
ages  resumed  their  upward  course  producing  the  following
sequence

the  recovery  and  new  ascent  of  commonstock  prices  was
indeed  remarkable  and  created  a  corresponding  revision  of  wall
street  sentiment  at  the  low  level  of  june  1962  predictions  had
appeared predominantly bearish and after the partial recovery to
the end of that year they were mixed leaning to the skeptical side
but at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms
was  again  manifest  nearly  all  the  forecasts  were  on  the  bullish
side and they so continued through the 1964 advance

we then approached the task of appraising the november 1964
levels  of  the  stock  market  892  for  the  djia  after  discussing 
it  learnedly  from  numerous  angles  we  reached  three  main  con
clusions  the  first  was  that  old  standards  of  valuation  appear
inapplicable  new  standards  have  not  yet  been  tested  by  time 
the  second  was  that  the  investor  must  base  his  policy  on  the 
existence  of  major  uncertainties  the  possibilities  compass  the
extremes on the one hand of a protracted and further advance in
the markets levelsay by 50 or to 1350 for the djia or on the
other  hand  of  a  largely  unheralded  collapse  of  the  same  magni
tude  bringing  the  average  in  the  neighborhood  of  say  450 
p 63 the third was expressed in much more definite terms we
said speaking bluntly if the 1964 price level is not too high how
could  we  say  that  any price  level  is  too  high  and  the  chapter
closed as follows

a century of stockmarket history

75

what course to follow

investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan
gerous merely because they read it in this book they must weigh
our reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from
most competent and experienced people on wall street in the end
each  one  must  make  his  own  decision  and  accept  responsibility
therefor we suggest however that if the investor is in doubt as to
which course to pursue he should choose the path of caution the
principles of investment as set forth herein would call for the fol
lowing policy under 1964 conditions in order of urgency

1 no borrowing to buy or hold securities
2 no increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks
3 a reduction in commonstock holdings where needed to bring
it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio the
capitalgains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible
and  the  proceeds  invested  in  firstquality  bonds  or  held  as  a
savings deposit

investors who for some time have been following a bona fide
dollarcost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their
periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel
the market level is no longer dangerous we should advise rather
strongly against the initiation of a new dollaraveraging plan at the
late 1964 levels since many investors would not have the stamina
to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should
appear highly unfavorable

this time we can say that our caution was vindicated the djia
advanced  about  11  further  to  995  but  then  fell  irregularly  to  a
low of 632 in 1970 and finished that year at 839 the same kind of
debacle took place in the price of hot issuesie with declines
running as much as 90as had happened in the 196162 setback
and as pointed out in the introduction the whole financial picture
appeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and
greater  doubts a single  fact  may  summarize  the  story  the  djia
closed  1970  at  a  level  lower  than  six  years  beforethe  first  time
such a thing had happened since 1944

76

the intelligent investor

such were our efforts to evaluate former stockmarket levels is
there anything we and our readers can learn from them we con
sidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953
but too cautiously in the latter year dangerous in 1959 at 584
for djia and too high at 892 in 1964 all of these judgments
could be defended even today by adroit arguments but it is doubt
ful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counselsin
favor  of  a  consistent  and  controlled  commonstock  policy  on  the
one hand and discouraging endeavors to beat the market or to
pick the winners on the other

nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from
a renewed consideration of the level of the stock marketthis time
as of late 1971even if what we have to say will prove more inter
esting than practically useful or more indicative than conclusive
there is a fine passage near the beginning of aristotles ethics that
goes it is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of
exactness  which  the  nature  of  the  particular  subject  admits  it  is
equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a
mathematician  and  to  demand  strict  demonstration  from  an  ora
tor the work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle
between that of a mathematician and of an orator

at various times in 1971 the dow jones industrial average stood
at the 892 level of november 1964 that we considered in our previ
ous edition but in the present statistical study we have decided to
use the price level and the related data for the standard  poors
composite index or s  p 500 because it is more comprehensive
and  representative  of  the  general  market  than  the  30stock  djia
we shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four
dates of our former editionsnamely the yearends of 1948 1953
1958 and 1963plus 1968 for the current price level we shall take
the convenient figure of 100 which was registered at various times
in 1971 and in early 1972 the salient data are set forth in table 33
for  our  earnings  figures  we  present  both  the  last  years  showing
and the average of three calendar years for 1971 dividends we use
the  last  twelve  months  figures  and  for  1971  bond  interest  and
wholesale prices those of august 1971

the  3year  priceearnings  ratio  for  the  market  was  lower  in
october 1971 than at yearend 1963 and 1968 it was about the same
as in 1958 but much higher than in the early years of the long bull

the intelligent investor

market this important indicator taken by itself could not be con
strued  to  indicate  that  the  market  was  especially  high  in  january
1972 but when the interest yield on highgrade bonds is brought
into the picture the implications become much less favorable the
reader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns earn
ingsprice  to  bond  returns  has  grown  worse  during  the  entire
period so that the january 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks
by this criterion than in any of the previous years examined when
dividend  yields  are  compared  with  bond  yields  we  find  that  the
relationship  was  completely  reversed  between  1948  and  1972  in
the early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds now bonds
yield twice as much and more than stocks

our  final  judgment  is  that  the  adverse  change  in  the  bond
yieldstockyield ratio fully offsets the better priceearnings ratio
for late 1971 based on the 3year earnings figures hence our view
of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was
some 7 years agoie that it is an unattractive one from the stand
point of conservative investment this would apply to most of the
1971 price range of the djia between say 800 and 950

in terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still
appear  to  be  one  of  irregular  recovery  from  the  bad  setback  suf
fered  in  19691970  in  the  past  such  recoveries  have  ushered  in  a
new stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in
1949  this  was  the  expectation  of  wall  street  generally  during
1971 after the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of
lowgrade commonstock offerings in the 19681970 cycle it is too
early in 1971 for another twirl of the newissue merrygoround
hence  that  dependable  sign  of  imminent  danger  in  the  market  is
lacking  now  as  it  was  at  the  892  level  of  the  djia in  november
1964 considered in our previous edition technically then the out
look would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the
900 djia level before the next serious setback or collapse but we
cannot quite leave the matter there as perhaps we should to us
the early1971markets disregard of the harrowing experiences of
less than a year before is a disquieting sign can such heedlessness
go unpunished we think the investor must be prepared for diffi
cult  times  aheadperhaps  in  the  form  of  a  fairly  quick  replay  of
the the 19691970 decline or perhaps in the form of another bull
market fling to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse3

in  this  chapter  graham  shows  how  prophetic  he  can  be  he  looks 
two  years  ahead  foreseeing  the  catastrophic  bear  market  of
19731974  in  which  us  stocks  lost  37  of  their  value1 he  also
looks more than two decades into the future eviscerating the logic of
market gurus and bestselling books that were not even on the horizon
in his lifetime

the heart of grahams argument is that the intelligent investor must
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past unfortu
nately that is exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in
the 1990s a stream of bullish books followed wharton finance pro
fessor jeremy siegels stocks for the long run 1994culminating
in a wild crescendo with james glassman and kevin hassetts dow
36000 david  elias  dow  40000 and  charles  kadlecs  dow
100000 all published in 1999 forecasters argued that stocks had
returned  an  annual  average  of  7  after  inflation  ever  since  1802
therefore they concluded that is what investors should expect in the
future

some bulls went further since stocks had always beaten bonds
over  any  period  of  at  least  30  years  stocks  must  be  less  risky  than
bonds or even cash in the bank and if you can eliminate all the risk of
owning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough then why

1 if dividends are not included stocks fell 478 in those two years

at the kemper funds declared in the wall street journal its a

in the april 10 2000 issue of businessweek jeffrey m apple

asked  rhetorically  is  the  stock  market  riskier  today  than  two
years ago simply because prices are higher the answer is no



but the answer is yes it always has been it always will be
and  when  graham  asked  can  such  heedlessness  go  unpun
ished he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no like an
enraged  greek  god  the  stock  market  crushed  everyone  who  had
come  to  believe  that  the  high  returns  of  the  late  1990s  were  some
kind  of  divine  right  just  look  at  how  those  forecasts  by  landis
froelich and applegate held up

in april 2000 when applegate asked his rhetorical question the
dow jones industrials stood at 11187 the nasdaq composite
index was at 4446 by the end of 2002 the dow was hobbling
around the 8300 level while nasdaq had withered to roughly
1300eradicating all its gains over the previous six years

s you r v i v a l   o f   t h e   f a t t e s t

there was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have always
beaten bonds in the long run reliable figures before 1871 do
not exist the indexes used to represent the us stock markets
earliest  returns  contain  as  few  as  seven  yes  7  stocks1 by
1800  however  there  were  some  300  companies  in  america
many  in  the  jeffersonian  equivalents  of  the  internet  wooden
turnpikes and canals most went bankrupt and their investors
lost their knickers

but  the  stock  indexes  ignore  all  the  companies  that  went
bust in those early years a problem technically known as sur
vivorship  bias  thus  these  indexes  wildly  overstate  the  results
earned  by  reallife  investorswho  lacked  the  2020  hindsight
necessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy a lonely
handful of companies including bank of new york and j p mor
gan chase have prospered continuously since the 1790s but
for  every  such  miraculous  survivor  there  were  thousands  of
financial disasters like the dismal swamp canal co the penn
sylvania cultivation of vines co and the snickerss gap turn
pike coall omitted from the historical stock indexes

jeremy  siegels  data  show  that  after  inflation  from  1802
through  1870  stocks  gained  70  per  year  bonds  48  and
cash  51  but  elroy  dimson  and  his  colleagues  at  london
business  school  estimate  that  the  pre1871  stock  returns  are
overstated  by  at  least  two  percentage  points  per  year2 in  the
real world then stocks did no better than cash and bondsand
perhaps  a  bit  worse  anyone  who  claims  that  the  longterm
record  proves  that  stocks  are  guaranteed  to  outperform
bonds or cash is an ignoramus

1 by the 1840s these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan

cial stocks and 27 railroad stocksstill an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the

rambunctious young american stock market
2 see jason zweig new because for caution on stocks time may 6 2002
p 71 as graham hints on p 65 even the stock indexes between 1871 and

the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias thanks to the hundreds of automobile

too are probably overstated by one to two percentage points

as the enduring antidote to this kind of bullmarket baloney graham
urges the intelligent investor to ask some simple skeptical questions
why should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their
past  returns  when  every  investor  comes  to  believe  that  stocks  are
guaranteed to make money in the long run will not the market end up
being  wildly  overpriced  and  once  that  happens  how  can  future
returns possibly be high

grahams  answers  as  always  are  rooted  in  logic  and  common
sense the value of any investment is and always must be a function
of the price you pay for it by the late 1990s inflation was withering
away  corporate  profits  appeared  to  be  booming  and  most  of  the
world was at peace but that did not meannor could it ever mean
that stocks were worth buying at any price since the profits that com
panies can earn are finite the price that investors should be willing to
pay for stocks must also be finite

think of it this way michael jordan may well have been the great
est basketball player of all time and he pulled fans into chicago sta
dium like a giant electromagnet the chicago bulls got a bargain by
paying  jordan  up  to  34  million  a  year  to  bounce  a  big  leather  ball
around a wooden floor but that does not mean the bulls would have
been justified paying him 340 million or 34 billion or 34 billion
per season

t h e l i m i t s   o f   o p t i m i s m

focusing  on  the  markets  recent  returns  when  they  have  been  rosy
warns graham will lead to a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion
that equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks
in the future from 1995 through 1999 as the market rose by at least
20  each  yeara  surge  unprecedented  in  american  historystock
buyers became ever more optimistic



in  mid1998  investors  surveyed  by  the  gallup  organization  for
the painewebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn
an average of roughly 13 over the year to come by early 2000
their average expected return had jumped to more than 18

84



commentary on chapter 3

sophisticated professionals were just as bullish jacking up their
own  assumptions  of  future  returns  in  2001  for  instance  sbc
communications raised the projected return on its pension plan
from 85 to 95 by 2002 the average assumed rate of return
on the pension plans of companies in the standard  poors 500
stock index had swollen to a recordhigh 92

a quick followup shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm

 gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of
oneyear  returns  on  stocks  had  slumped  to  7even  though
investors  could  now  buy  at  prices  nearly  50  lower  than  in
20002
those  gungho  assumptions  about  the  returns  on  their  pension
plans will cost the companies in the s  p 500 a bare minimum of
32  billion  between  2002  and  2004  according  to  recent  wall
street estimates



even  though  investors  all  know  they are  supposed  to  buy  low  and
sell high in practice they often end up getting it backwards grahams
warning in this chapter is simple by the rule of opposites the more
enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run
the  more  certain  they  are  to  be  proved  wrong  in  the  short  run  on
march  24  2000  the  total  value  of  the  us  stock  market  peaked  at
1475  trillion  by  october  9  2002  just  30  months  later  the  total
us  stock  market  was  worth  734  trillion  or  502  lessa  loss  of
741  trillion  meanwhile  many  market  pundits  turned  sourly  bear
ish  predicting  flat  or  even  negative  market  returns  for  yearseven
decadesto come

at this point graham would ask one simple question considering
how calamitously wrong the experts were the last time they agreed
on  something  why  on  earth  should  the  intelligent  investor  believe
them now

2 those cheaper stock prices do not mean of course that investors expec
tation of a 7 stock return will be realized

commentary on chapter 3

85

w h a t  s   n e x t 

instead let us tune out the noise and think about future returns as gra
ham might the stock markets performance depends on three factors






real growth the rise of companies earnings and dividends
inflationary  growth  the  general  rise  of  prices  throughout  the
economy
speculative  growthor  decline  any  increase  or  decrease  in  the
investing publics appetite for stocks

in the long run the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share
has averaged 15 to 2 not counting inflation3 as of early 2003
inflation  was  running  around  24  annually  the  dividend  yield  on
stocks was 19 so

15 to 2

 24
 19
 58 to 63

in  the  long  run  that  means  you  can  reasonably  expect  stocks  to
average  roughly  a  6  return  or  4  after  inflation  if  the  investing
public gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit then that
speculative  fever  will  temporarily  drive  returns  higher  if  instead
investors  are  full  of  fear  as  they  were  in  the  1930s  and  1970s  the
returns  on  stocks  will  go  temporarily  lower  that is  where  we  are  in
2003

robert shiller a finance professor at yale university says graham
inspired his valuation approach shiller compares the current price of
the  standard    poors  500stock  index  against  average  corporate
profits over the past 10 years after inflation by scanning the histori
cal record shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20
the market usually delivers poor returns afterward when it drops well

so from valuation levels similar to those of early 2003 the stock
market has sometimes done very well in the ensuing 10 years some
times poorly and muddled along the rest of the time i think graham
ever the conservative would split the difference between the lowest
and highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks
will earn roughly 6 annually or 4 after inflation interestingly that
projection  matches  the  estimate  we  got  earlier  when  we  added
together  real  growth  inflationary  growth  and  speculative  growth
compared to the 1990s 6 is chicken feed but its a whisker better
than the gains that bonds are likely to produceand reason enough for
most investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio

but there is a second lesson in grahams approach the only thing
you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that
you will probably turn out to be wrong the only indisputable truth that
the past teaches us is that the future will always surprise usalways
and the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will
most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their
views about the future are right staying humble about your forecast
ing powers as graham did will keep you from risking too much on a
view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong

so by all means you should lower your expectationsbut take care
not  to  depress  your  spirit  for  the  intelligent  investor  hope  always
springs eternal because it should in the financial markets the worse
the future looks the better it usually turns out to be a cynic once told

chapter 4

general portfolio policy 

the defensive investor

the  basic  characteristics  of  an  investment  portfolio  are  usually
determined  by  the  position  and  characteristics  of  the  owner  or
owners at one extreme we have had savings banks lifeinsurance
companies and socalled legal trust funds a generation ago their
investments  were  limited  by  law  in  many  states  to  highgrade
bonds and in some cases highgrade preferred stocks at the other
extreme  we  have  the  welltodo  and  experienced  businessman
who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro
vided he considers it an attractive purchase

it  has  been  an  old  and  sound  principle  that  those  who  cannot
afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return
on their invested funds from this there has developed the general
notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is
more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run
our view is different the rate of return sought should be depen
dent rather on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will
ing and able to bring to bear on his task the minimum return goes
to our passive investor who wants both safety and freedom from
concern the maximum return would be realized by the alert and
enterprising  investor  who  exercises  maximum  intelligence  and
skill in 1965 we added in many cases there may be less real risk
associated  with  buying  a  bargain  issue  offering  the  chance  of  a
large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about
412 this statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus
pected  since  in  subsequent  years  even  the  best  longterm  bonds
lost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in
interest rates

88

general portfolio policy

89

the basic problem of bondstock allocation

we have already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of
the defensive investor he should divide his funds between high
grade bonds and highgrade common stocks

we have  suggested  as  a  fundamental  guiding  rule  that  the
investor should never have less than 25 or more than 75 of his
funds  in  common  stocks  with  a  consequent  inverse  range  of
between 75 and 25 in bonds there is an implication here that
the  standard  division  should  be  an  equal  one  or  5050  between
the  two  major  investment  mediums  according  to  tradition  the
sound  reason  for  increasing  the  percentage  in  common  stocks
would be the appearance of the bargain price levels created in a
protracted  bear  market  conversely  sound  procedure  would  call
for  reducing  the  commonstock  component  below  50  when  in 
the judgment of the investor the market level has become danger
ously high

these  copybook  maxims  have  always  been  easy  to  enunciate
and always difficult to followbecause they go against that very
human nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear mar
kets  it  is  almost  a  contradiction  in  terms  to  suggest  as  a  feasible
policy for the average stockowner that he lighten his holdings when
the market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after
a  corresponding  decline  it  is  because  the  average  man  operates
and apparently must operate in opposite fashion that we have had
the  great  advances  and  collapses  of  the  past  andthis  writer
believeswe are likely to have them in the future

if  the  division  between  investment  and  speculative  operations
were  as  clear  now  as  once  it  was  we  might  be  able  to  envisage
investors as a shrewd experienced group who sell out to the heed
less hapless speculators at high prices and buy back from them at
depressed levels this picture may have had some verisimilitude in
bygone  days  but  it  is  hard  to  identify  it  with  financial  develop
ments  since  1949  there  is  no  indication  that  such  professional
operations  as  those  of  the  mutual  funds  have  been  conducted  in
this fashion the percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the

 see grahams conclusion to chapter 2 p 5657

90

the intelligent investor

two major types of fundsbalanced and commonstockhas
changed very little from year to year their selling activities have
been  largely  related  to  endeavors  to  switch  from  less  to  more
promising holdings

if  as  we  have  long  believed  the  stock  market  has  lost  contact
with its old bounds and if new ones have not yet been established
then we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce
his commonstock holdings toward the 25 minimum and rebuild
them later to the 75 maximum we can urge that in general the
investor should not have more than onehalf in equities unless he
has strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is
sure that he could view a market decline of the 196970 type with
equanimity it is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can
be  justified  at  the  levels  existing  in  early  1972  thus  we  would
counsel  against  a  greater  than  50  apportionment  to  common
stocks  at  this  time  but  for  complementary  reasons  it  is  almost
equally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50
unless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current
market level and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in
any further rise to say 25 of his total funds

we are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may
appear to be an oversimplified 5050 formula under this plan the
guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi
sion between bond and stock holdings when changes in the mar
ket  level  have  raised  the  commonstock  component  to  say  55
the balance would be restored by a sale of oneeleventh of the stock
portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds conversely a
fall in the commonstock proportion to 45 would call for the use
of oneeleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities

yale university followed a somewhat similar plan for a number
of years after 1937 but it was geared around a 35 normal hold
ing in common stocks in the early 1950s however yale seems to
have given up its once famous formula and in 1969 held 61 of its
portfolio  in  equities  including  some  convertibles  at  that  time
the endowment funds of 71 such institutions totaling 76 billion
held  603  in  common  stocks  the  yale  example  illustrates  the
almost lethal effect of the great market advance upon the once pop
ular formula approach to investment nonetheless we are convinced
that our 5050 version of this approach makes good sense for the

defensive investor it is extremely simple it aims unquestionably in
the right direction it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least
making  some  moves  in  response  to  market  developments  most
important  of  all  it  will  restrain  him  from  being  drawn  more  and
more heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and
more dangerous heights

furthermore a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with
the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market while in a
severe  decline  he  may  derive  much  solace  from  reflecting  how
much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends

while our proposed 5050 division is undoubtedly the simplest
allpurpose program devisable it may not turn out to be the best
in terms of results achieved of course no approach mechanical
or otherwise can be advanced with any assurance that it will work
out  better  than  another  the  much  larger  income  return  now
offered  by  good  bonds  than  by  representative  stocks  is  a  potent
argument for favoring the bond component the investors choice
between 50 or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on
his own temperament and attitude if he can act as a coldblooded
weigher of the odds he would be likely to favor the low 25 stock
component at this time with the idea of waiting until the djia div
idend yield was say twothirds of the bond yield before he would
establish  his  median  5050  division  between  bonds  and  stocks
starting  from  900  for  the  djia and  dividends  of  36  on  the  unit
this would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 712 to
about  55  without  any  change  in  the  present  return  on  leading
stocks or a fall in the djia to as low as 660 if there is no reduction
in  bond  yields  and  no  increase  in  dividends  a combination  of
intermediate  changes  could  produce  the  same  buying  point a
program of that kind is not especially complicated the hard part is
to  adopt  it  and  to  stick  to  it  not  to  mention  the  possibility  that  it
may turn out to have been much too conservative

the bond component

the  choice  of  issues  in  the  bond  component  of  the  investors
portfolio will turn about two main questions should he buy tax
able or taxfree bonds and should he buy shorter or longerterm
maturities  the  tax  decision  should  be  mainly  a  matter  of  arith

92

the intelligent investor

metic  turning  on  the  difference  in  yields  as  compared  with  the
investors tax bracket in january 1972 the choice in 20year maturi
ties  was  between  obtaining  say  712  on  grade  aa  corporate
bonds and 53 on prime taxfree issues the term municipals is
generally  applied  to  all  species  of  taxexempt  bonds  including
state obligations there was thus for this maturity a loss in income
of some 30 in passing from the corporate to the municipal field
hence  if  the  investor  was  in  a  maximum  tax  bracket  higher  than
30 he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic
ipal bonds the opposite if his maximum tax was less than 30 a
single  person  starts  paying  a  30  rate  when  his  income  after
deductions  passes  10000  for  a  married  couple  the  rate  applies
when combined taxable income passes 20000 it is evident that a
large  proportion  of  individual  investors  would  obtain  a  higher
return after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate
bonds

the choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a
different  question  viz  does  the  investor  want  to  assure  himself
against a decline in the price of his bonds but at the cost of 1 a
lower annual yield and 2 loss of the possibility of an appreciable
gain in principal value we think it best to discuss this question in
chapter 8 the investor and market fluctuations

for  a  period  of  many  years  in  the  past  the  only  sensible  bond
purchases for individuals were the us savings issues their safety
wasand isunquestioned they gave a higher return than other
bond  investments  of  first  quality  they  had  a  moneyback  option
and other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness in
our earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled us savings
bonds a boon to investors

as  we  shall  point  out  us  savings  bonds  still  possess  certain
unique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ
ual  investor  for  the  man  of  modest  capitalwith  say  not  more
than 10000 to put into bondswe think they are still the easiest
and  the  best  choice  but  those  with  larger  funds  may  find  other
mediums more desirable

let us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con
sideration  and  discuss  them  briefly  with  respect  to  general
description safety yield market price risk incometax status and
other features

general portfolio policy

93

1 us savings bonds series e and series h we shall first sum
marize  their  important  provisions  and  then  discuss  briefly  the
numerous advantages of these unique attractive and exceedingly
convenient  investments  the  series  h  bonds  pay  interest  semi
annually as do other bonds the rate is 429 for the first year and
then a flat 510 for the next nine years to maturity interest on the
series  e  bonds  is  not  paid  out  but  accrues  to  the  holder  through
increase  in  redemption  value  the  bonds  are  sold  at  75  of  their
face value and mature at 100 in 5 years 10 months after purchase
if held to maturity the yield works out at 5 compounded semi
annually if redeemed earlier the yield moves up from a minimum
of 401 in the first year to an average of 520 in the next 456 years
interest  on  the  bonds  is  subject  to  federal  income  tax  but  is
exempt from state income tax however federal income tax on the
series e bonds may be paid at the holders option either annually
as  the  interest  accrues  through  higher  redemption  value  or  not
until the bond is actually disposed of

owners of series e bonds may cash them in at any time shortly
after purchase at their current redemption value holders of series
h  bonds  have  similar  rights  to  cash  them  in  at  par  value  cost
series  e  bonds  are  exchangeable  for  series  h  bonds  with  certain
tax  advantages  bonds  lost  destroyed  or  stolen  may  be  replaced
without cost there are limitations on annual purchases but liberal
provisions  for  coownership  by  family  members  make  it  possible
for  most  investors  to  buy  as  many  as  they  can  afford  comment
there is no other investment that combines 1 absolute assurance
of  principal  and  interest  payments  2  the  right  to  demand  full
money back at any time and 3 guarantee of at least a 5 inter
est rate for at least ten years holders of the earlier issues of series
e bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity and
thus  to  continue  to  accumulate  annual  values  at  successively
higher rates the deferral of incometax payments over these long
periods  has  been  of  great  dollar  advantage  we  calculate  it  has
increased the effective netaftertax rate received by as much as a
third in typical cases conversely the right to cash in the bonds at
cost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low
interest  rates  complete  protection  against  the  shrinkage  in  princi
pal value that befell many bond investors otherwise stated it gave
them  the  possibility  of  benefiting from  the  rise  in  interest  rates  by

switching their lowinterest holdings into veryhighcoupon issues
on an evenmoney basis

in  our  view  the  special  advantages  enjoyed  by  owners  of  sav
ings bonds now will more than compensate for their lower current
return as compared with other direct government obligations

2 other united states bonds a profusion of these issues exists
covering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates all of
them are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and
principal  they  are  subject  to  federal  income  taxes  but  free  from
state income tax in late 1971 the longterm issuesover ten years
showed an average yield of 609 intermediate issues three to five
years returned 635 and short issues returned 603

in 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large dis
counts  some  of  these  are  accepted  at  par  in  settlement  of  estate
taxes example the us treasury 312s due 1990 are in this category
they sold at 60 in 1970 but closed 1970 above 77

it is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect obli
gations  of  the  us  government  yield  appreciably  more  than  its
direct  obligations  of  the  same  maturity  as  we  write  an  offering
appears of 705 of certificates fully guaranteed by the secretary
of  transportation  of  the  department  of  transportation  of  the
united  states  the  yield  was  fully  1  more  than  that  on  direct
obligations of the us maturing the same year 1986 the certifi
cates were actually issued in the name of the trustees of the penn
central  transportation  co  but  they  were  sold  on  the  basis  of  a
statement by the us attorney general that the guarantee brings
into being a general obligation of the united states backed by its
full faith and credit quite a number of indirect obligations of this
sort have been assumed by the us government in the past and all
of them have been scrupulously honored

the reader may wonder why all this hocuspocus involving an
apparently  personal  guarantee  by  our  secretary  of  transporta
tion and a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end the chief reason
for  the  indirection  has  been  the  debt  limit  imposed  on  govern
ment  borrowing  by  the  congress  apparently  guarantees  by  the
government  are  not  regarded  as  debtsa  semantic  windfall  for
shrewder investors perhaps the chief impact of this situation has
been  the  creation  of  taxfree  housing  authority  bonds  enjoying

the  equivalent  of  a  us  guarantee  and  virtually  the  only  tax
exempt  issues  that  are  equivalent  to  government  bonds another
type  of  governmentbacked  issues  is  the  recently  created  new
community debentures offered to yield 760 in september 1971

3 state  and  municipal  bonds these  enjoy  exemption  from
federal income tax they are also ordinarily free of income tax in
the state of issue but not elsewhere they are either direct obliga
tions of a state or subdivision or revenue bonds dependent for
interest  payments  on  receipts  from  a  toll  road  bridge  building
lease etc not all taxfree bonds are strongly enough protected to
justify their purchase by a defensive investor he may be guided in
his selection by the rating given to each issue by moodys or stan
dard  poors one of three highest ratings by both servicesaaa
aaa aa aa or ashould constitute a sufficient indication of
adequate safety the yield on these bonds will vary both with the
quality  and  the  maturity  with  the  shorter  maturities  giving  the
lower  return  in  late  1971  the  issues  represented  in  standard  
poors  municipal  bond  index  averaged  aa in  quality  rating  20
years  in  maturity  and  578  in  yield  a typical  offering  of
vineland nj bonds rated aa for a and gave a yield of only 3
on the oneyear maturity rising to 58 to the 1995 and 1996 matu
rities1

4 corporation bonds these bonds are subject to both federal
and state tax in early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 719
for  a  25year  maturity  as  reflected  in  the  published  yield  of
moodys aaa corporate bond index the socalled lowermedium
grade  issuesrated  baareturned  823  for  long  maturities  in
each  class  shorterterm  issues  would  yield  somewhat  less  than
longerterm obligations

comment the  above  summaries  indicate  that  the  average
investor  has  several  choices  among  highgrade  bonds  those  in
high incometax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield
from  good  taxfree  issues  than  from  taxable  ones  for  others  the
early 1972 range of taxable yield would seem to be from 500 on
us  savings  bonds  with  their  special  options  to  about  712  on
highgrade corporate issues

higheryielding bond investments

by  sacrificing  quality  an  investor  can  obtain  a  higher  income
return from his bonds long experience has demonstrated that the
ordinary  investor  is  wiser  to  keep  away  from  such  highyield
bonds while taken as a whole they may work out somewhat bet
ter  in  terms  of  overall  return  than  the  firstquality  issues  they
expose the owner to too many individual risks of untoward devel
opments ranging from disquieting price declines to actual default
it  is  true  that  bargain  opportunities  occur  fairly  often  in  lower
grade  bonds  but  these  require  special  study  and  skill  to  exploit
successfully

perhaps  we  should  add  here  that  the  limits  imposed  by  con
gress on direct bond issues of the united states have produced at
least two sorts of bargain opportunities for investors in the pur
chase  of  governmentbacked  obligations  one  is  provided  by  the
taxexempt  new  housing  issues  and  the  other  by  the  recently
created  taxable  new  community  debentures  an  offering  of
new housing issues in july 1971 yielded as high as 58 free from
both federal and state taxes while an issue of taxable new com
munity  debentures  sold  in  september  1971  yielded  760  both
obligations  have  the  full  faith  and  credit  of  the  united  states
government  behind  them  and  hence  are  safe  without  question
andon a net basisthey yield considerably more than ordinary
united states bonds

 grahams  objection  to  highyield  bonds  is  mitigated  today  by  the  wide
spread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the research
of owning junk bonds see the commentary on chapter 6 for more detail
 the  new  housing  bonds  and  new  community  debentures  are  no
more new housing authority bonds were backed by the us department
of housing and urban development hud and were exempt from income
tax but they have not been issued since 1974 new community debentures
also  backed  by  hud  were  authorized  by  a  federal  law  passed  in  1968
about 350 million of these debentures were issued through 1975 but the
program was terminated in 1983

savings deposits in lieu of bonds

an  investor  may  now  obtain  as  high  an  interest  rate  from  a 
savings deposit in a commercial or savings bank or from a bank
certificate  of  deposit  as  he  can  from  a  firstgrade  bond  of  short
maturity the interest rate on bank savings accounts may be low
ered in the future but under present conditions they are a suitable
substitute for shortterm bond investment by the individual

convertible issues

these are discussed in chapter 16 the price variability of bonds
in general is treated in chapter 8 the investor and market fluctu
ations

call provisions

in  previous  editions  we  had  a  fairly  long  discussion  of  this
aspect  of  bond  financing  because  it  involved  a  serious  but  little
noticed  injustice  to  the  investor  in  the  typical  case  bonds  were
callable  fairly  soon  after  issuance  and  at  modest  premiumssay
5above the issue price this meant that during a period of wide
fluctuations  in  the  underlying  interest  rates  the  investor  had  to
bear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all
but a meager participation in favorable ones

example our standard example has been the issue of american
gas  electric 100year 5 debentures sold to the public at 101 in
1928  four  years  later  under  nearpanic  conditions  the  price  of
these good bonds fell to 6212 yielding 8 by 1946 in a great rever
sal bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3 and the 5
issue should have been quoted at close to 160 but at that point the
company  took  advantage  of  the  call  provision  and  redeemed  the
issue at a mere 106

the call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised
instance  of  heads  i  win  tails  you  lose  at  long  last  the  bond
buying  institutions  refused  to  accept  this  unfair  arrangement  in
recent  years  most  longterm  highcoupon  issues  have  been  pro
tected against redemption for ten years or more after issuance this
still limits their possible price rise but not inequitably

98

the intelligent investor

in practical terms we advise the investor in longterm issues to
sacrifice  a  small  amount  of  yield  to  obtain  the  assurance  of  non
callabilitysay for 20 or 25 years similarly there is an advantage
in  buying  a  lowcoupon  bond  at  a  discount  rather  than  a  high
coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years for
the discounteg of a 312 bond at 6312 yielding 785carries
full protection against adverse call action

straightie nonconvertiblepreferred stocks

certain general observations should be made here on the subject
of preferred stocks really good preferred stocks can and do exist
but  they  are  good  in  spite  of  their  investment  form  which  is  an
inherently bad one the typical preferred shareholder is dependent
for his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi
dends on its common stock once the common dividends are omit
ted  or  even  in  danger  his  own  position  becomes  precarious  for
the directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless
they also pay on the common on the other hand the typical pre
ferred stock carries no share in the companys profits beyond the
fixed dividend rate thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal
claim of the bondholder or creditor and the profit possibilities of
a common shareholder or partner

these weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend
to  come  to  the  fore  recurrently  in  periods  of  depression  only  a
small percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched
as to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis
situdes experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is
when their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity at
such times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but
too unconventional for the defensive investor

in other words they should be bought on a bargain basis or not
at  all  we  shall  refer  later  to  convertible  and  similarly  privileged
issues which carry some special possibilities of profits these are
not ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio

another  peculiarity  in  the  general  position  of  preferred  stocks

 a bonds coupon is its interest rate a lowcoupon bond pays a rate of
interest income below the market average

general portfolio policy

99

deserves mention they have a much better tax status for corpora
tion buyers than for individual investors corporations pay income
tax on only 15 of the income they receive in dividends but on the
full amount of their ordinary interest income since the 1972 corpo
rate  rate  is  48  this  means  that  100  received  as  preferredstock
dividends is taxed only 720 whereas 100 received as bond inter
est  is  taxed  48  on  the  other  hand  individual  investors  pay
exactly  the  same  tax  on  preferredstock  investments  as  on  bond
interest except for a recent minor exemption thus in strict logic
all investmentgrade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo
rations just as all taxexempt bonds should be bought by investors
who pay income tax

security forms

the  bond  form  and  the  preferredstock  form  as  hitherto  dis
cussed are wellunderstood and relatively simple matters a bond
holder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal
on  a  definite  date  the  owner  of  a  preferred  stock  is  entitled  to  a
fixed dividend and no more which must be paid before any com
mon dividend his principal value does not come due on any spec
ified date the dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative he
may or may not have a vote

the above describes the standard provisions and no doubt the
majority  of  bond  and  preferred  issues  but  there  are  innumerable
departures from these forms the bestknown types are convertible
and  similar  issues  and  income  bonds  in  the  latter  type  interest
does  not  have  to  be  paid  unless  it  is  earned  by  the  company
unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn
ings but the period is often limited to three years

income  bonds  should  be  used  by  corporations  much  more

 while grahams logic remains valid the numbers have changed corpora
tions can currently deduct 70 of the income they receive from dividends
and the standard corporate tax rate is 35 thus a corporation would pay
roughly  2450  in  tax  on  100  in  dividends  from  preferred  stock  versus
35  in  tax  on  100  in  interest  income  individuals  pay  the  same  rate  of
income tax on dividend income that they do on interest income so preferred
stock offers them no tax advantage

the intelligent investor

extensively than they are their avoidance apparently arises from a
mere  accident  of  economic  historynamely  that  they  were  first
employed in quantity in connection with railroad reorganizations
and hence they have been associated from the start with financial
weakness and poor investment status but the form itself has sev
eral  practical  advantages  especially  in  comparison  with  and  in
substitution for the numerous convertible preferredstock issues
of  recent  years  chief  of  these  is  the  deductibility  of  the  interest
paid from the companys taxable income which in effect cuts the
cost of that form of capital in half from the investors standpoint it
is probably best for him in most cases that he should have 1 an
unconditional  right  to  receive  interest  payments  when  they  are
earned by the company and 2 a right to other forms of protection
than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid the
terms  of  income  bonds  can  be  tailored  to  the  advantage  of  both 
the  borrower  and  the  lender  in  the  manner  best  suited  to  both
conversion privileges can of course be included the acceptance
by  everybody  of  the  inherently  weak  preferredstock  form  and 
the  rejection  of  the  stronger  incomebond  form  is  a  fascinating
illustration of the way in which traditional institutions and habits
often tend to persist on wall street despite new conditions calling
for  a  fresh  point  of  view  with  every  new  wave  of  optimism  or 
pessimism we are ready to abandon history and timetested prin
ciples but we cling tenaciously and unquestioningly to our preju
dices

basketball coach pat riley

how aggressive should your portfolio be

that says graham depends less on what kinds of investments you
own than on what kind of investor you are there are two ways to be
an intelligent investor





by  continually  researching  selecting  and  monitoring  a  dynamic
mix of stocks bonds or mutual funds
or  by  creating  a  permanent  portfolio  that  runs  on  autopilot  and
requires no further effort but generates very little excitement

graham calls the first approach active or enterprising it takes
lots of time and loads of energy the passive or defensive strategy
takes  little  time  or  effort  but  requires  an  almost  ascetic  detachment
from  the  alluring  hullabaloo  of  the  market  as  the  investment  thinker
charles  ellis  has  explained  the  enterprising  approach  is  physically
and  intellectually  taxing  while  the  defensive  approach  is  emotionally
demanding1

if you have time to spare are highly competitive think like a sports
fan  and  relish  a  complicated  intellectual  challenge  then  the  active

approach is up your alley if you always feel rushed crave simplicity
and do not relish thinking about money then the passive approach is for
you some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth
odscreating  a  portfolio  that  is  mainly  active  and  partly  passive  or
vice versa

both approaches are equally intelligent and you can be successful
with eitherbut only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right
one stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime and keep
your costs and emotions under control grahams distinction between
active and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for itin the economy or in our
investmentsbut also within ourselves

c a n   y o you   b e   b r a v e    o are   w i l l   y o you   c a v e 

how then should a defensive investor get started the first and most
basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in
bonds  and  cash  note  that  graham  deliberately  places  this  discus
sion after his chapter on inflation forearming you with the knowledge
that inflation is one of your worst enemies

the most striking thing about grahams discussion of how to allo
cate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions
the word age that sets his advice firmly against the winds of con
ventional wisdomwhich holds that how much investing risk you ought
to take depends mainly on how old you are2 a traditional rule of thumb
was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your
assets in stocks with the rest in bonds or cash a 28yearold would
put 72 of her money in stocks an 81yearold would put only 19
there like everything else these assumptions got overheated in the
late 1990s by 1999 a popular book argued that if you were younger
than 30 you should put 95 of your money in stockseven if you had
only a moderate tolerance for risk 3

up more than 30000 online references

unless  you have  allowed  the  proponents  of  this  advice  to  subtract
100 from your iq you should be able to tell that something is wrong
here why should your age determine how much risk you can take
an  89yearold  with  3  million  an  ample  pension  and  a  gaggle  of
grandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds
she  already  has  plenty  of  income  and  her  grandchildren  who  will
eventually  inherit  her  stocks  have  decades  of  investing  ahead  of
them on the other hand a 25yearold who is saving for his wedding
and  a  house  down  payment  would  be  out  of  his  mind  to  put  all  his
money in stocks if the stock market takes an acapulco high dive he
will have no bond income to cover his downsideor his backside

what is  more  no  matter  how  young  you  are  you  might  suddenly
need to yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now but 40
minutes from now without a whiff of warning you could lose your job
get divorced become disabled or suffer who knows what other kind
of surprise the unexpected can strike anyone at any age everyone
must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash

finally  many  people  stop  investing  precisely  because the  stock
market  goes  down  psychologists  have  shown  that  most  of  us  do  a
very poor job of predicting today how we will feel about an emotionally
charged event in the future4 when stocks are going up 15 or 20
a year as they did in the 1980s and 1990s its easy to imagine that
you  and  your  stocks  are  married  for  life  but  when  you  watch  every
dollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime its hard to resist
bailing out into the safety of bonds and cash instead of buying and
holding their stocks many people end up buying high selling low and
holding  nothing  but  their  own  head  in  their  hands  because  so  few
investors have the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market graham
insists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25 in bonds that
cushion he argues will give you the courage to keep the rest of your
money in stocks even when stocks stink

to get a better feel for how much risk you can take think about the
fundamental  circumstances  of  your  life  when  they  will  kick  in  when
they might change and how they are likely to affect your need for cash

grahams minimum of 25 in bonds or cash if not then steer mostly
clear of stocks edging toward grahams maximum of 75 in bonds
or  cash  to  find  out  whether  you  can  go  up  to  100  see  the 
sidebar on p 105

once you set these target percentages change them only as your
life circumstances change do not buy more stocks because the stock
market has gone up do not sell them because it has gone down the

graham advises you never to have more than 75 of your total
assets  in  stocks  but  is  putting  all  your  money  into  the  stock
market inadvisable for everyone for a tiny minority of investors

unless  you  can  honestly  pass  all  these  tests  you  have  no

in grahams day bond investors faced two basic choices taxable or
taxfree  shortterm  or  longterm  today  there  is  a  third  bonds  or
bond funds

taxable or taxfree unless you are in the lowest tax bracket6 you
should  buy  only  taxfree  municipal  bonds  outside  your  retirement
accounts otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the
hands of the irs the only place to own taxable bonds is inside your
401k  or  another  sheltered  account  where  you  will  owe  no  current
tax on their incomeand where municipal bonds have no place since
their tax advantage goes to waste7

shortterm  or  longterm bonds  and  interest  rates  teeter  on
opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw  if  interest  rates  rise  bond  prices  fall
although a shortterm bond falls far less than a longterm bond on the
other  hand  if  interest  rates  fall  bond  prices  riseand  a  longterm
bond will outperform shorter ones8 you can split the difference simply

6 for the 2003 tax year the bottom federal tax bracket is for single people
earning less than 28400 or married people filing jointly earning less than
47450
7 two  good  online  calculators  that  will  help  you  compare  the  aftertax  in
come of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at wwwinvestinginbonds
comcgibincalculatorpl  and  wwwlebenthalcomindexinfocenterhtml  to
decide if a muni is right for you find the taxable equivalent yield gener
ated by these calculators then compare that number to the yield currently
available on treasury bonds httpmoneycnncommarketsbondcenter or
wwwbloombergcommarketsc13html  if  the  yield  on  treasury  bonds  is
higher than the taxable equivalent yield munis are not for you in any case
be  warned  that  municipal  bonds  and  funds  produce  lower  income  and
more price fluctuation than most taxable bonds also the alternative mini
mum  tax  which  now  hits  many  middleincome  americans  can  negate  the
advantages of municipal bonds

by buying intermediateterm bonds maturing in five to 10 yearswhich
do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises but do not slam into
the ground either for most investors intermediate bonds are the sim
plest choice since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing
what interest rates will do

bonds or bond funds since bonds are generally sold in 10000
lots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the
risk  that  any  one  of  them  might  go  bust  buying  individual  bonds
makes  no  sense  unless  you  have  at  least  100000  to  invest  the
only exception is bonds issued by the us treasury since they are pro
tected against default by the full force of the american government

bond  funds  offer  cheap  and  easy  diversification  along  with  the
convenience of monthly income which you can reinvest right back into
the  fund  at  current  rates  without  paying  a  commission  for  most
investors  bond  funds  beat  individual  bonds  hands  down  the  main
exceptions are treasury securities and some municipal bonds major
firms like vanguard fidelity schwab and t rowe price offer a broad
menu of bond funds at low cost9

the defensive investor and common stocks

investment merits of common stocks

in  our  first  edition  1949  we  found  it  necessary  at  this  point 
to  insert  a  long  exposition  of  the  case  for  including  a  substantial
commonstock component in all investment portfolios common
stocks  were  generally  viewed  as  highly  speculative  and  therefore
unsafe they had declined fairly substantially from the high levels
of 1946 but instead of attracting investors to them because of their
reasonable prices this fall had had the opposite effect of undermin
ing  confidence  in  equity  securities  we  have  commented  on  the
converse  situation  that  has  developed  in  the  ensuing  20  years
whereby  the  big  advance  in  stock  prices  made  them  appear  safe
and profitable investments at record high levels which might actu
ally carry with them a considerable degree of risk

the  argument  we  made  for  common  stocks  in  1949  turned  on

 at the beginning of 1949 the average annual return produced by stocks
over the previous 20 years was 31 versus 39 for longterm treasury
bondsmeaning  that  10000  invested  in  stocks  would  have  grown  to
18415  over  that  period  while  the  same  amount  in  bonds  would  have
turned  into  21494  naturally  enough  1949  turned  out  to  be  a  fabulous
time to buy stocks over the next decade the standard  poors 500stock
index  gained  an  average  of  201  per  year  one  of  the  best  longterm
returns in the history of the us stock market
 grahams  earlier  comments  on  this  subject  appear  on  pp  1920  just
imagine  what  he  would  have  thought  about  the  stock  market  of  the  late
1990s  in  which  each  new  recordsetting  high  was  considered  further
proof that stocks were the riskless way to wealth

112

the defensive investor and common stocks

113

two main points the first was that they had offered a considerable
degree  of  protection  against  the  erosion  of  the  investors  dollar
caused by inflation whereas bonds offered no protection at all the
second  advantage  of  common  stocks  lay  in  their  higher  average
return to investors over the years this was produced both by an
average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and
by  an  underlying  tendency  for  market  value  to  increase  over  the
years in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits

while  these  two  advantages  have  been  of  major  importance
and  have  given  common  stocks  a  far  better  record  than  bonds 
over the longterm pastwe have consistently warned that these
benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price
for his shares this was clearly the case in 1929 and it took 25 years
for  the  market  level  to  climb  back  to  the  ledge  from  which  it 
had  abysmally  fallen  in  19291932  since  1957  common  stocks
have  once  again  through  their  high  prices  lost  their  traditional
advantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates it remains to

 the dow jones industrial average closed at a thenrecord high of 38117
on september 3 1929 it did not close above that level until november 23
1954more than a quarter of a century laterwhen it hit 38274 when you
say you intend to own stocks for the long run do you realize just how long
the long run can beor that many investors who bought in 1929 were no
longer even alive by 1954 however for patient investors who reinvested
their income stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period
simply because dividend yields averaged more than 56 per year accord
ing to professors elroy dimson paul marsh and mike staunton of london
business school if you had invested 1 in us stocks in 1900 and spent
all your dividends your stock portfolio would have grown to 198 by 2000
but if you had reinvested all your dividends your stock portfolio would have
been  worth  16797  far  from  being  an  afterthought  dividends  are  the
greatest force in stock investing
 why do the high prices of stocks affect their dividend yields a stocks
yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common
stock if a company pays a 2 annual dividend when its stock price is 100
per share its yield is 2 but if the stock price doubles while the dividend
stays constant the dividend yield will drop to 1 in 1959 when the trend
graham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone most wall street

the intelligent investor

be seen whether the inflation factor and the economicgrowth fac
tor will make up in the future for this significantly adverse devel
opment

it should be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm
for common stocks in general at the 900 djia level of late 1971 for
reasons  already  given  we  feel  that  the  defensive  investor  cannot
afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks
in  his  portfolio  even  if  he  must  regard  them  as  the  lesser  of  two
evilsthe greater being the risks attached to an allbond holding

rules for the commonstock component

the selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive
investor should be a relatively simple matter here we would sug
gest four rules to be followed

1  there  should  be  adequate  though  not  excessive  diversifica
tion  this  might  mean  a  minimum  of  ten  different  issues  and  a
maximum of about thirty

2 each company selected should be large prominent and con
servatively  financed  indefinite  as  these  adjectives  must  be  their
general sense is clear observations on this point are added at the
end of the chapter

3 each company should have a long record of continuous divi
dend payments all the issues in the dow jones industrial aver

pundits  declared  that  it  could  not  possibly  last  never  before  had  stocks
yielded less than bonds after all since stocks are riskier than bonds why
would anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to com
pensate for their greater risk the experts argued that bonds would outyield
stocks for a few months at most and then things would revert to normal
more than four decades later the relationship has never been normal again
the  yield  on  stocks  has  so  far  continuously  stayed  below  the  yield  on
bonds

age met this dividend requirement in 1971 to be specific on this
point  we  would  suggest  the  requirement  of  continuous  dividend
payments beginning at least in 1950

4  the  investor  should  impose  some  limit  on  the  price  he  will
pay  for  an  issue  in  relation  to  its  average  earnings  over  say  the
past seven years we suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such
average  earnings  and  not  more  than  20  times  those  of  the  last
twelvemonth  period  but  such  a  restriction  would  eliminate
nearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port
folio  in  particular  it  would  ban  virtually  the  entire  category  of
growth stocks which have for some years past been the favorites
of  both  speculators  and  institutional  investors  we  must  give  our
reasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion

growth stocks and the defensive investor

the term growth stock is applied to one which has increased
its pershare earnings in the past at well above the rate for common
stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future
some  authorities  would  say  that  a  true  growth  stock  should  be
expected at least to double its pershare earnings in ten yearsie
to  increase  them  at  a  compounded  annual  rate  of  over  71
obviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own pro
vided  the  price  paid  is  not  excessive  the  problem  lies  there  of

 todays defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of
continuous  dividend  payments  which  would  eliminate  from  consideration
only  one  member  of  the  dow  jones  industrial  averagemicrosoftand
would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the s  p 500
index even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would
not  be  overly  restrictive  according  to  morgan  stanley  255  companies  in
the s  p 500 met that standard as of yearend 2002
 the rule of 72 is a handy mental tool to estimate the length of time an
amount  of  money  takes  to  double  simply  divide  its  assumed  growth  rate
into 72 at 6 for instance money will double in 12 years 72 divided by 
6  12 at the 71 rate cited by graham a growth stock will double its
earnings in just over 10 years 7271  101 years

116

the intelligent investor

course since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation
to current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average
profits  over  a  past  period  this  has  introduced  a  speculative  ele
ment  of  considerable  weight  in  the  growthstock  picture  and  has
made successful operations in this field a far from simple matter

the leading growth issue has long been international business
machines  and  it  has  brought  phenomenal  rewards  to  those  who
bought  it  years  ago  and  held  on  to  it  tenaciously  but  we  have
already  pointed  out   that  this  best  of  common  stocks  actually
lost 50 of its market price in a sixmonths decline during 196162
and  nearly  the  same  percentage  in  196970  other  growth  stocks
have been even more vulnerable to adverse developments in some
cases  not  only  has  the  price  fallen  back  but  the  earnings  as  well
thus  causing  a  double  discomfiture  to  those  who  owned  them a
good second example for our purpose is texas instruments which
in six years rose from 5 to 256 without paying a dividend while its
earnings increased from 40 cents to 391 per share note that the
price advanced five times as fast as the profits this is characteristic
of popular common stocks but two years later the earnings had
dropped off by nearly 50 and the price by fourfifths to 49

the reader will understand from these instances why we regard
growth stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for
the  defensive  investor  of  course  wonders  can  be  accomplished
with the right individual selections bought at the right levels and
later sold after a huge rise and before the probable decline but the
average investor can no more expect to accomplish this than to find
money  growing  on  trees  in  contrast  we  think  that  the  group  of

 graham makes this point on p 73
 to show that grahams observations are perennially true we can substi
tute microsoft for ibm and cisco for texas instruments thirty years apart
the  results  are  uncannily  similar  microsofts  stock  dropped  557  from
2000 through 2002 while ciscos stockwhich had risen roughly 50fold
over the previous six yearslost 76 of its value from 2000 through 2002
as with texas instruments the drop in ciscos stock price was sharper than
the fall in its earnings which dropped just 392 comparing the threeyear
average  for  19971999  against  20002002  as  always  the  hotter  they
are the harder they fall

large  companies  that  are  relatively  unpopular  and  therefore
obtainable  at  reasonable  earnings  multipliers  offers  a  sound  if
unspectacular area of choice by the general public we shall illus
trate this idea in our chapter on portfolio selection

portfolio changes

it  is  now  standard  practice  to  submit  all  security  lists  for  peri
odic  inspection  in  order  to  see  whether  their  quality  can  be
improved this of course is a major part of the service provided
for clients by investment counselors nearly all brokerage houses
are ready to make corresponding suggestions without special fee
in  return  for  the  commission  business  involved  some  brokerage
houses maintain investment services on a fee basis

presumably our defensive investor should obtainat least once
a yearthe same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio
as  he  sought  when  his  funds  were  first  committed  since  he  will
have little expertness of his own on which to rely it is essential that
he  entrust  himself  only  to  firms  of  the  highest  reputation  other
wise he may easily fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands it
is important in any case that at every such consultation he make
clear  to  his  adviser  that  he  wishes  to  adhere  closely  to  the  four
rules of commonstock selection given earlier in this chapter inci
dentally  if  his  list  has  been  competently  selected  in  the  first
instance  there  should  be  no  need  for  frequent  or  numerous
changes

 earnings multiplier is a synonym for pe or priceearnings ratios which
measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared to the

dollarcost averaging

the new york stock exchange has put considerable effort into
popularizing  its  monthly  purchase  plan  under  which  an
investor  devotes  the  same  dollar  amount  each  month  to  buying
one or more common stocks this is an application of a special type
of  formula  investment  known  as  dollarcost  averaging  during
the predominantly risingmarket experience since 1949 the results
from such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory espe
cially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his
buying at the wrong times

in  lucile  tomlinsons  comprehensive  study  of  formula  invest
ment  plans1 the  author  presented  a  calculation  of  the  results  of 
dollarcost  averaging  in  the  group  of  stocks  making  up  the  dow
jones industrial index tests were made covering 23 tenyear pur
chase periods the first ending in 1929 the last in 1952 every test
showed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within
five years thereafter the average indicated profit at the end of the
23  buying  periods  was  215  exclusive  of  dividends  received
needless to say in some instances there was a substantial tempo
rary depreciation at market value miss tomlinson ends her discus
sion  of  this  ultrasimple  investment  formula  with  the  striking
sentence no one has yet discovered any other formula for invest
ing  which  can  be  used  with  so  much  confidence  of  ultimate  suc
cess  regardless  of  what  may  happen  to  security  prices  as  dollar
cost averaging

it  may  be  objected  that  dollarcost  averaging  while  sound  in
principle is rather unrealistic in practice because few people are so
situated that they can have available for commonstock investment
the same amount of money each year for say 20 years it seems to
me that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent
years common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces
sary  component  of  a  sound  savingsinvestment  program  thus
systematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present
no  more  psychological  and  financial  difficulties  than  similar  con
tinuous  payments  for  united  states  savings  bonds  and  for  life
insuranceto which they should be complementary the monthly
amount may be small but the results after 20 or more years can be
impressive and important to the saver

the investors personal situation

at the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the posi
tion of the individual portfolio owner let us return to this matter
in the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy to what
extent  should  the  type  of  securities  selected  by  the  investor  vary
with his circumstances as concrete examples representing widely
different conditions we shall take 1 a widow left 200000 with
which to support herself and her children 2 a successful doctor in
midcareer  with  savings  of  100000  and  yearly  accretions  of
10000  and  3  a  young  man  earning  200  per  week  and  saving
1000 a year

for the widow the problem of living on her income is a very dif
ficult  one  on  the  other  hand  the  need  for  conservatism  in  her
investments  is  paramount  a division  of  her  fund  about  equally
between  united  states  bonds  and  firstgrade  common  stocks  is  a
compromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen
eral prescription for the defensive investor the stock component
may be placed as high as 75 if the investor is psychologically pre
pared for this decision and if she can be almost certain she is not
buying  at  too  high  a  level assuredly  this  is  not the  case  in  early
1972

we do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify
as an enterprising investor in which case her objectives and meth
ods will be quite different the one thing the widow must not do is
to take speculative chances in order to make some extra income
by this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec
essary  equipment  to  warrant  full  confidence  in  overall  success  it
would be far better for her to draw 2000 per year out of her prin
cipal  in  order  to  make  both  ends  meet  than  to  risk  half  of  it  in
poorly grounded and therefore speculative ventures

the prosperous doctor has none of the widows pressures and
compulsions  yet  we  believe  that  his  choices  are  pretty  much  the
same  is  he  willing  to  take  a  serious  interest  in  the  business  of
investment if he lacks the impulse or the flair he will do best to

 to update grahams figures take each dollar amount in this section and

the intelligent investor

accept  the  easy  role  of  the  defensive  investor  the  division  of  his
portfolio  should  then  be  no  different  from  that  of  the  typical
widow and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix
ing the size of the stock component the annual savings should be
invested in about the same proportions as the total fund

the average doctor may be more likely than the average widow
to elect to become an enterprising investor and he is perhaps more
likely to succeed in the undertaking he has one important handi
cap howeverthe fact that he has less time available to give to his
investment  education  and  to  the  administration  of  his  funds  in
fact medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu
rity dealings the reason for this is that they usually have an ample
confidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a
good return on their money without the realization that to do so
successfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and
something of a professional approach to security values

finally the young man who saves 1000 a yearand expects to
do better graduallyfinds himself with the same choices though
for still different reasons some of his savings should go automati
cally  into  series  e  bonds  the  balance  is  so  modest  that  it  seems
hardly  worthwhile  for  him  to  undergo  a  tough  educational  and
temperamental  discipline  in  order  to  qualify  as  an  aggressive
investor  thus  a  simple  resort  to  our  standard  program  for  the
defensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi
cal policy

let us not ignore human nature at this point finance has a fasci
nation  for  many  bright  young  people  with  limited  means  they
would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement
of  their  savings  even  though  investment  income  is  much  less
important  to  them  than  their  salaries  this  attitude  is  all  to  the
good there is a great advantage for the young capitalist to begin
his financial education and experience early if he is going to oper
ate as an aggressive investor he is certain to make some mistakes
and  to  take  some  losses  youth  can  stand  these  disappointments
and profit by them we urge the beginner in security buying not to
waste  his  efforts  and  his  money  in  trying  to  beat  the  market  let
him  study  security  values  and  initially  test  out  his  judgment  on
price versus value with the smallest possible sums

thus  we  return  to  the  statement  made  at  the  outset  that  the

the defensive investor and common stocks

121

kind  of  securities  to  be  purchased  and  the  rate  of  return  to  be
sought depend not on the investors financial resources but on his
financial equipment in terms of knowledge experience and tem
perament

note on the concept of risk

it is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good
preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common
stocks from this was derived the popular prejudice against com
mon stocks because they are not safe which was demonstrated
in  the  federal  reserve  boards  survey  of  1948  we  should  like  to
point out that the words risk and safety are applied to securi
ties in two different senses with a resultant confusion in thought

a bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or
principal payments similarly if a preferred stock or even a com
mon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi
dend  will  be  continued  then  a  reduction  or  passing  of  the
dividend  means  that  it  has  proved  unsafe  it  is  also  true  that  an
investment  contains  a  risk  if  there  is  a  fair  possibility  that  the
holder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost
nevertheless the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos
sible decline in the price of a security even though the decline may
be of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder
is unlikely to be forced to sell at such times these chances are pres
ent in all securities other than united states savings bonds and to
a greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior
issues as a class but we believe that what is here involved is not a
true  risk  in  the  useful  sense  of  the  term  the  man  who  holds  a
mortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he
were  forced  to  sell  it  at  an  unfavorable  time  that  element  is  not
taken  into  account  in  judging  the  safety  or  risk  of  ordinary  real
estate mortgages the only criterion being the certainty of punctual
payments in the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com
mercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money not
by what would happen if the owner were forced to sell

in chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide
investor does not lose money merely because the market price of
his holdings declines hence the fact that a decline may occur does

122

the intelligent investor

not mean that he is running a true risk of loss if a group of well
selected  commonstock  investments  shows  a  satisfactory  overall
return  as  measured  through  a  fair  number  of  years  then  this
group investment has proved to be safe during that period its
market value is bound to fluctuate and as likely as not it will sell
for a while under the buyers cost if that fact makes the investment
risky it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the
same time this confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept
of  risk  solely  to  a  loss  of  value  which  either  is  realized  through
actual  sale  or  is  caused  by  a  significant  deterioration  in  the
companys  positionor  more  frequently  perhaps  is  the  result  of
the payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth
of the security2

many common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration but
it is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com
mon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that
therefore it should not be termed risky merely because of the ele
ment of price fluctuation but such risk is present if there is danger
that the price may prove to have been clearly too high by intrinsic
value  standardseven  if  any  subsequent  severe  market  decline
may be recouped many years later

note on the category of large prominent 
and conservatively financed corporations

the quoted phrase in our caption was used earlier in the chapter
to  describe  the  kind  of  common  stocks  to  which  defensive
investors  should  limit  their  purchasesprovided  also  that  they
had paid continuous dividends for a considerable number of years
a criterion based on adjectives is always ambiguous where is the
dividing  line  for  size  for  prominence  and  for  conservatism  of
financial structure on the last point we can suggest a specific stan
dard  that  though  arbitrary  is  in  line  with  accepted  thinking an
industrial companys finances are not conservative unless the com
mon stock at book value represents at least half of the total capi
talization including all bank debt3 for a railroad or public utility
the figure should be at least 30

the words large and prominent carry the notion of substan
tial  size  combined  with  a  leading  position  in  the  industry  such

the defensive investor and common stocks

123

companies  are  often  referred  to  as  primary  all  other  common
stocks  are  then  called  secondary  except  that  growth  stocks  are
ordinarily  placed  in  a  separate  class  by  those  who  buy  them  as
such to supply an element of concreteness here let us suggest that
to be large in presentday terms a company should have 50 mil
lion  of  assets  or  do  50  million  of  business again  to  be  promi
nent a company should rank among the first quarter or first third
in size within its industry group

it would be foolish however to insist upon such arbitrary crite
ria  they  are  offered  merely  as  guides  to  those  who  may  ask  for
guidance but any rule which the investor may set for himself and
which does no violence to the commonsense meanings of large
and  prominent  should  be  acceptable  by  the  very  nature  of  the
case there must be a large group of companies that some will and
others will not include among those suitable for defensive invest
ment there is no harm in such diversity of opinion and action in
fact it has a salutary effect upon stockmarket conditions because
it permits a gradual differentiation or transition between the cate
gories of primary and secondary stock issues

 in todays markets to be considered large a company should have a total
stock value or market capitalization of at least 10 billion according to
the online stock screener at httpscreenyahoocomstockshtml that gave
you roughly 300 stocks to choose from as of early 2003

after the stockmarket bloodbath of the past few years why would any
defensive investor put a dime into stocks

first remember grahams insistence that how defensive you should
be depends less on your tolerance for risk than on your willingness to
put time and energy into your portfolio and if you go about it the right
way investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds
and cash as well see in chapter 9 you can buy a stockmarket index
fund with no more effort than it takes to get dressed in the morning

amidst the bear market that began in 2000 its understandable if
you  feel  burnedand  if  in  turn  that  feeling  makes  you  determined
never  to  buy  another  stock  again  as  an  old  turkish  proverb  says
after  you  burn  your  mouth  on  hot  milk  you  blow  on  your  yogurt
because  the  crash  of  20002002  was  so  terrible  many  investors
now view stocks as scaldingly risky but paradoxically the very act of
crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market it was hot
milk before but it is roomtemperature yogurt now

viewed logically the decision of whether to own stocks today has
nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning
them a few years ago when stocks are priced reasonably enough to
give you future growth then you should own them regardless of the
losses they may have cost you in the recent past that is all the more
true when bond yields are low reducing the future returns on income
producing investments

as we have seen in chapter 3 stocks are as of early 2003 only
mildly overpriced by historical standards meanwhile at recent prices
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their
supposed  safety  is  like  a  smoker  who  thinks  he  can  protect  himself
against  lung  cancer  by  smoking  lowtar  cigarettes  no  matter  how
defensive an investor you arein grahams sense of low maintenance
or in the contemporary sense of low risktodays values mean that you
must keep at least some of your money in stocks

fortunately  its  never  been  easier  for  a  defensive  investor  to  buy
stocks and a permanent autopilot portfolio which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest
ments  can  defend  you  against  the  need  to  dedicate  a  large  part  of
your life to stock picking

but  first  let us  look  at  something  the  defensive  investor  must  always
defend against the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any
homework  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  one  of  the  most  popular
investing  slogans  was  buy  what  you  know  peter  lynchwho  from
1977 through 1990 piloted fidelity magellan to the best track record
ever compiled by a mutual fundwas the most charismatic preacher of
this gospel lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage
that professional investors have forgotten how to use the power of
common  knowledge  if  you  discover  a  great  new  restaurant  car
toothpaste or jeansor if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby
business is always full or that people are still working at a companys
headquarters long after jay leno goes off the airthen you have a per
sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man
ager  might  never  pick  up  on  as  lynch  put  it  during  a  lifetime  of
buying  cars  or  cameras  you  develop  a  sense  of  what is  good  and
what is  bad  what  sells  and  what  does not    and  the  most  important
part is you know it before wall street knows it 1

by investing in companies or industries you already understandisnt

totally  implausible  and  thousands  of  investors  have  profited  from  it
over the years but lynchs rule can work only if you follow its corollary
as well finding the promising company is only the first step the next
step  is  doing  the  research  to  his  credit  lynch  insists  that  no  one
should ever invest in a company no matter how great its products or
how crowded its parking lot without studying its financial statements
and estimating its business value

unfortunately most stock buyers have ignored that part
barbra streisand the daytrading diva personified the way people
abuse lynchs teachings in 1999 she burbled we go to starbucks
every day so i buy starbucks stock but the funny girl forgot that no
matter how much you love those tall skinny lattes you still have to ana
lyze  starbuckss  financial  statements  and  make  sure  the  stock  is not
even more overpriced than the coffee countless stock buyers made
the same mistake by loading up on shares of amazoncom because
they loved the website or buying etrade stock because it was their
own online broker

experts gave the idea credence too in an interview televised on
cnn  in  late  1999  portfolio  manager  kevin  landis  of  the  firsthand
funds  was  asked  plaintively  how  do  you  do  it  why  cannot  i  do  it

focus on the things that you know and stay close to an industry and
talk to people who work in it every day 2

the most painful perversion of lynchs rule occurred in corporate
retirement  plans  if  you are  supposed  to  buy  what  you  know  then
what could possibly be a better investment for your 401k than your
own companys stock after all you work there do not you know more
about the company than an outsider ever could sadly the employees

to put fledgling portfolios on autopilot to be sure a transaction fee of

you may often incur a variety of nuisance fees that can exceed 25

than stockbrokers

be warned however that buying stocks in tiny increments for years
on end can set off big tax headaches if you are not prepared to keep
a  permanent  and  exhaustively  detailed  record  of  your  purchases  do
not buy in the first place finally do not invest in only one stockor even
just a handful of different stocks unless you are not willing to spread
your  bets  you  should not  bet  at  all  grahams  guideline  of  owning

as the financial markets heave and crash their way up and down day
after  day  the  defensive  investor  can  take  control  of  the  chaos  your
very refusal to be active your renunciation of any pretended ability to
predict the future can become your most powerful weapons by put
ting every investment decision on autopilot you drop any selfdelusion
that  you  know  where  stocks  are  headed  and  you  take  away  the
markets power to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces

as graham notes dollarcost averaging enables you to put a fixed
amount of money into an investment at regular intervals every week
month or calendar quarter you buy morewhether the markets have
gone or are about to go up down or sideways any major mutual fund
company  or  brokerage  firm  can  automatically  and  safely  transfer  the
money electronically for you so you never have to write a check or feel
the conscious pang of payment its all out of sight out of mind

the  ideal  way  to  dollarcost  average  is  into  a  portfolio  of  index
funds  which  own  every  stock  or  bond  worth  having  that  way  you
renounce  not  only  the  guessing  game  of  where  the  market  is  going
but which sectors of the marketand which particular stocks or bonds
within themwill do the best

let us say you can spare 500 a month by owning and dollarcost

total us stock market 100 into one that holds foreign stocks and

portfolio policy for the enterprising

investor negative approach

the aggressive investor should start from the same base as the
defensive  investor  namely  a  division  of  his  funds  between  high
grade bonds and highgrade common stocks bought at reasonable
prices he will be prepared to branch out into other kinds of secu
rity  commitments  but  in  each  case  he  will  want  a  wellreasoned
justification  for  the  departure  there  is  a  difficulty  in  discussing
this topic in orderly fashion because there is no single or ideal pat
tern for aggressive operations the field of choice is wide the selec
tion should depend not only on the individuals competence and
equipment but perhaps equally well upon his interests and prefer
ences

the most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are
of a negative sort let him leave highgrade preferred stocks to cor
porate buyers let him also avoid inferior types of bonds and pre
ferred  stocks  unless  they  can  be  bought  at  bargain  levelswhich
means ordinarily at prices at least 30 under par for highcoupon

 here graham has made a slip of the tongue after insisting in chapter 1
that the definition of an enterprising investor depends not on the amount
of risk you seek but the amount of work you are willing to put in graham
falls  back  on  the  conventional  notion  that  enterprising  investors  are  more
aggressive  the  rest  of  the  chapter  however  makes  clear  that  graham
stands by his original definition the great british economist john maynard
keynes appears to have been the first to use the term enterprise as a syn
onym for analytical investment

issues and much less for the lower coupons he will let someone
else  buy  foreigngovernment  bond  issues  even  though  the  yield
may be attractive he will also be wary of all kinds of new issues
including convertible bonds and preferreds that seem quite tempt
ing  and  common  stocks  with  excellent  earnings  confined  to  the
recent past

for  standard  bond  investments  the  aggressive  investor  would
do well to follow the pattern suggested to his defensive confrere
and make his choice between highgrade taxable issues which can
now  be  selected  to  yield  about  714  and  goodquality  taxfree
bonds which yield up to 530 on longer maturities

secondgrade bonds and preferred stocks

since in late1971 it is possible to find firstrate corporate bonds
to yield 714 and even more it would not make much sense to buy
secondgrade issues merely for the higher return they offer in fact
corporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir
tually  impossible  to  sell  straight  bondsie  nonconvertibles
to the public in the past two years hence their debt financing has
been done by the sale of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants
attached which place them in a separate category it follows that
virtually  all  the  nonconvertible  bonds  of  inferior  rating  represent
older issues which are selling at a large discount thus they offer
the possibility of a substantial gain in principal value under favor
able future conditionswhich would mean here a combination of
an  improved  credit  rating  for  the  company  and  lower  general
interest rates

 highcoupon issues are corporate bonds paying aboveaverage interest
rates in todays markets at least 8 or preferred stocks paying large divi
dend yields 10 or more if a company must pay high rates of interest in
order to borrow money that is a fundamental signal that it is risky for more
on highyield or junk bonds see pp 145147
 as  of  early  2003  the  equivalent  yields  are  roughly  51  on  highgrade
corporate  bonds  and  47  on  20year  taxfree  municipal  bonds  to  up
date these yields see wwwbondsonlinecomaspnewscompositeshtml or
wwwbloombergcommarketsrateshtml and wwwbloombergcommarkets

but even in the matter of price discounts and resultant chance of
principal gain the secondgrade bonds are in competition with bet
ter  issues  some  of  the  wellentrenched  obligations  with  old
style coupon rates 212 to 4 sold at about 50 cents on the dollar
in 1970 examples american telephone  telegraph 258s due 1986
sold at 51 atchison topeka  santa fe rr 4s due 1995 sold at 51
mcgrawhill 378s due 1992 sold at 5012

hence  under  conditions  of  late1971  the  enterprising  investors
can probably get from goodgrade bonds selling at a large discount
all that he should reasonably desire in the form of both income and
chance of appreciation

throughout this book we refer to the possibility that any well
defined and protracted market situation of the past may return in
the  future  hence  we  should  consider  what  policy  the  aggressive
investor might have to choose in the bond field if prices and yields
of highgrade issues should return to former normals for this rea
son  we  shall  reprint  here  our  observations  on  that  point  made  in
the 1965 edition when highgrade bonds yielded only 412

something should be said now about investing in secondgrade
issues which can readily be found to yield any specified return up
to  8  or  more  the  main  difference  between  first  and  second
grade  bonds  is  usually  found  in  the  number  of  times  the  interest
charges  have  been  covered  by  earnings  example  in  early  1964
chicago  milwaukee  st  paul  and  pacific  5  income  debenture
bonds  at  68  yielded  735  but  the  total  interest  charges  of  the
road  before  income  taxes  were  earned  only  15  times  in  1963
against  our  requirement  of  5  times  for  a  wellprotected  railroad
issue1

many  investors  buy  securities  of  this  kind  because  they  need
income  and  cannot  get  along  with  the  meager  return  offered  by
topgrade issues experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy
a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because
the  yield  is  attractive  here  the  word  merely  implies  that  the
issue  is  not  selling  at  a  large  discount  and  thus  does  not  offer  an
opportunity for a substantial gain in principal value where such
securities are bought at full pricesthat is not many points under

 for a recent example that painfully reinforces grahams point see p 146

the intelligent investor

100 the  chances  are  very  great  that  at  some  future  time  the
holder  will  see  much  lower  quotations  for  when  bad  business
comes or just a bad market issues of this kind prove highly sus
ceptible  to  severe  sinking  spells  often  interest  or  dividends  are 
suspended  or  at  least  endangered  and  frequently  there  is  a  pro
nounced price weakness even though the operating results are not
at all bad

as a specific illustration of this characteristic of secondquality
senior issues let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten
railroad income bonds in 194647 these comprise all of those which
sold at 96 or more in 1946 their high prices averaging 10212 by the
following year the group had registered low prices averaging only
68  a  loss  of  onethird  of  the  market  value  in  a  very  short  time
peculiarly  enough  the  railroads  of  the  country  were  showing
much better earnings in 1947 than in 1946 hence the drastic price
decline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of
the selloff in the general market but it should be pointed out that
the  shrinkage  in  these  income  bonds  was  proportionately  larger
than  that  in  the  common  stocks in  the  dow  jones  industrial  list
about  23  obviously  the  purchaser  of  these  bonds  at  a  cost
above 100 could not have expected to participate to any extent in a
further rise in the securities market the only attractive feature was
the  income  yield  averaging  about  425  against  250  for  first
grade  bonds  an  advantage  of  175  in  annual  income  yet  the
sequel  showed  all  too  soon  and  too  plainly  that  for  the  minor
advantage  in  annual  income  the  buyer  of  these  secondgrade
bonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal

the above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu
lar  fallacy  that  goes  under  the  sobriquet  of  a  businessmans
investment  that  involves  the  purchase  of  a  security  showing  a
larger yield than is obtainable on a highgrade issue and carrying 
a  correspondingly  greater  risk  it  is  bad  business  to  accept  an

 bond  prices  are  quoted  in  percentages  of  par  value  or  100  a  bond
priced  at  85  is  selling  at  85  of  its  principal  value  a  bond  originally
offered for 10000 but now selling at 85 will cost 8500 when bonds
sell below 100 they are called discount bonds above 100 they become
premium bonds

acknowledged  possibility  of  a  loss  of  principal  in  exchange  for  a
mere  1  or  2  of  additional  yearly  income  if  you  are  willing  to
assume  some  risk  you  should  be  certain  that  you  can  realize  a
really substantial gain in principal value if things go well hence a
secondgrade 55 or 6 bond selling at par is almost always a bad
purchase the same issue at 70 might make more senseand if you
are patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level

secondgrade  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  possess  two  contra
dictory  attributes  which  the  intelligent  investor  must  bear  clearly
in mind nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets on
the  other  hand  a  large  proportion  recover  their  position  when
favorable  conditions  return  and  these  ultimately  work  out  all
right this is true even of cumulative preferred stocks that fail to
pay dividends for many years there were a number of such issues
in the early 1940s as a consequence of the long depression of the
1930s  during  the  postwar  boom  period  of  19451947  many  of
these  large  accumulations  were  paid  off  either  in  cash  or  in  new
securities  and  the  principal  was  often  discharged  as  well  as  a
result large profits were made by people who a few years previ
ously had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold
at low prices2

it  may  well  be  true  that  in  an  overall  accounting  the  higher
yields obtainable on secondgrade senior issues will prove to have
offset  those  principal  losses  that  were  irrecoverable  in  other
words  an  investor  who  bought  all  such  issues  at  their  offering
prices might conceivably fare as well in the long run as one who
limited himself to firstquality securities or even somewhat better3
but  for  practical  purposes  the  question  is  largely  irrelevant
regardless of the outcome the buyer of secondgrade issues at full
prices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines
precipitately furthermore he cannot buy enough issues to assure
an average result nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of
his  larger  income  to  offset  or  amortize  those  principal  losses
which prove to be permanent finally it is mere common sense to
abstain  from  buying  securities  at  around  100  if  long  experience
indicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next
weak market

foreign government bonds

all  investors  with  even  small  experience  know  that  foreign
bonds as a whole have had a bad investment history since 1914
this was inevitable in the light of two world wars and an interven
ing  world  depression  of  unexampled  depth  yet  every  few  years
market  conditions  are  sufficiently  favorable  to  permit  the  sale  of
some new foreign issues at a price of about par this phenomenon
tells  us  a  good  deal  about  the  working  of  the  average  investors
mindand not only in the field of bonds

we have no concrete reason to be concerned about the future his
tory  of  wellregarded  foreign  bonds  such  as  those  of australia  or
norway but we do know that if and when trouble should come
the  owner  of  foreign  obligations  has  no  legal  or  other  means  of
enforcing  his  claim  those  who  bought  republic  of  cuba  412s  as
high as 117 in 1953 saw them default their interest and then sell as
low  as  20  cents  on  the  dollar  in  1963  the  new  york  stock
exchange bond list in that year also included belgian congo 514s at
36 greek 7s at 30 and various issues of poland as low as 7 how
many readers have any idea of the repeated vicissitudes of the 8
bonds of czechoslovakia since they were first offered in this coun
try in 1922 at 9612 they advanced to 112 in 1928 declined to 6734 in
1932  recovered  to  106  in  1936  collapsed  to  6  in  1939  recovered
unbelievably to 117 in 1946 fell promptly to 35 in 1948 and sold
as low as 8 in 1970

years  ago  an  argument  of  sorts  was  made  for  the  purchase  of
foreign bonds here on the grounds that a rich creditor nation such
as  ours  was  under  moral  obligation  to  lend  abroad  time  which
brings so many revenges now finds us dealing with an intractable
balanceofpayments problem of our own part of which is ascrib
able  to  the  largescale  purchase  of  foreign  bonds  by  american
investors seeking a small advantage in yield for many years past
we  have  questioned  the  inherent  attractiveness  of  such  invest
ments  from  the  standpoint  of  the  buyer  perhaps  we  should  add
now that the latter would benefit both his country and himself if he
declined these opportunities

new issues generally

it might seem illadvised to attempt any broad statements about
new issues as a class since they cover the widest possible range of
quality and attractiveness certainly there will be exceptions to any
suggested  rule  our  one  recommendation  is  that  all  investors
should  be  wary of  new  issueswhich  means  simply  that  these
should  be  subjected  to  careful  examination  and  unusually  severe
tests before they are purchased

there  are  two  reasons  for  this  double  caveat  the  first  is  that
new  issues  have  special  salesmanship  behind  them  which  calls
therefore for a special degree of sales resistance the second is that
most  new  issues  are  sold  under  favorable  market  conditions
which means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor
able for the buyer

the effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor
tant  as  we  go  down  the  scale  from  the  highestquality  bonds
through secondgrade senior issues to commonstock flotations at
the  bottom a tremendous  amount  of  financing  consisting  of  the
repayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by
new issues with lower coupons was done in the past most of this
was in the category of highgrade bonds and preferred stocks the
buyers were largely financial institutions amply qualified to pro
tect  their  interests  hence  these  offerings  were  carefully  priced  to

 new issues of common stockinitial public offerings or iposnormally are
sold with an underwriting discount a builtin commission of 7 by con
trast  the  buyers  commission  on  older  shares  of  common  stock  typically
ranges below 4 whenever wall street makes roughly twice as much for
selling something new as it does for selling something old the new will get
the harder sell
 recently  finance  professors  owen  lamont  of  the  university  of  chicago
and paul schultz of the university of notre dame have shown that corpora
tions choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near
a peak for technical discussion of these issues see lamonts evaluating
value  weighting  corporate  events  and  market  timing  and  schultzs

meet  the  going  rate  for  comparable  issues  and  highpowered
salesmanship had little effect on the outcome as interest rates fell
lower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for
these  issues  and  many  of  them  later  declined  appreciably  in  the
market this is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu
rities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer
but in the case of firstquality issues the ill effects to the purchaser
are likely to be unpleasant rather than serious

the  situation  proves  somewhat  different  when  we  study  the
lowergrade  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  sold  during  the  194546
and  196061  periods  here  the  effect  of  the  selling  effort  is  more
apparent because most of these issues were probably placed with
individual  and  inexpert  investors  it  was  characteristic  of  these
offerings  that  they  did  not  make  an  adequate  showing  when
judged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num
ber  of  years  they  did  look  safe  enough  for  the  most  part  if  it
could be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without
a serious setback the investment bankers who brought out these
issues  presumably  accepted  this  assumption  and  their  salesmen
had little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers
to a like effect nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest
ment and one likely to prove costly

bullmarket  periods  are  usually  characterized  by  the  transfor
mation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com
panies with quoted shares this was the case in 194546 and again
beginning in 1960 the process then reached extraordinary propor
tions  until  brought  to  a  catastrophic  close  in  may  1962 after  the
usual  swearingoff  period  of  several  years  the  whole  tragicom
edy was repeated step by step in 19671969

 in the two years from june 1960 through may 1962 more than 850 com
panies sold their stock to the public for the first timean average of more than
one per day in late 1967 the ipo market heated up again in 1969 an aston
ishing 781 new stocks were born that oversupply helped create the bear
markets of 1969 and 19731974 in 1974 the ipo market was so dead that
only nine new stocks were created all year 1975 saw only 14 stocks born
that undersupply in turn helped feed the bull market of the 1980s when
roughly 4000 new stocks flooded the markethelping to trigger the over

new commonstock offerings

the following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the

1959 edition with comment added

commonstock financing takes two different forms in the case
of companies already listed additional shares are offered pro rata
to  the  existing  stockholders  the  subscription  price  is  set  below 
the  current  market  and  the  rights  to  subscribe  have  an  initial
money value the sale of the new shares is almost always under
written  by  one  or  more  investment  banking  houses  but  it  is  the
general hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken
by  the  exercise  of  the  subscription  rights  thus  the  sale  of  addi
tional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call
for active selling effort on the part of distributing firms

the  second  type  is  the  placement  with  the  public  of  common
stock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises most of
this  stock  is  sold  for  the  account  of  the  controlling  interests  to
enable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their

enthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash then the cycle swung the other way
again as ipos dried up in 19881990 that shortage contributed to the bull
market of the 1990sand right on cue wall street got back into the busi
ness of creating new stocks cranking out nearly 5000 ipos then after the
bubble burst in 2000 only 88 ipos were issued in 2001the lowest annual
total since 1979 in every case the public has gotten burned on ipos has
stayed away for at least two years but has always returned for another scald
ing for as long as stock markets have existed investors have gone through
this manicdepressive cycle in americas first great ipo boom back in 1825
a man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu
lators trying to buy shares in the new bank of southwark the wealthiest buy
ers hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line sure enough by
1829 stocks had lost roughly 25 of their value
 here graham is describing rights offerings in which investors who already
own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same
proportional interest in the company this form of financing still widespread
in europe has become rare in the united states except among closedend

own  finances  when  new  money  is  raised  for  the  business  it
comes  often  via  the  sale  of  preferred  stock  as  previously  noted
this activity follows a welldefined pattern which by the nature of
the security markets must bring many losses and disappointments
to  the  public  the  dangers  arise  both  from  the  character  of  the
businesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions
that make the financing possible

in the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading
companies were introduced to public trading as time went on the
number  of  enterprises  of  first  rank  that  remained  closely  held
steadily diminished hence original commonstock flotations have
tended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con
cerns  by  an  unfortunate  correlation  during  the  same  period  the
stockbuying public has been developing an ingrained preference
for the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor
ones this prejudice like many others tends to become weaker as
bull  markets  are  built  up  the  large  and  quick  profits  shown  by
common stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the publics critical
faculty  just  as  they  sharpen  its  acquisitive  instinct  during  these
periods also quite a number of privately owned concerns can be
found that are enjoying excellent resultsalthough most of these
would not present too impressive a record if the figures were car
ried back say ten years or more

when these factors are put together the following consequences
emerge  somewhere  in  the  middle  of  the  bull  market  the  first 
commonstock  flotations  make  their  appearance  these  are  priced
not unattractively and some large profits are made by the buyers of
the early issues as the market rise continues this brand of financing
grows more frequent the quality of the companies becomes steadily
poorer the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant one
fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the
fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies
are  offered  at  prices  somewhat  higher  than  the  current  level  for
many  mediumsized  companies  with  a  long  market  history  it
should be added that very little of this commonstock financing is
ordinarily done by banking houses of prime size and reputation

 in grahams day the most prestigious investment banks generally steered
clear of the ipo business which was regarded as an undignified exploita

the  heedlessness  of  the  public  and  the  willingness  of  selling
organizations  to  sell  whatever  may  be  profitably  sold  can  have
only one resultprice collapse in many cases the new issues lose
75 and more of their offering price the situation is worsened by
the aforementioned fact that at bottom the public has a real aver
sion to the very kind of small issue that it bought so readily in its
careless  moments  many  of  these  issues  fall  proportionately  as
much below their true value as they formerly sold above it

an elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil
ity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common
stock issues during bull markets even if one or two can be found
that can pass severe tests of quality and value it is probably bad pol
icy to get mixed up in this sort of business of course the salesman
will point to many such issues which have had goodsized market
advancesincluding some that go up spectacularly the very day
they are sold but all this is part of the speculative atmosphere it is
easy money for every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky
if you end up by losing only two

some  of  these  issues  may  prove  excellent  buysa  few  years
later  when  nobody  wants  them  and  they  can  be  had  at  a  small
fraction of their true worth

in the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject

as follows

while the broader aspects of the stock markets behavior since
1949 have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long expe
rience  the  development  of  new  commonstock  flotations  pro
ceeded  exactly  in  accordance  with  ancient  prescription  it  is
doubtful whether we ever before had so many new issues offered
of such low quality and with such extreme price collapses as we

2000 however wall streets biggest investment banks had jumped in with

stocks on a desperately eager public grahams description of how the ipo
process  works  is  a  classic  that  should  be  required  reading  in  investment
banking ethics classes if there are any

experienced  in  196019624 the  ability  of  the  stock  market  as  a
whole  to  disengage  itself  rapidly  from  that  disaster  is  indeed  an
extraordinary phenomenon bringing back longburied memories
of  the  similar  invulnerability  it  showed  to  the  great  florida  real
estate collapse in 1925

must  there  be  a  return  of  the  newstockoffering  madness
before  the  present  bull  market  can  come  to  its  definitive  close
who knows but we do know that an intelligent investor will not
forget  what  happened  in  1962  and  will  let  others  make  the  next
batch  of  quick  profits  in  this  area  and  experience  the  consequent
harrowing losses

we followed these paragraphs in the 1965 edition by citing a
horrible example namely the sale of stock of aetna maintenance
co at 9 in november 1961 in typical fashion the shares promptly
advanced to 15 the next year they fell to 238 and in 1964 to 78 the
later  history  of  this  company  was  on  the  extraordinary  side  and
illustrates  some  of  the  strange  metamorphoses  that  have  taken
place  in american  business  great  and  small  in  recent  years  the
curious reader will find the older and newer history of this enter
prise in appendix 5

it  is  by  no  means  difficult  to  provide  even  more  harrowing
examples  taken  from  the  more  recent  version  of  the  same  old
story which covered the years 19671970 nothing could be more
pat to our purpose than the case of aaa enterprises which hap
pens to be the first company then listed in standard  poors stock
guide the shares were sold to the public at 14 in 1968 promptly
advanced  to  28  but  in  early  1971  were  quoted  at  a  dismal  25
even  this  price  represented  a  gross  overvaluation  of  the  enter
prise since it had just entered the bankruptcy court in a hopeless
condition  there  is  so  much  to  be  learned  and  such  important
warnings  to  be  gleaned  from  the  story  of  this  flotation  that  we
have reserved it for detailed treatment below in chapter 17

for the aggressive as well as the defensive investor what you do not

do  is  as  important  to  your  success  as  what  you  do  in  this  chapter

highyield  bondswhich  graham  calls  secondgrade  or  lower
grade  and  today  are  called  junk  bondsget  a  brisk  thumbsdown
from graham in his day it was too costly and cumbersome for an indi
vidual investor to diversify away the risks of default1 to learn how bad
a  default  can  be  and  how  carelessly  even  sophisticated  profes
sional  bond  investors  can  buy  into  one  see  the  sidebar  on  p  146
today however more than 130 mutual funds specialize in junk bonds
these  funds  buy  junk  by  the  cartload  they  hold  dozens  of  different
bonds  that  mitigates  grahams  complaints  about  the  difficulty  of
diversifying  however his  bias  against  highyield  preferred  stock
remains valid since there remains no cheap and widely available way
to spread their risks

since  1978  an  annual  average  of  44  of  the  junkbond  market
has gone into defaultbut even after those defaults junk bonds have

1 in  the  early  1970s  when  graham  wrote  there  were  fewer  than  a  dozen
junkbond  funds  nearly  all  of  which  charged  sales  commissions  of  up  to
85 some even made investors pay a fee for the privilege of reinvesting
their monthly dividends back into the fund

buying a bond only for its yield is like getting married only for the
sex  if  the  thing  that  attracted  you  in  the  first  place  dries  up
you will  find  yourself  asking  what  else  is  there  when  the
answer is nothing spouses and bondholders alike end up with
broken hearts

on  may  9  2001  worldcom  inc  sold  the  biggest  offering 
of bonds in us corporate history119 billion worth among
the  eager  beavers  attracted  by  the  yields  of  up  to  83  were
the california public employees retirement system one of the
worlds largest pension funds retirement systems of alabama
whose  managers  later  explained  that  the  higher  yields  were
very attractive to us at the time they were purchased and the
strong corporate bond fund whose comanager was so fond
of  worldcoms  fat  yield  that  he  boasted  were  getting  paid
more than enough extra income for the risk 1

but even a 30second glance at worldcoms bond prospec
tus would have shown that these bonds had nothing to offer but
their  yieldand  everything  to  lose  in  two  of  the  previous  five
years worldcoms pretax income the companys profits before
it paid its dues to the irs fell short of covering its fixed charges
the  costs  of  paying  interest  to  its  bondholders  by  a  stupen
dous 41 billion worldcom could cover those bond payments
only by borrowing more money from banks and now with this
mountainous  new  helping  of  bonds  worldcom  was  fattening
its  interest  costs  by  another  900  million  per  year2 like  mr
creosote  in  monty  pythons  the  meaning  of  life worldcom
was gorging itself to the bursting point

no yield could ever be high enough to compensate an investor
for risking that kind of explosion the worldcom bonds did pro
duce fat yields of up to 8 for a few months then as graham
would have predicted the yield suddenly offered no shelter

 worldcom filed bankruptcy in july 2002
 worldcom  admitted  in  august  2002  that  it  had  overstated

its earnings by more than 7 billion3

graham considered foreign bonds no better a bet than junk bonds3
today however one variety of foreign bond may have some appeal for
investors  who  can  withstand  plenty  of  risk  roughly  a  dozen  mutual
funds specialize in bonds issued in emergingmarket nations or what
used to be called third world countries like brazil mexico nigeria
russia and venezuela no sane investor would put more than 10 of
a  total  bond  portfolio  in  spicy  holdings  like  these  but  emerging
markets bond funds seldom move in synch with the us stock market
so they are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely
because the dow is down that can give you a small corner of comfort
in your portfolio just when you may need it most4

as we have already seen in chapter 1 day tradingholding stocks for a
few hours at a timeis one of the best weapons ever invented for com
mitting financial suicide some of your trades might make money most
of  your  trades  will  lose  money  but  your  broker  will  always  make
money

and  your  own  eagerness  to  buy  or  sell  a  stock  can  lower  your
return someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up
having to bid 10 cents higher than the most recent share price before
any sellers will be willing to part with it that extra cost called market
impact never shows up on your brokerage statement but its real if
you are overeager to buy 1000 shares of a stock and you drive its price

early in his career acting as a new yorkbased bond agent for borrowers in
japan

up by just five cents you have just cost yourself an invisible but very real
50 on the flip side when panicky investors are frantic to sell a stock
and  they  dump  it  for  less  than  the  most  recent  price  market  impact
hits home again

the costs of trading wear away your returns like so many swipes of
sandpaper buying or selling a hot little stock can cost 2 to 4 or
4  to  8  for  a  roundtrip  buyandsell  transaction5 if  you  put
1000  into  a  stock  your  trading  costs  could  eat  up  roughly  40
before  you  even  get  started  sell  the  stock  and  you  could  fork  over
another 4 in trading expenses

oh yestheres one other thing when you trade instead of invest
you  turn  longterm  gains  taxed  at  a  maximum  capitalgains  rate  of
20 into ordinary income taxed at a maximum rate of 386

add it all up and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10 just to
break even on buying and selling a stock6 anyone can do that once
by luck alone to do it often enough to justify the obsessive attention it
requiresplus the nightmarish stress it generatesis impossible

thousands  of  people  have  tried  and  the  evidence  is  clear  the

more you trade the less you keep

finance professors brad barber and terrance odean of the univer

customers  of  a  major  discount  brokerage  firm  from  1991  through
1996  these  clients  made  more  than  19  million  trades  before  the
costs of trading sandpapered away at their returns the people in the
study actually outperformed the market by an average of at least half a
percentage point per year but after trading costs the most active of

for  everyone  to  acknowledge  that  the  term  longterm  investor  is

among the getrichquick toxins that poisoned the mind of the invest
ing public in the 1990s one of the most lethal was the idea that you
can build wealth by buying ipos an ipo is an initial public offering
or  the  first  sale  of  a  companys  stock  to  the  public  at  first  blush
investing  in  ipos  sounds  like  a  great  ideaafter  all  if  you would  bought
100 shares of microsoft when it went public on march 13 1986 your
2100  investment  would  have  grown  to  720000  by  early  20038
and  finance  professors  jay  ritter  and  william  schwert  have  shown
that if you had spread a total of only 1000 across every ipo in janu
ary  1960  at  its  offering  price  sold  out  at  the  end  of  that  month 
then  invested  anew  in  each  successive  months  crop  of  ipos  your

cal impossibility finally most of the high returns on ipos are captured
by  members  of  an  exclusive  private  clubthe  big  investment  banks
and fund houses that get shares at the initial or underwriting price
before  the  stock  begins  public  trading  the  biggest  runups  often
occur  in  stocks  so  small  that  even  many  big  investors  cannot  get  any
shares there just are not enough to go around

if like nearly every investor you can get access to ipos only after
their  shares  have  rocketed  above  the  exclusive  initial  price  your
results  will  be  terrible  from  1980  through  2001  if  you  had  bought
the average ipo at its first public closing price and held on for three
years  you  would  have  underperformed  the  market  by  more  than  23
percentage points annually9

perhaps  no  stock  personifies  the  pipe  dream  of  getting  rich  from
ipos better than va linux lnux the next msft exulted an early
owner buy now and retire in five years from now 10
on december 9 1999 the stock was placed at an initial public offer
ing  price  of  30  but  demand  for  the  shares  was  so  ferocious  that
when nasdaq opened that morning none of the initial owners of va
linux  would  let  go  of  any  shares  until  the  price  hit  299  the  stock
peaked at 320 and closed at 23925 a gain of 6975 in a single
day but that gain was earned by only a handful of institutional traders
individual investors were almost entirely frozen out

more important buying ipos is a bad idea because it flagrantly vio
lates one of grahams most fundamental rules no matter how many
other people want to buy a stock you should buy only if the stock is a
cheap way to own a desirable business at the peak price on day one
investors  were  valuing  va  linuxs  shares  at  a  total  of  127  billion
what  was  the  companys  business  worth  less  than  five  years  old

would you instead smile politely turn back to your barbecue grill and
wonder  what  on  earth  your  neighbor  had  been  smoking  relying
exclusively on our own judgment none of us would be caught dead

30 million in the hole

but when were in public instead of in private when valuation sud
denly becomes a popularity contest the price of a stock seems more
important  than  the  value  of  the  business  it  represents  as  long  as
someone else will pay even more than you did for a stock why does it

portfolio policy for the enterprising

the enterprising investor by definition will devote a fair amount
of his attention and efforts toward obtaining a better than runof
themill investment result in our discussion of general investment
policy we have made some suggestions regarding bond investments
that are addressed chiefly to the enterprising investor he might be
interested in special opportunities of the following kinds

1 taxfree new housing authority bonds effectively guaranteed

by the united states government

2 taxable but highyielding new community bonds also guar

anteed by the united states government

3 taxfree  industrial  bonds  issued  by  municipalities  but  ser

viced by lease payments made by strong corporations

references  have  been  made  to  these  unusual  types  of  bond

issues in chapter 4

at  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  there  may  be  lowerquality
bonds  obtainable  at  such  low  prices  as  to  constitute  true  bargain
opportunities  but  these  would  belong  in  the  special  situation
area where no true distinction exists between bonds and common
stocks

 as already noted see p 96 footnote  the new housing authority and
new community bonds are no longer issued
 today  these  lowerquality  bonds  in  the  special  situation  area  are
known  as  distressed  or  defaulted  bonds  when  a  company  is  in  or

operations in common stocks

the activities specially characteristic of the enterprising investor

in the commonstock field may be classified under four heads

1 buying in low markets and selling in high markets
2 buying carefully chosen growth stocks
3 buying bargain issues of various types
4 buying into special situations

general market policyformula timing

we reserve for the next chapter our discussion of the possibili
ties  and  limitations  of  a  policy  of  entering  the  market  when  it  is
depressed  and  selling  out  in  the  advanced  stages  of  a  boom  for
many years in the past this bright idea appeared both simple and
feasible at least from first inspection of a market chart covering its
periodic  fluctuations  we  have  already  admitted  ruefully  that  the
markets action in the past 20 years has not lent itself to operations
of this sort on any mathematical basis the fluctuations that have
taken  place  while  not  inconsiderable  in  extent  would  have
required a special talent or feel for trading to take advantage of
them this is something quite different from the intelligence which
we are assuming in our readers and we must exclude operations
based on such skill from our terms of reference

the  5050  plan  which  we  proposed  to  the  defensive  investor
and described on p 90 is about the best specific or automatic for
mula  we  can  recommend  to  all  investors  under  the  conditions  of
1972 but we have retained a broad leeway between the 25 mini

approaching bankruptcy its common stock becomes essentially worthless
since  us  bankruptcy  law  entitles  bondholders  to  a  much  stronger  legal
claim  than  shareholders  but  if  the  company  reorganizes  successfully  and
comes  out  of  bankruptcy  the  bondholders  often  receive  stock  in  the  new
firm and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is able
to pay interest again thus the bonds of a troubled company can perform
almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company in these special
situations as graham puts it no true distinction exists between bonds and
common stocks

mum and the 75 maximum in common stocks which we allow to
those investors who have strong convictions about either the dan
ger or the attractiveness of the general market level some 20 years
ago it was possible to discuss in great detail a number of clearcut
formulas for varying the percentage held in common stocks with
confidence that these plans had practical utility1 the times seem to
have passed such approaches by and there would be little point in
trying  to  determine  new  levels  for  buying  and  selling  out  of  the
market patterns since 1949 that is too short a period to furnish any
reliable guide to the future

growthstock approach

every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that
will  do  better  than  the  average  over  a  period  of  years a growth
stock  may  be  defined  as  one  that  has  done  this  in  the  past  and 
is expected to do so in the future2 thus it seems only logical that
the  intelligent  investor  should  concentrate  upon  the  selection  of
growth stocks actually the matter is more complicated as we shall
try to show

it is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have out
performed the averages in the past the investor can obtain a list of
50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker why then should he
not merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this
group and lo he has a guaranteedsuccessful stock portfolio

 note very carefully what graham is saying here writing in 1972 he con
tends that the period since 1949a stretch of more than 22 yearsis too
short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions with his mastery of
mathematics graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very
long samples of large amounts of data the charlatans who peddle time
tested stockpicking gimmicks almost always base their findings on smaller
samples than graham would ever accept graham often used 50year peri
ods to analyze past data
 today the enterprising investor can assemble such a list over the internet
by visiting such websites as wwwmorningstarcom try the stock quickrank
tool  wwwquickencominvestmentsstockssearchfull  and  httpyahoo
marketguidecom

the intelligent investor

there are two catches to this simple idea the first is that com
mon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell
at  correspondingly  high  prices  the  investor  may  be  right  in  his
judgment  of  their  prospects  and  still  not  fare  particularly  well
merely because he has paid in full and perhaps overpaid for the
expected  prosperity  the  second  is  that  his  judgment  as  to  the
future may prove wrong unusually rapid growth cannot keep up
forever when a company has already registered a brilliant expan
sion its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement
more difficult at some point the growth curve flattens out and in
many cases it turns downward

it  is  obvious  that  if  one  confines  himself  to  a  few  chosen
instances based on hindsight he could demonstrate that fortunes
can readily be either made or lost in the growthstock field how
can one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here we think
that  reasonably  sound  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  a  study  of
the  results  achieved  by  the  investment  funds  specializing  in  the
growthstock  approach  the  authoritative  manual  entitled  invest
ment  companies published  annually  by  arthur  wiesenberger  
company  members  of  the  new  york  stock  exchange  computes
the annual performance of some 120 such growth funds over a

there is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent
investor even with much devoted effort can derive better results
over the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the invest
ment  companies  specializing  in  this  area  surely  these  organiza
tions  have  more  brains  and  better  research  facilities  at  their
disposal than you do consequently we should advise against the
usual  type  of  growthstock  commitment  for  the  enterprising
investor this is one in which the excellent prospects are fully rec
ognized  in  the  market  and  already  reflected  in  a  current  price
earnings  ratio  of  say  higher  than  20  for  the  defensive  investor
we suggested an upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average
earnings of the past seven years the two criteria would be about
equivalent in most cases

stocks  that  will  outperform  the  market  in  the  future  or  is  it  that  the  high
costs of running the average fund whether it buys growth or value compa
nies exceed any extra return the managers can earn with their stock picks

different investment styles can be see wwwcallancomresourceperiodic
tablepertablepdf
 graham makes this point to remind you that an enterprising investor is
not one who takes more risk than average or who buys aggressive growth
stocks an enterprising investor is simply one who is willing to put in extra
time and effort in researching his or her portfolio
 notice that graham insists on calculating the priceearnings ratio based
on a multiyear average of past earnings that way you lower the odds that
you will overestimate a companys value based on a temporarily high burst
of profitability imagine that a company earned 3 per share over the past
12 months but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six
years which numberthe sudden 3 or the steady 50 centsis more likely
to represent a sustainable trend at 25 times the 3 it earned in the most
recent year the stock would be priced at 75 but at 25 times the average
earnings  of  the  past  seven  years  6  in  total  earnings  divided  by  seven
equals 857 cents per share in average annual earnings the stock would
be priced at only 2143 which number you pick makes a big difference
finally  its  worth  noting  that  the  prevailing  method  on  wall  street  today
basing  priceearnings  ratios  primarily  on  next  years  earningswould  be

the intelligent investor

the  striking  thing  about  growth  stocks  as  a  class  is  their  ten
dency  toward  wide  swings  in  market  price  this  is  true  of  the
largest and longestestablished companiessuch as general elec
tric  and  international  business  machinesand  even  more  so  of
newer and smaller successful companies they illustrate our thesis
that the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been
the injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com
panies which have scored the most brilliant successes and which
themselves  would  be  entitled  to  a  high  investment  rating  their
credit standing is of the best and they pay the lowest interest rates
on  their  borrowings  the  investment  caliber  of  such  a  company
may not change over a long span of years but the risk characteris
tics of its stock will depend on what happens to it in the stock mar
ket the more enthusiastic the public grows about it and the faster
its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings the
riskier a proposition it becomes

but is it not true the reader may ask that the really big fortunes
from  common  stocks  have  been  garnered  by  those  who  made  a
substantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose
future  they  had  great  confidence  and  who  held  their  original
shares  unwaveringly  while  they  increased  100fold  or  more  in
value  the  answer  is  yes  but  the  big  fortunes  from  single
company investments are almost always realized by persons who

anathema to graham how can you value a company based on earnings it
has not  even  generated  yet  that is  like  setting  house  prices  based  on  a
rumor that cinderella will be building her new castle right around the corner
 recent  examples  hammer  grahams  point  home  on  september  21
2000 intel corp the maker of computer chips announced that it expected
its  revenues  to  grow  by  up  to  5  in  the  next  quarter  at  first  blush  that
sounds  great  most  big  companies  would  be  delighted  to  increase  their
sales  by  5  in  just  three  months  but  in  response  intels  stock  dropped
22 a oneday loss of nearly 91 billion in total value why wall streets
analysts  had  expected  intels  revenue  to  rise  by  up  to  10  similarly  on
february  21  2001  emc  corp  a  datastorage  firm  announced  that  it
expected its revenues to grow by at least 25 in 2001but that a new cau
tion among customers may lead to longer selling cycles on that whiff of

the intelligent investor

have  a  close  relationship  with  the  particular  companythrough
employment family connection etcwhich justifies them in plac
ing a large part of their resources in one medium and holding on 
to  this  commitment  through  all  vicissitudes  despite  numerous
temptations  to  sell  out  at  apparently  high  prices  along  the  way 
an  investor  without  such  close  personal  contact  will  constantly 
be  faced  with  the  question  of  whether  too  large  a  portion  of 
his funds are in this one medium each declinehowever tempo
rary  it  proves  in  the  sequelwill  accentuate  his  problem  and
internal and external pressures are likely to force him to take what
seems  to  be  a  goodly  profit  but  one  far  less  than  the  ultimate
bonanza4

three recommended fields for enterprising investment

to obtain better than average investment results over a long pull
requires  a  policy  of  selection  or  operation  possessing  a  twofold
merit  1  it  must  meet  objective  or  rational  tests  of  underlying
soundness and 2 it must be different from the policy followed by
most investors or speculators our experience and study leads us
to recommend three investment approaches that meet these crite
ria  they  differ  rather  widely  from  one  another  and  each  may
require a different type of knowledge and temperament on the part
of those who assay it

 todays equivalent of investors who have a close relationship with the par
ticular  company  are  socalled  control  personssenior  managers  or  direc
tors who help run the company and own huge blocks of stock executives
like bill gates of microsoft or warren buffett of berkshire hathaway have
direct control over a companys destinyand outside investors want to see
these chief executives maintain their large shareholdings as a vote of confi
dence but lesssenior managers and rankandfile workers cannot influence
the companys share price with their individual decisions thus they should
not put more than a small percentage of their assets in their own employers
stock as for outside investors no matter how well they think they know the
company the same objection applies

portfolio policy for the enterprising investor the positive side

the relatively unpopular large company

if we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com
mon  stocks  which  have  been  showing  excellent  growth  or  are
glamorous for some other reason it is logical to expect that it will
undervaluerelatively  at  leastcompanies  that  are  out  of  favor
because  of  unsatisfactory  developments  of  a  temporary  nature
this may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market
and  it  suggests  an  investment  approach  that  should  prove  both
conservative and promising

the  key  requirement  here  is  that  the  enterprising  investor 
concentrate  on  the  larger  companies  that  are  going  through  a
period  of  unpopularity  while  small  companies  may  also  be 
undervalued  for  similar  reasons  and  in  many  cases  may  later
increase  their  earnings  and  share  price  they  entail  the  risk  of  a
definitive  loss  of  profitability  and  also  of  protracted  neglect  by 
the  market  in  spite  of  better  earnings  the  large  companies  thus
have  a  double  advantage  over  the  others  first  they  have  the
resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver
sity and back to a satisfactory earnings base second the market is
likely  to  respond  with  reasonable  speed  to  any  improvement
shown

a remarkable  demonstration  of  the  soundness  of  this  thesis  is
found  in  studies  of  the  price  behavior  of  the  unpopular  issues  in
the dow jones industrial average in these it was assumed that an
investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues 
in  the  djia which  were  selling  at  the  lowest  multipliers  of  their
current  or  previous  years  earnings  these  could  be  called  the
cheapest stocks in the list and their cheapness was evidently the
reflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders it was
assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of
holding periods ranging from one to five years the results of these
investments were then compared with the results shown in either
the djia as a whole or in the highest multiplier ie the most pop
ular group

the  detailed  material  we  have  available  covers  the  results  of
annual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years5 in the early
period  19171933  this  approach  proved  unprofitable  but  since
1933  the  method  has  shown  highly  successful  results  in  34  tests

made by drexel  company now drexel firestone of oneyear
holdingfrom 1937 through 1969the cheap stocks did definitely
worse than the djia in only three instances the results were about
the  same  in  six  cases  and  the  cheap  stocks  clearly  outperformed
the average in 25 years the consistently better performance of the
lowmultiplier  stocks  is  shown  table  72  by  the  average  results
for successive fiveyear periods when compared with those of the
djia and of the ten highmultipliers

the  drexel  computation  shows  further  that  an  original  invest
ment  of  10000  made  in  the  lowmultiplier  issues  in  1936  and
switched  each  year  in  accordance  with  the  principle  would  have
grown to 66900 by 1962 the same operations in highmultiplier
stocks  would  have  ended  with  a  value  of  only  25300  while  an
operation  in  all  thirty  stocks  would  have  increased  the  original
fund to 44000

average is now nicknamed the dogs of the dow approach information on

execution on a group basis as described above are both quite sim
ple  but  in  considering  individual  companies  a  special  factor  of
opposite import must sometimes to be taken into account compa
nies  that  are  inherently  speculative  because  of  widely  varying
earnings  tend  to  sell  both  at  a  relatively  high  price  and  at  a  rela
tively  low  multiplier  in  their  good  years  and  conversely  at  low
prices and high multipliers in their bad years these relationships
are illustrated in table 73 covering fluctuations of chrysler corp
common in these cases the market has sufficient skepticism as to
the continuation of the unusually high profits to value them con
servatively and conversely when earnings are low or nonexistent
note that by the arithmetic if a company earns next to nothing
its shares must sell at a high multiplier of these minuscule profits
as  it  happens  chrysler  has  been  quite  exceptional  in  the  djia
list of leading companies and hence it did not greatly affect the the
lowmultiplier calculations it would be quite easy to avoid inclu
sion of such anomalous issues in a lowmultiplier list by requiring
also that the price be low in relation to past average earnings or by
some similar test

lowmultiplier method applied to a group assumed to be bought at

the intelligent investor

the end of 1968 and revalued on june 30 1971 this time the figures
proved  quite  disappointing  showing  a  sharp  loss  for  the  low
multiplier six or ten and a good profit for the highmultiplier selec
tions  this  one  bad  instance  should  not  vitiate  conclusions  based
on 30odd experiments but its recent happening gives it a special
adverse weight perhaps the aggressive investor should start with
the lowmultiplier idea but add other quantitative and qualita
tive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio

purchase of bargain issues

we define  a  bargain  issue  as  one  which  on  the  basis  of  facts
established  by  analysis  appears  to  be  worth  considerably  more
than it is selling for the genus includes bonds and preferred stocks
selling well under par as well as common stocks to be as concrete
as  possible  let  us  suggest  that  an  issue  is  not  a  true  bargain
unless the indicated value is at least 50 more than the price what
kind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep
ancy exists how do bargains come into existence and how does
the investor profit from them

there  are  two  tests  by  which  a  bargain  common  stock  is
detected the first is by the method of appraisal this relies largely
on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac
tor appropriate to the particular issue if the resultant value is suffi
ciently above the market priceand if the investor has confidence
in the technique employedhe can tag the stock as a bargain the
second  test  is  the  value  of  the  business  to  a  private  owner  this
value  also  is  often  determined  chiefly  by  expected  future  earn
ingsin which case the result may be identical with the first but in
the second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable
value  of  the  assets with  particular  emphasis  on  the  net  current
assets or working capital

at low points in the general market a large proportion of com
mon stocks are bargain issues as measured by these standards a
typical example was general motors when it sold at less than 30 in
1941 equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares it had been earning
in excess of 4 and paying 350 or more in dividends it is true
that  current  earnings  and  the  immediate  prospects  may  both  be
poor  but  a  levelheaded  appraisal  of  average  future  conditions

would indicate values far above ruling prices thus the wisdom of
having courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the
voice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques
of value analysis

the same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish
a bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of
many individual bargains at almost all market levels the market is
fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi
nary vicissitudes into major setbacks even a mere lack of interest
or  enthusiasm  may  impel  a  price  decline  to  absurdly  low  levels
thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua
tion 1 currently disappointing results and 2 protracted neglect
or unpopularity

however  neither  of  these  causes  if  considered  by  itself  alone
can be relied on as a guide to successful commonstock investment
how  can  we  be  sure  that  the  currently  disappointing  results  are
indeed going to be only temporary true we can supply excellent
examples  of  that  happening  the  steel  stocks  used  to  be  famous 
for  their  cyclical  quality  and  the  shrewd  buyer  could  acquire 
them  at  low  prices  when  earnings  were  low  and  sell  them  out  in
boom years at a fine profit a spectacular example is supplied by
chrysler corporation as shown by the data in table 73

if  this  were  the  standard behavior  of  stocks  with  fluctuating
earnings then making profits in the stock market would be an easy
matter unfortunately we could cite many examples of declines in

 among  the  steepest  of  the  mountains  recently  made  out  of  molehills 
in  may  1998  pfizer  inc  and  the  us  food  and  drug  administration
announced that six men taking pfizers antiimpotence drug viagra had died
of  heart  attacks  while  having  sex  pfizers  stock  immediately  went  flaccid
losing  34  in  a  single  day  on  heavy  trading  but  pfizers  shares  surged
ahead when research later showed that there was no because for alarm the
stock gained roughly a third over the next two years in late 1997 shares of
warnerlambert  co  fell  by  19  in  a  day  when  sales  of  its  new  diabetes
drug  were  temporarily  halted  in  england  within  six  months  the  stock  had
nearly doubled in late 2002 carnival corp which operates cruise ships
lost roughly 10 of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea
and vomitingon ships run by other companies

the intelligent investor

earnings  and  price  which  were  not  followed  automatically  by  a
handsome  recovery  of  both  one  such  was  anaconda  wire  and
cable which had large earnings up to 1956 with a high price of 85
in  that  year  the  earnings  then  declined  irregularly  for  six  years
the  price  fell  to  2312 in  1962  and  the  following  year  it  was  taken
over by its parent enterprise anaconda corporation at the equiv
alent of only 33

the  many  experiences  of  this  type  suggest  that  the  investor
would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price
to give him a sound basis for purchase he should require an indi
cation  of  at  least  reasonable  stability  of  earnings  over  the  past
decade  or  moreie  no  year  of  earnings  deficitplus  sufficient
size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future
the  ideal  combination  here  is  thus  that  of  a  large  and  prominent
company selling both well below its past average price and its past
average  priceearnings  multiplier  this  would  no  doubt  have
ruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as
chrysler since their lowprice years are generally accompanied by
high priceearnings ratios but let us assure the reader nowand
no doubt we shall do it againthat there is a world of difference
between  hindsight  profits  and  realmoney  profits  we  doubt
seriously  whether  the  chrysler  type  of  roller  coaster  is  a  suitable
medium for operations by our enterprising investor

we have mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec
ond because of price declines to unduly low levels a current case of
this kind would appear to be national presto industries in the bull
market of 1968 it sold at a high of 45 which was only 8 times the
561 earnings for that year the pershare profits increased in both
1969 and 1970 but the price declined to only 21 in 1970 this was
less than 4 times the record earnings in that year and less than its
netcurrentasset value in march 1972 it was selling at 34 still only
512 times the last reported earnings and at about its enlarged net
currentasset value

another example of this type is provided currently by standard
oil  of  california  a  concern  of  major  importance  in  early  1972  it
was selling at about the same price as 13 years before say 56 its
earnings had been remarkably steady with relatively small growth
but  with  only  one  small  decline  over  the  entire  period  its  book
value was about equal to the market price with this conservatively

portfolio policy for the enterprising investor the positive side

169

favorable  195871  record  the  company  has  never  shown  an  aver
age annual price as high as 15 times its current earnings in early
1972 the priceearnings ratio was only about 10

a third because for an unduly low price for a common stock may
be the markets failure to recognize its true earnings picture our
classic example here is northern pacific railway which in 194647
declined from 36 to 1312 the true earnings of the road in 1947 were
close  to  10  per  share  the  price  of  the  stock  was  held  down  in
great part by its 1 dividend it was neglected also because much of
its earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar
to railroads

the type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a
common stock that sells for less than the companys net working
capital  alone  after  deducting  all  prior  obligations  this  would
mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets
buildings machinery etc or any goodwill items that might exist
very  few  companies  turn  out  to  have  an  ultimate  value  less  than
the  working  capital  alone  although  scattered  instances  may  be
found the surprising thing rather is that there have been so many
enterprises  obtainable  which  have  been  valued  in  the  market  on
this bargain basis a compilation made in 1957 when the markets
level was by no means low disclosed about 150 of such common
stocks in table 74 we summarize the result of buying on decem
ber 31 1957 one share of each of the 85 companies in that list for
which  data  appeared  in  standard    poors  monthly  stock  guide
and holding them for two years

by something of a coincidence each of the groups advanced in
the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate
netcurrentasset  value  the  gain  for  the  entire  portfolio  in  that
period was 75 against 50 for standard  poors 425 industrials
what is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed signifi
cannot  losses  seven  held  about  even  and  78  showed  appreciable

diversified  basiswas  uniformly  good  for  many  years  prior  to
1957 it can probably be affirmed without hesitation that it consti
tutes  a  safe  and  profitable  method  of  determining  and  taking
advantage of undervalued situations however during the general
market  advance  after  1957  the  number  of  such  opportunities
became extremely limited and many of those available were show
ing  small  operating  profits  or  even  losses  the  market  decline  of
196970  produced  a  new  crop  of  these  subworkingcapital
stocks we discuss this group in chapter 15 on stock selection for
the enterprising investor

bargainissue  pattern  in  secondary  companies we  have
defined a secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly
important industry thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns
in its field but it may equally well be the chief unit in an unimpor
tant  line  by  way  of  exception  any  company  that  has  established
itself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered secondary

in the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction
was drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues pro
vided  the  latter  were  of  respectable  size  the  public  felt  that  a 
middlesized company was strong enough to weather storms and
that it had a better chance for really spectacular expansion than one
that  was  already  of  major  dimensions  the  depression  years
193132  however  had  a  particularly  devastating  impact  on  the
companies below the first rank either in size or in inherent stability
as a result of that experience investors have since developed a pro

nounced preference for industry leaders and a corresponding lack
of interest most of the time in the ordinary company of secondary
importance this has meant that the latter group have usually sold
at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have
the  former  it  has  meant  further  that  in  many  instances  the  price
has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class

when  investors  rejected  the  stocks  of  secondary  companies
even though these sold at relatively low prices they were express
ing  a  belief  or  fear  that  such  companies  faced  a  dismal  future  in
fact at least subconsciously they calculated that any price was too
high for them because they were heading for extinctionjust as in
1929 the companion theory for the blue chips was that no price
was too high for them because their future possibilities were limit
less both of these views were exaggerations and were productive
of  serious  investment  errors  actually  the  typical  middlesized
listed company is a large one when compared with the average pri
vately owned business there is no sound reason why such compa
nies should not continue indefinitely in operation undergoing the
vicissitudes  characteristic  of  our  economy  but  earning  on  the
whole a fair return on their invested capital

this  brief  review  indicates  that  the  stock  markets  attitude
toward  secondary  companies  tends  to  be  unrealistic  and  conse
quently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major
undervaluation  as  it  happens  the  world  war  ii  period  and  the
postwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to
the larger ones because then the normal competition for sales was
suspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins
more  spectacularly  thus  by  1946  the  markets  pattern  had  com
pletely reversed itself from that before the war whereas the lead
ing stocks in the dow jones industrial average had advanced only
40 from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high standard  poors index
of  lowpriced  stocks  had  shot  up  no  less  than  280  in  the  same
period  speculators  and  many  selfstyled  investorswith  the
proverbial  short  memories  of  people  in  the  stock  marketwere
eager to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at
inflated levels thus the pendulum had swung clear to the oppo
site extreme the very class of secondary issues that had formerly
supplied by far the largest proportion of bargain opportunities was
now  presenting  the  greatest  number  of  examples  of  overenthusi

172

the intelligent investor

asm  and  overvaluation  in  a  different  way  this  phenomenon  was
repeated  in  1961  and  1968the  emphasis  now  being  placed  on
new offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second
ary character and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields
such as electronics computers franchise concerns and oth
ers

as  was  to  be  expected  the  ensuing  market  declines  fell  most
heavily  on  these  overvaluations  in  some  cases  the  pendulum
swing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation

if most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued what
reason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit
uation  for  if  it  persists  indefinitely  will  he  not  always  be  in  the
same  market  position  as  when  he  bought  the  issue  the  answer
here  is  somewhat  complicated  substantial  profits  from  the  pur
chase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of
ways first the dividend return is relatively high second the rein
vested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will
ultimately  affect  the  price  in  a  five  to  sevenyear  period  these
advantages can bulk quite large in a wellselected list third a bull
market  is  ordinarily  most  generous  to  lowpriced  issues  thus  it
tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level
fourth even during relatively featureless market periods a contin
uous process of price adjustment goes on under which secondary
issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level
for  their  type  of  security  fifth  the  specific  factors  that  in  many

 from 1975 through 1983 small secondary stocks outperformed large
stocks  by  an  amazing  average  of  176  percentage  points  per  year  the
investing  public  eagerly  embraced  small  stocks  mutual  fund  companies
rolled  out  hundreds  of  new  funds  specializing  in  them  and  small  stocks
obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage points per year
over the next decade the cycle recurred in 1999 when small stocks beat
big stocks by nearly nine percentage points inspiring investment bankers to
sell  hundreds  of  hot  little  hightech  stocks  to  the  public  for  the  first  time
instead of electronics computers or franchise in their names the new
buzzwords were com optical wireless and even prefixes like e and

cases  made  for  a  disappointing  record  of  earnings  may  be  cor
rected  by  the  advent  of  new  conditions  or  the  adoption  of  new
policies or by a change in management

an important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition
of smaller companies by larger ones usually as part of a diversifi
cation  program  in  these  cases  the  consideration  paid  has  almost
always been relatively generous and much in excess of the bargain
levels existing not long before

when interest rates were much lower than in 1970 the field of
bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at
large discounts from the amount of their claim currently we have
a different situation in which even wellsecured issues sell at large
discounts  if  carrying  coupon  rates  of  say  412  or  less  example
american telephone  telegraph 258s due 1986 sold as low as 51
in 1970 deere  co 412s due 1983 sold as low as 62 these may
well  turn  out  to  have  been  bargain  opportunities  before  very
longif  ruling  interest  rates  should  decline  substantially  for  a
bargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall
have  to  turn  once  more  to  the  firstmortgage  bonds  of  railroads
now in financial difficulties which sell in the 20s or 30s such situa
tions are not for the inexpert investor lacking a real sense of values
in this area he may burn his fingers but there is an underlying ten
dency for market decline in this field to be overdone consequently
the  group  as  a  whole  offers  an  especially  rewarding  invitation  to
careful and courageous analysis in the decade ending in 1948 the
billiondollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer
ous and spectacular opportunities in this area such opportunities
have been quite scarce since then but they seem likely to return in
the 1970s

 defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today how
ever as already noted distressed and defaulted junk bonds as well as con
vertible  bonds  issued  by  hightech  companies  may  offer  real  value  in  the
wake  of  the  20002002  market  crash  but  diversification  in  this  area  is
essentialand  impractical  without  at  least  100000  to  dedicate  to  dis
tressed securities alone unless you are a millionaire several times over this
kind of diversification is not an option

special situations or workouts

not so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee
an attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in
it and this was true under almost any sort of general market situa
tion it was not actually forbidden territory to members of the gen
eral public some who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn
the  ropes  and  become  pretty  capable  practitioners  without  the
necessity  of  long  academic  study  or  apprenticeship  others  have
been  keen  enough  to  recognize  the  underlying  soundness  of  this
approach  and  to  attach  themselves  to  bright  young  men  who 
handled  funds  devoted  chiefly  to  these  special  situations  but 
in recent years for reasons we shall develop later the field of arbi
trages  and  workouts  became  riskier  and  less  profitable  it  may 
be that in years to come conditions in this field will become more
propitious  in  any  case  it  is  worthwhile  outlining  the  general
nature and origin of these operations with one or two illustrative
examples

the typical special situation has grown out of the increasing
number of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones as the gospel
of diversification of products has been adopted by more and more
managements  it  often  appears  good  business  for  such  an  enter
prise to acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter
rather than to start a new venture from scratch in order to make
such acquisition possible and to obtain acceptance of the deal by
the required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company
it  is  almost  always  necessary  to  offer  a  price  considerably  above 
the current level such corporate moves have been producing inter
esting  profitmaking  opportunities  for  those  who  have  made  a
study  of  this  field  and  have  good  judgment  fortified  by  ample
experience

a great  deal  of  money  was  made  by  shrewd  investors  not  so
many  years  ago  through  the  purchase  of  bonds  of  railroads  in
bankruptcybonds which they knew would be worth much more
than their cost when the railroads were finally reorganized after
promulgation of the plans of reorganization a when issued mar
ket for the new securities appeared these could almost always be
sold  for  considerably  more  than  the  cost  of  the  old  issues  which
were to be exchanged therefor there were risks of nonconsumma

175

tion  of  the  plans  or  of  unexpected  delays  but  on  the  whole  such
arbitrage operations proved highly profitable

there were similar opportunities growing out of the breakup of
publicutility  holding  companies  pursuant  to  1935  legislation
nearly all these enterprises proved to be worth considerably more
when  changed  from  holding  companies  to  a  group  of  separate
operating companies

the underlying factor here is the tendency of the security mar
kets to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of compli
cated legal proceedings an old wall street motto has been never
buy  into  a  lawsuit  this  may  be  sound  advice  to  the  speculator
seeking quick action on his holdings but the adoption of this atti
tude by the general public is bound to create bargain opportunities
in  the  securities  affected  by  it  since  the  prejudice  against  them
holds their prices down to unduly low levels

the  exploitation  of  special  situations  is  a  technical  branch  of
investment  which  requires  a  somewhat  unusual  mentality  and
equipment  probably  only  a  small  percentage  of  our  enterprising
investors are likely to engage in it and this book is not the appro
priate medium for expounding its complications6

broader implications of our rules for investment

investment policy as it has been developed here depends in the
first place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive pas
sive  or  aggressive  enterprising  role  the  aggressive  investor
must have a considerable knowledge of security valuesenough
in fact to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to
a  business  enterprise  there  is  no  room  in  this  philosophy  for  a

 a classic  recent  example  is  philip  morris  whose  stock  lost  23  in  two
days after a florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive damages of
up to 200 billion against the companywhich had finally admitted that cig
arettes may cause cancer within a year philip morriss stock had doubled
only  to  fall  back  after  a  later  multibilliondollar  judgment  in  illinois  several
other  stocks  have  been  virtually  destroyed  by  liability  lawsuits  including
johns manville w r grace and usg corp thus never buy into a law
suit remains a valid rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by

176

the intelligent investor

middle ground or a series of gradations between the passive and
aggressive  status  many  perhaps  most  investors  seek  to  place
themselves in such an intermediate category in our opinion that is
a compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than
achievement

as  an  investor  you  cannot  soundly  become  half  a  business
man expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business
profits on your funds

it follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own
ers should elect the defensive classification they do not have the
time  or  the  determination  or  the  mental  equipment  to  embark
upon investing as a quasibusiness they should therefore be satis
fied  with  the  excellent  return  now  obtainable  from  a  defensive
portfolio  and  with  even  less  and  they  should  stoutly  resist  the
recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other
paths

the enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu
rity  operation  for  which  his  training  and  judgment  are  adequate
and  which  appears  sufficiently  promising when  measured  by  estab
lished business standards

in our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors
we have attempted to apply such business standards in those for
the  defensive  investor  we  have  been  guided  largely  by  the  three
requirements of underlying safety simplicity of choice and prom
ise of satisfactory results in terms of psychology as well as arith
metic the use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field
of recommended investment a number of security classes that are
normally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors these
prohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p 30

let us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in
these  exclusions  we  have  advised  against  the  purchase  at  full
prices  of  three  important  categories  of  securities  1  foreign
bonds  2  ordinary  preferred  stocks  and  3  secondary  common
stocks  including  of  course  original  offerings  of  such  issues  by
full  prices  we  mean  prices  close  to  par  for  bonds  or  preferred
stocks  and  prices  that  represent  about  the  fair  business  value  of
the  enterprise  in  the  case  of  common  stocks  the  greater  number 
of  defensive  investors  are  to  avoid  these  categories  regardless  of
price  the  enterprising  investor  is  to  buy  them  only  when  obtain

portfolio policy for the enterprising investor the positive side

177

able  at  bargain  priceswhich  we  define  as  prices  not  more  than
twothirds of the appraisal value of the securities

what would happen if all investors were guided by our advice
in  these  matters  that  question  was  considered  in  regard  to  for
eign  bonds  on  p  138  and  we  have  nothing  to  add  at  this  point
investmentgrade preferred stocks would be bought solely by cor
porations such as insurance companies which would benefit from
the special incometax status of stock issues owned by them

the most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is
in  the  field  of  secondary  common  stocks  if  the  majority  of
investors being in the defensive class are not to buy them at all
the field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted further
more if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels
then  these  issues  would  be  doomed  to  sell  for  less  than  their  fair
value  except  to  the  extent  that  they  were  purchased  unintelli
gently

this may sound severe and even vaguely unethical yet in truth
we are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area
for the greater part of the past 40 years secondary issues for the
most  part  do fluctuate  about  a  central  level  which  is  well  below
their fair value they reach and even surpass that value at times
but this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets when the les
sons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of
paying the prevailing prices for common stocks

thus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog
nize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they
accept  the  central  market  levels  that  are  normal  for  that  class  as
their guide in fixing their own levels for purchase

there is a paradox here nevertheless the average wellselected
secondary  company  may  be  fully  as  promising  as  the  average
industrial leader what the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil
ity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth con
sequently  it  may  appear  illogical  to  many  readers  to  term
unintelligent the purchase of such secondary issues at their full
enterprise value we think that the strongest logic is that of expe
rience financial history says clearly that the investor may expect
satisfactory  results  on  the  average  from  secondary  common
stocks  only  if  he  buys  them  for  less  than  their  value  to  a  private
owner that is on a bargain basis

178

the intelligent investor

the last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi
nary outside investor  anyone  who  can  control a  secondary  com
pany or who is part of a cohesive group with such control is fully
justified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest
ing in a close corporation or other private business the distinc
tion  between  the  position  and  consequent  investment  policy  of
insiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise
itself becomes less important it is a basic characteristic of a primary
or  leading  company  that  a  single  detached  share  is  ordinarily
worth as much as a share in a controlling block in secondary com
panies the average market value of a detached share is substantially
less than its worth to a controlling owner because of this fact the
matter of shareholdermanagement relations and of those between
inside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important
and controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary
companies

at the end of chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak
ing any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary
companies  the  many  common  stocks  in  the  boundary  area  may
properly  exhibit  an  intermediate  price  behavior  it  would  not  be
illogical  for  an  investor  to  buy  such  an  issue  at  a  small discount
from its indicated or appraisal value on the theory that it is only a
small distance away from a primary classification and that it may
acquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future

thus  the  distinction  between  primary  and  secondary  issues
need not be made too precise for if it were then a small difference
in  quality  must  produce  a  large  differential  in  justified  purchase
price in saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas
sification of common stocks although we counseled against such a
middle ground in the classification of investors our reason for this
apparent  inconsistency  is  as  follows  no  great  harm  comes  from
some uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security because
such  cases  are  exceptional  and  not  a  great  deal  is  at  stake  in  the
matter  but  the  investors  choice  as  between  the  defensive  or  the
aggressive  status  is  of  major  consequence  to  him  and  he  should
not allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci
sion

in an ideal world the intelligent investor would hold stocks only when
they  are  cheap  and  sell  them  when  they  become  overpriced  then

like spacecraft that pick up speed as they rise into the earths strato
sphere growth stocks often seem to defy gravity let us look at the tra
jectories of three of the hottest growth stocks of the 1990s general
electric home depot and sun microsystems see figure 71

in every year from 1995 through 1999 each grew bigger and more
profitable revenues doubled at sun and more than doubled at home
depot according to value line ges revenues grew 29 its earnings
rose 65 at home depot and sun earnings per share roughly tripled
but something else was happeningand it would not have surprised
graham  one  bit  the  faster  these  companies  grew  the  more  expen
sive their stocks became and when stocks grow faster than compa
nies investors always end up sorry as figure 72 shows

a great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for

the stock

the more a stock has gone up the more it seems likely to keep going
up but that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental law
of financial physics the bigger they get the slower they grow a 1
billion company can double its sales fairly easily but where can a 50
billion company turn to find another 50 billion in business

growth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable
but when their priceearnings ratios go much above 25 or 30 the odds
get ugly





journalist carol loomis found that from 1960 through 1999 only
eight of the largest 150 companies on the fortune 500 list man

looking at five decades of data the research firm of sanford c

investors are not the only people who fall prey to the delusion that
hypergrowth can go on forever in february 2000 chief execu
tive john roth of nortel networks was asked how much bigger
his giant fiberoptics company could get the industry is grow
ing 14 to 15 a year roth replied and were going to grow
six points faster than that for a company our size that is pretty
heady stuff nortels stock up nearly 51 annually over the pre
vious six years was then trading at 87 times what wall street
was guessing it might earn in 2000 was the stock overpriced
its getting up there shrugged roth but there is still plenty of
room to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless strat
egy  after  all  he  added  cisco  systems  was  trading  at  121
times its projected earnings1

as  for  cisco  in  november  2000  its  chief  executive  john
chambers  insisted  that  his  company  could  keep  growing  at
least 50 annually logic he declared would indicate this is
a  breakaway  ciscos  stock  had  come  way  downit  was  then
trading at a mere 98 times its earnings over the previous year
and chambers urged investors to buy so who you going to bet
on he asked now may be the opportunity 2

instead  these  growth  companies  shrankand  their  over
priced stocks shriveled nortels revenues fell by 37 in 2001
and the company lost more than 26 billion that year ciscos
revenues did rise by 18 in 2001 but the company ended up
with  a  net  loss  of  more  than  1  billion  nortels  stock  at
11350  when  roth  spoke  finished  2002  at  165  ciscos
shares  at  52  when  chambers  called  his  company  a  break
away crumbled to 13

claimed  andrew  carnegie  a  century  ago  do  not  scatter  your  shot
   the great successes of life are made by concentration as gra
ham  points  out  the  really  big  fortunes  from  common  stocks  have
been made by people who packed all their money into one investment
they knew supremely well

nearly all the richest people in america trace their wealth to a con
centrated  investment  in  a  single  industry  or  even  a  single  company
think  bill  gates  and  microsoft  sam  walton  and  walmart  or  the
rockefellers  and  standard  oil  the  forbes 400  list  of  the  richest
americans for example has been dominated by undiversified fortunes
ever since it was first compiled in 1982

however almost no small fortunes have been made this wayand
not many big fortunes have been kept this way what carnegie neg
lected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great
failures of life look again at the forbes rich list back in 1982 the
average  net  worth  of  a  forbes 400  member  was  230  million  to
make  it  onto  the  2002  forbes 400  the  average  1982  member
needed  to  earn  only  a  45  average  annual  return  on  his  wealth
during a period when even bank accounts yielded far more than that
and the stock market gained an annual average of 132

so how many of the forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on
the  list  20  years  later  only  64  of  the  original  membersa  measly
16were still on the list in 2002 by keeping all their eggs in the one
basket  that  had  gotten  them  onto  the  list  in  the  first  placeonce
booming  industries  like  oil  and  gas  or  computer  hardware  or  basic
manufacturingall  the  other  original  members  fell  away  when  hard
times hit none of these peopledespite all the huge advantages that
great  wealth  can  bringwere  properly  prepared  they  could  only
stand by and wince at the sickening crunch as the constantly chang
ing economy crushed their only basket and all their eggs10

much of the work by hand

investing  in  foreign  stocks  may  not  be  mandatory  for  the  intelligent
investor  but  it  is  definitely  advisable  why  let us  try  a  little  thought

commentary on chapter 7

187

experiment its the end of 1989 and you are japanese here are the
facts



 over the past 10 years your stock market has gained an annual
average  of  212  well  ahead  of  the  175  annual  gains  in  the
united states
japanese  companies  are  buying  up  everything  in  the  united
states from the pebble beach golf course to rockefeller center
meanwhile  american  firms  like  drexel  burnham  lambert  finan
cial corp of america and texaco are going bankrupt
the us hightech industry is dying japans is booming



in 1989 in the land of the rising sun you can only conclude that
investing  outside  of  japan  is  the  dumbest  idea  since  sushi  vending
machines naturally you put all your money in japanese stocks

the  result  over  the  next  decade  you  lose  roughly  twothirds  of

your money

the lesson its not that you should never invest in foreign markets
like  japan  its  that  the  japanese  should  never  have  kept  all  their
money  at  home  and  neither  should  you  if  you  live  in  the  united
states work in the united states and get paid in us dollars you are
already making a multilayered bet on the us economy to be prudent
you  should  put  some  of  your  investment  portfolio  elsewheresimply
because no one anywhere can ever know what the future will bring at
home or abroad putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual
funds that hold foreign stocks including those in emerging markets
helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be
the best place in the world to invest

chapter 8

the investor and market fluctuations

to  the  extent  that  the  investors  funds  are  placed  in  highgrade
bonds of relatively short maturitysay of seven years or lesshe
will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and
need not take them into account this applies also to his holdings
of us savings bonds which he can always turn in at his cost price
or  more  his  longerterm  bonds  may  have  relatively  wide  price
swings  during  their  lifetimes  and  his  commonstock  portfolio  is
almost  certain  to  fluctuate  in  value  over  any  period  of  several
years

the investor should know about these possibilities and should
be prepared for them both financially and psychologically he will
want to benefit from changes in market levelscertainly through
an advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on and
perhaps  also  by  making  purchases  and  sales  at  advantageous
prices  this  interest  on  his  part  is  inevitable  and  legitimate
enough  but  it  involves  the  very  real  danger  that  it  will  lead  him
into speculative attitudes and activities it is easy for us to tell you
not  to  speculate  the  hard  thing  will  be  for  you  to  follow  this
advice  let  us  repeat  what  we  said  at  the  outset  if  you  want  to
speculate do so with your eyes open knowing that you will proba
bly lose money in the end be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program

we shall  deal  first  with  the  more  important  subject  of  price
changes  in  common  stocks  and  pass  later  to  the  area  of  bonds 
in chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock markets
action over the past hundred years in this section we shall return
to  that  material  from  time  to  time  in  order  to  see  what  the  past
record  promises  the  investorin  either  the  form  of  longterm

successive  rises  and  declines  or  in  the  possibilities  of  buying 
near  bearmarket  lows  and  selling  not  too  far  below  bullmarket
highs

market fluctuations as a guide to investment decisions

since common stocks even of investment grade are subject to
recurrent  and  wide  fluctuations  in  their  prices  the  intelligent
investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from
these  pendulum  swings  there  are  two  possible  ways  by  which 
he  may  try  to  do  this  the  way  of  timing and  the  way  of  pricing
by  timing  we  mean  the  endeavor  to  anticipate  the  action  of  the
stock  marketto  buy  or  hold  when  the  future  course  is  deemed 
to  be  upward  to  sell  or  refrain  from  buying  when  the  course 
is  downward  by  pricing  we  mean  the  endeavor  to  buy  stocks
when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when
they  rise  above  such  value  a less  ambitious  form  of  pricing  is 
the  simple  effort  to  make  sure  that  when  you  buy  you  do  not 
pay  too  much  for  your  stocks  this  may  suffice  for  the  defen
sive  investor  whose  emphasis  is  on  longpull  holding  but  as 
such  it  represents  an  essential  minimum  of  attention  to  market 
levels1

we are  convinced  that  the  intelligent  investor  can  derive  satis
factory results from pricing of either type we are equally sure that
if he places his emphasis on timing in the sense of forecasting he
will  end  up  as  a  speculator  and  with  a  speculators  financial
results  this  distinction  may  seem  rather  tenuous  to  the  layman
and  it  is  not  commonly  accepted  on  wall  street  as  a  matter  of
business  practice  or  perhaps  of  thoroughgoing  conviction  the
stock  brokers  and  the  investment  services  seem  wedded  to  the
principle  that  both  investors  and  speculators  in  common  stocks
should devote careful attention to market forecasts

the farther one gets from wall street the more skepticism one
will find we believe as to the pretensions of stockmarket forecast
ing or timing the investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer
able  predictions  which  appear  almost  daily  and  are  his  for  the
asking yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts
upon them why because he has been persuaded that it is impor
tant for him to form some opinion of the future course of the stock

190

the intelligent investor

market and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast
is at least more dependable than his own

we lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of mar
ket forecasting a great deal of brain power goes into this field and
undoubtedly some  people can  make  money  by  being  good  stock
market analysts but it is absurd to think that the general public can
ever make money out of market forecasts for who will buy when
the general public at a given signal rushes to sell out at a profit if
you the reader expect to get rich over the years by following some
system or leadership in market forecasting you must be expecting
to try to do what countless others are aiming at and to be able to
do it better than your numerous competitors in the market there
is  no  basis  either  in  logic  or  in  experience  for  assuming  that  any
typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more
successfully than the general public of which he is himself a part

there is one aspect of the timing philosophy which seems to
have  escaped  everyone is  notice  timing  is  of  great  psychological
importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in

 in the late 1990s the forecasts of market strategists became more influ
ential than ever before they did not unfortunately become more accurate
on march 10 2000 the very day that the nasdaq composite index hit its
alltime  high  of  504862  prudential  securitiess  chief  technical  analyst
ralph acampora said in usa today that he expected nasdaq to hit 6000
within 12 to 18 months five weeks later nasdaq had already shriveled to
332129but  thomas  galvin  a  market  strategist  at  donaldson  lufkin  
jenrette declared that there is only 200 or 300 points of downside for the
nasdaq and 2000 on the upside it turned out that there were no points
on  the  upside  and  more  than  2000  on  the  downside  as  nasdaq  kept
crashing until it finally scraped bottom on october 9 2002 at 111411 in
march 2001 abby joseph cohen chief investment strategist at goldman
sachs  co predicted that the standard  poors 500stock index would
close the year at 1650 and that the dow jones industrial average would
finish 2001 at 13000 we do not expect a recession said cohen and
believe  that  corporate  profits  are  likely  to  grow  at  close  to  trend  growth
rates later this year the us economy was sinking into recession even as
she spoke and the s  p 500 ended 2001 at 114808 while the dow fin
ished at 100215030 and 23 below her forecasts respectively

the investor and market fluctuations

191

a  hurry  the  idea  of  waiting  a  year  before  his  stock  moves  up  is
repugnant  to  him  but  a  waiting  period  as  such  is  of  no  conse
quence to the investor what advantage is there to him in having
his  money  uninvested  until  he  receives  some  presumably  trust
worthy signal that the time has come to buy he enjoys an advan
tage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently
lower price to offset his loss of dividend income what this means is
that  timing  is  of  no  real  value  to  the  investor  unless  it  coincides
with pricingthat is unless it enables him to repurchase his shares
at substantially under his previous selling price

in this respect the famous dow theory for timing purchases and
sales  has  had  an  unusual  history  briefly  this  technique  takes  its
signal  to  buy  from  a  special  kind  of  breakthrough  of  the  stock
averages on the up side and its selling signal from a similar break
through  on  the  down  side  the  calculatednot  necessarily
actualresults of using this method showed an almost unbroken
series of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s on the
basis  of  this  presentation  the  practical  value  of  the  dow  theory
would have appeared firmly established the doubt if any would
apply to the dependability of this published record as a picture
of what a dow theorist would actually have done in the market

a closer  study  of  the  figures  indicates  that  the  quality  of  the
results  shown  by  the  dow  theory  changed  radically  after  1938
a  few  years  after  the  theory  had  begun  to  be  taken  seriously  on
wall  street  its  spectacular  achievement  had  been  in  giving  a  sell
signal at 306 about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping
its  followers  out  of  the  long  bear  market  until  things  had  pretty
well righted themselves at 84 in 1933 but from 1938 on the dow
theory  operated  mainly  by  taking  its  practitioners  out  at  a  pretty
good price but then putting them back in again at a higher price
for  nearly  30  years  thereafter  one  would  have  done  appreciably
better by just buying and holding the djia2

in our view based on much study of this problem the change in
the dowtheory results is not accidental it demonstrates an inher
ent characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields
of  business  and  finance  those  formulas  that  gain  adherents  and

importance do so because they have worked well over a period or
sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the
statistical record of the past but as their acceptance increases their
reliability  tends  to  diminish  this  happens  for  two  reasons  first
the passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula
no  longer  fits  second  in  stockmarket  affairs  the  popularity  of  a
trading  theory  has  itself  an  influence  on  the  markets  behavior
which detracts in the long run from its profitmaking possibilities
the popularity of something like the dow theory may seem to cre
ate its own vindication since it would make the market advance or
decline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling
signal is given a stampede of this kind is of course much more
of a danger than an advantage to the public trader

buylowsellhigh approach

we are convinced that the average investor cannot deal success
fully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them can
he  benefit  from  them  after they  have  taken  placeie  by  buying
after each major decline and selling out after each major advance
the fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to
1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea in fact a classic
definition of a shrewd investor was one who bought in a bear
market when everyone else was selling and sold out in a bull mar
ket  when  everyone  else  was  buying  if  we  examine  our  chart  i
covering the fluctuations of the standard  poors composite index
between 1900 and 1970 and the supporting figures in table 31 p
66  we  can  readily  see  why  this  viewpoint  appeared  valid  until
fairly recent years

between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles
running  from  bearmarket  low  to  bullmarket  high  and  back  to
bearmarket low six of these took no longer than four years four
ran for six or seven years and onethe famous newera cycle of
19211932lasted  eleven  years  the  percentage  of  advance  from
the  lows  to  highs  ranged  from  44  to  500  with  most  between
about  50  and  100  the  percentage  of  subsequent  declines
ranged from 24 to 89 with most found between 40 and 50
it should be remembered that a decline of 50 fully offsets a pre
ceding advance of 100

nearly all the bull markets had a number of welldefined char
acteristics in common such as 1 a historically high price level 2
high priceearnings ratios 3 low dividend yields as against bond
yields 4 much speculation on margin and 5 many offerings of
new  commonstock  issues  of  poor  quality  thus  to  the  student  of
stockmarket  history  it  appeared  that  the  intelligent  investor
should have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar
kets to buy in the former and sell in the latter and to do so for the
most  part  at  reasonably  short  intervals  of  time  various  methods
were  developed  for  determining  buying  and  selling  levels  of  the
general market based on either value factors or percentage move
ments of prices or both

but we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull
market  that  began  in  1949  there  were  sufficient  variations  in  the
successive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the
desirable process of buying low and selling high the most notable
of these departures of course was the great bull market of the late
1920s which threw all calculations badly out of gear even in 1949
therefore  it  was  by  no  means  a  certainty  that  the  investor  could
base his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor
to buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in
bull markets

it  turned  out  in  the  sequel  that  the  opposite  was  true  the

 without bear markets to take stock prices back down anyone waiting to
buy  low  will  feel  completely  left  behindand  all  too  often  will  end  up
abandoning  any  former  caution  and  jumping  in  with  both  feet  that is  why
grahams  message  about  the  importance  of  emotional  discipline is  so
important  from  october  1990  through  january  2000  the  dow  jones
industrial  average  marched  relentlessly  upward  never  losing  more  than
20 and suffering a loss of 10 or more only three times the total gain
not counting dividends 3957 according to crandall pierce  co this
was the secondlongest uninterrupted bull market of the past century only
the  19491961  boom  lasted  longer  the  longer  a  bull  market  lasts  the
more severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia after five years or so
many  people  no  longer  believe  that  bear  markets  are  even  possible  all
those  who  forget  are  doomed  to  be  reminded  and  in  the  stock  market
recovered memories are always unpleasant

the intelligent investor

markets behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former
pattern  nor  obeyed  what  once  were  wellestablished  danger  sig
nals nor permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules
for  buying  low  and  selling  high  whether  the  old  fairly  regular
bullandbearmarket  pattern  will  eventually  return  we  do  not
know but it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to
base  his  present  policy  on  the  classic  formulaie  to  wait  for
demonstrable  bearmarket  levels  before  buying  any common
stocks  our  recommended  policy  has  however  made  provision 
for  changes  in  the  proportion of  common  stocks  to  bonds  in  the
portfolio  if  the  investor  chooses  to  do  so  according  as  the  level 
of  stock  prices  appears  less  or  more  attractive  by  value  stan

formula plans

in the early years of the stockmarket rise that began in 194950
considerable  interest  was  attracted  to  various  methods  of  taking
advantage of the stock markets cycles these have been known as
formula investment plans the essence of all such plansexcept
the simple case of dollar averagingis that the investor automati
cally  does  some selling  of  common  stocks  when  the  market
advances  substantially  in  many  of  them  a  very  large  rise  in  the
market level would result in the sale of all commonstock holdings
others  provided  for  retention  of  a  minor  proportion  of  equities
under all circumstances

this approach had the double appeal of sounding logical and
conservative and of showing excellent results when applied retro
spectively to the stock market over many years in the past unfor
tunately  its  vogue  grew  greatest  at  the  very  time  when  it  was
destined to work least well many of the formula planners found
themselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level
in the middle 1950s true they had realized excellent profits but in
a  broad  sense  the  market  ran  away  from  them  thereafter  and

 graham discusses this recommended policy in chapter 4 pp 8991
this policy now called tactical asset allocation is widely followed by insti
tutional investors like pension funds and university endowments

their formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common
stock position

there  is  a  similarity  between  the  experience  of  those  adopting
the formulainvesting approach in the early 1950s and those who
embraced the purely mechanical version of the dow theory some
20  years  earlier  in  both  cases  the  advent  of  popularity  marked
almost the exact moment when the system ceased to work well we
have  had  a  like  discomfiting  experience  with  our  own  central
value method of determining indicated buying and selling levels
of  the  dow  jones  industrial average  the  moral  seems  to  be  that
any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be
easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too
simple and too easy to last spinozas concluding remark applies
to wall street as well as to philosophy all things excellent are as
difficult as they are rare

market fluctuations of the investors portfolio

every  investor  who  owns  common  stocks  must  expect  to  see
them  fluctuate  in  value  over  the  years  the  behavior  of  the  djia
since our last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty
well  what  has  happened  to  the  stock  portfolio  of  a  conservative
investor  who  limited  his  stock  holdings  to  those  of  large  promi
nent and conservatively financed corporations the overall value
advanced  from  an  average  level  of  about  890  to  a  high  of  995  in

 many of these formula planners would have sold all their stocks at the
end of 1954 after the us stock market rose 526 the secondhighest
yearly return then on record over the next five years these markettimers
would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks doubled
 easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons the
natural  tendency  of  trends  to  reverse  over  time  or  regress  to  the  mean
and  the  rapid  adoption  of  the  stockpicking  scheme  by  large  numbers  of
people who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got there first note
that  in  referring  to  his  discomfiting  experience  graham  isas  always
honest  in  admitting  his  own  failures  see  jason  zweig  murphy  was  an

1966  and  985  again  in  1968  fell  to  631  in  1970  and  made  an
almost  full  recovery  to  940  in  early  1971  since  the  individual
issues  set  their  high  and  low  marks  at  different  times  the  fluc
tuations  in  the  dow  jones  group  as  a  whole  are  less  severe  than
those  in  the  separate  components  we  have  traced  through  the
price  fluctuations  of  other  types  of  diversified  and  conservative 
commonstock  portfolios  and  we  find  that  the  overall  results  are
not likely to be markedly different from the above in general the
shares  of  secondline  companies   fluctuate  more  widely  than  the
major ones but this does not necessarily mean that a group of well
established  but  smaller  companies  will  make  a  poorer  showing
over  a  fairly  long  period  in  any  case  the  investor  may  as  well
resign  himself  in  advance  to  the  probability  rather  than  the  mere
possibility that most of his holdings will advance say 50 or more
from their low point and decline the equivalent onethird or more
from their high point at various periods in the next five years

a serious investor is not likely to believe that the daytoday or
even  monthtomonth  fluctuations  of  the  stock  market  make  him
richer  or  poorer  but  what  about  the  longerterm  and  wider
changes here practical questions present themselves and the psy
chological problems are likely to grow complicated a substantial
rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and
a because for prudent concern but it may also bring a strong tempta
tion  toward  imprudent  action your  shares  have  advanced  good

 todays equivalent of what graham calls secondline companies would
be  any  of  the  thousands  of  stocks  not  included  in  the  standard    poors
500stock index a regularly revised list of the 500 stocks in the s  p index
is available at wwwstandardandpoorscom
 note carefully what graham is saying here it is not just possible but prob
able that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50 from their low
est price and lose at least 33 from their highest priceregardless of which
stocks you own or whether the market as a whole goes up or down if you
cannot live with thator you think your portfolio is somehow magically exempt
from  itthen  you  are  not  yet  entitled  to  call  yourself  an  investor  graham
refers to a 33 decline as the equivalent onethird because a 50 gain
takes a 10 stock to 15 from 15 a 33 loss or 5 drop takes it right
back to 10 where it started

you are richer than you were good but has the price risen too high
and should you think of selling or should you kick yourself for
not  having  bought  more  shares  when  the  level  was  lower  or
worst thought of allshould you now give way to the bullmarket
atmosphere  become  infected  with  the  enthusiasm  the  overconfi
dence and the greed of the great public of which after all you are
a part and make larger and dangerous commitments presented
thus in print the answer to the last question is a selfevident no but
even  the  intelligent  investor  is  likely  to  need  considerable  will
power to keep from following the crowd

it is for these reasons of human nature even more than by calcu
lation of financial gain or loss that we favor some kind of mechan
ical  method  for  varying  the  proportion  of  bonds  to  stocks  in  the
investors  portfolio  the  chief  advantage  perhaps  is  that  such  a
formula will give him something to do as the market advances he
will from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings putting
the  proceeds  into  bonds  as  it  declines  he  will  reverse  the  proce
dure  these  activities  will  provide  some  outlet  for  his  otherwise
toopentup energies if he is the right kind of investor he will take
added satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly
opposite from those of the crowd

business valuations versus stockmarket valuations

the impact of market fluctuations upon the investors true situ
ation  may  be  considered  also  from  the  standpoint  of  the  share
holder  as  the  part  owner  of  various  businesses  the  holder  of
marketable  shares  actually  has  a  double  status  and  with  it  the
privilege  of  taking  advantage  of  either  at  his  choice  on  the  one
hand his position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or
silent  partner  in  a  private  business  here  his  results  are  entirely
dependent  on  the  profits  of  the  enterprise  or  on  a  change  in  the
underlying  value  of  its  assets  he  would  usually  determine  the
value of such a privatebusiness interest by calculating his share of
the  net  worth  as  shown  in  the  most  recent  balance  sheet  on  the

 for todays investor the ideal strategy for pursuing this formula is rebal
ancing which we discuss on pp 104105

other hand the commonstock investor holds a piece of paper an
engraved stock certificate which can be sold in a matter of minutes
at a price which varies from moment to momentwhen the mar
ket  is  open  that  isand  often  is  far  removed  from  the  balance
sheet value

the  development  of  the  stock  market  in  recent  decades  has
made  the  typical  investor  more  dependent  on  the  course  of  price
quotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a
business  owner  the  reason  is  that  the  successful  enterprises  in
which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly
at  prices  well  above  their  net  asset  value  or  book  value  or 
balancesheet  value  in  paying  these  market  premiums  the
investor gives precious hostages to fortune for he must depend on
the stock market itself to validate his commitments

this  is  a  factor  of  prime  importance  in  presentday  investing
and it has received less attention than it deserves the whole struc
ture  of  stockmarket  quotations  contains  a  builtin  contradiction
the better a companys record and prospects the less relationship
the price of its shares will have to their book value but the greater
the premium above book value the less certain the basis of deter
mining its intrinsic valueie the more this value will depend
on  the  changing  moods  and  measurements  of  the  stock  market
thus we reach the final paradox that the more successful the com
pany the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its
shares  this  really  means  that  in  a  very  real  sense  the  better  the

 most companies today provide an engraved stock certificate only upon
special  request  stocks  exist  for  the  most  part  in  purely  electronic  form
much as your bank account contains computerized credits and debits not

in grahams day
 net asset value book value balancesheet value and tangibleasset value
are  all  synonyms  for  net  worth  or  the  total  value  of  a  companys  physical
and financial assets minus all its liabilities it can be calculated using the bal
ance sheets in a companys annual and quarterly reports from total share
holders equity subtract all soft assets such as goodwill trademarks and
other intangibles divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to

quality of a common stock the more speculative it is likely to beat
least  as  compared  with  the  unspectacular  middlegrade  issues
what we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth
companies with the bulk of wellestablished concerns we exclude
from  our  purview  here  those  issues  which  are  highly  speculative
because the businesses themselves are speculative

the argument made above should explain the often erratic price
behavior  of  our  most  successful  and  impressive  enterprises  our
favorite  example  is  the  monarch  of  them  allinternational  busi
ness machines the price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven
months in 196263 after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in
1970  similarly  xeroxan  even  more  impressive  earnings  gainer
in recent decadesfell from 171 to 87 in 196263 and from 116 to
65 in 1970 these striking losses did not indicate any doubt about
the future longterm growth of ibm or xerox they reflected instead
a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock mar
ket itself had placed on these excellent prospects

the  previous  discussion  leads  us  to  a  conclusion  of  practical
importance to the conservative investor in common stocks if he is
to  pay  some  special  attention  to  the  selection  of  his  portfolio  it
might be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reason
ably close approximation to their tangibleasset valuesay at not
more  than  onethird  above  that  figure  purchases  made  at  such 
levels  or  lower  may  with  logic  be  regarded  as  related  to  the

 grahams  use  of  the  word  paradox  is  probably  an  allusion  to  a  classic
article by david durand growth stocks and the petersburg paradox the
journal  of  finance vol xii no 3 september 1957 pp 348363 which
compares  investing  in  highpriced  growth  stocks  to  betting  on  a  series  of
coin  flips  in  which  the  payoff  escalates  with  each  flip  of  the  coin  durand
points out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for 
an indefinite period of time an investor should in theory be willing to pay
an  infinite  price  for  its  shares  why  then  has  no  stock  ever  sold  for  a 
price of infinity dollars per share because the higher the assumed future
growth  rate  and  the  longer  the  time  period  over  which  it  is  expected  the
wider the margin for error grows and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis
calculation becomes graham discusses this problem further in appendix 4

companys balance sheet and as having a justification or support
independent  of  the  fluctuating  market  prices  the  premium  over
book  value  that  may  be  involved  can  be  considered  as  a  kind  of
extra fee paid for the advantage of stockexchange listing and the
marketability that goes with it

a caution  is  needed  here  a stock  does  not  become  a  sound
investment  merely  because  it  can  be  bought  at  close  to  its  asset
value the investor should demand in addition a satisfactory ratio
of earnings to price a sufficiently strong financial position and the
prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years
this  may  appear  like  demanding  a  lot  from  a  modestly  priced
stock but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger
ously high market conditions once the investor is willing to forgo
brilliant prospectsie better than average expected growthhe
will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting
these criteria

in our chapters on the selection of common stocks chapters 14
and 15 we shall give data showing that more than half of the djia
issues  met  our  assetvalue  criterion  at  the  end  of  1970  the  most
widely held investment of allamerican tel  telactually sells
below  its  tangibleasset  value  as  we  write  most  of  the  lightand
power shares in addition to their other advantages are now early
1972 available at prices reasonably close to their asset values

the  investor  with  a  stock  portfolio  having  such  book  values
behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of
stockmarket fluctuations than those who have paid high multipli
ers  of  both  earnings  and  tangible  assets  as  long  as  the  earning
power  of  his  holdings  remains  satisfactory  he  can  give  as  little
attention  as  he  pleases  to  the  vagaries  of  the  stock  market  more
than  that  at  times  he  can  use  these  vagaries  to  play  the  master
game of buying low and selling high

the a  p example

at  this  point  we  shall  introduce  one  of  our  original  examples
which dates back many years but which has a certain fascination
for  us  because  it  combines  so  many  aspects  of  corporate  and
investment experience it involves the great atlantic  pacific tea
co here is the story

the investor and market fluctuations

201

a  p shares were introduced to trading on the curb market
now the american stock exchange in 1929 and sold as high as 494
by 1932 they had declined to 104 although the companys earnings
were  nearly  as  large  in  that  generally  catastrophic  year  as  previ
ously in 1936 the range was between 111 and 131 then in the busi
ness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low
of 36

that  price  was  extraordinary  it  meant  that  the  preferred  and
common were together selling for 126 million although the com
pany had just reported that it held 85 million in cash alone and a
working capital or net current assets of 134 million a  p was
the largest retail enterprise in america if not in the world with a
continuous  and  impressive  record  of  large  earnings  for  many
years  yet  in  1938  this  outstanding  business  was  considered  on
wall  street  to  be  worth  less  than  its  current  assets  alonewhich
means  less  as  a  going  concern  than  if  it  were  liquidated  why
first  because  there  were  threats  of  special  taxes  on  chain  stores
second because net profits had fallen off in the previous year and
third because the general market was depressed the first of these
reasons  was  an  exaggerated  and  eventually  groundless  fear  the
other two were typical of temporary influences

let us assume that the investor had bought a  p common in
1937 at say 12 times its fiveyear average earnings or about 80 we
are  far  from  asserting  that  the  ensuing  decline  to  36  was  of  no
importance to him he would have been well advised to scrutinize
the picture with some care to see whether he had made any mis
calculations  but  if  the  results  of  his  study  were  reassuringas
they should have beenhe was entitled then to disregard the mar
ket  decline  as  a  temporary  vagary  of  finance  unless  he  had  the
funds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on
the bargain basis offered

sequel and reflections

the  following  year  1939  a    p  shares  advanced  to  11712  or
three  times  the  low  price  of  1938  and  well  above  the  average  of
1937 such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no
means uncommon but in the case of a  p it was more striking
than  most  in  the  years  after  1949  the  grocery  chains  shares  rose

with the general market until in 1961 the splitup stock 10 for 1
reached  a  high  of  7012 which  was  equivalent  to  705  for  the  1938
shares

this price of 7012 was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the
earnings  of  1961  such  a  priceearnings  ratiowhich  compares
with 23 times for the djia in that yearmust have implied expec
tations of a brilliant growth in earnings this optimism had no jus
tification in the companys earnings record in the preceding years
and it proved completely wrong instead of advancing rapidly the
course of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward
the year after the 7012 high the price fell by more than half to 34
but this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they
showed at the low quotation in 1938 after varying sorts of fluctua
tions the price fell to another low of 2112 in 1970 and 18 in 1972
having reported the first quarterly deficit in its history

we see  in  this  history  how  wide  can  be  the  vicissitudes  of  a
major american enterprise in little more than a single generation
and also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and
pessimism  the  public  has  valued  its  shares  in  1938  the  business
was really being given away with no takers in 1961 the public was
clamoring  for  the  shares  at  a  ridiculously  high  price  after  that
came a quick loss of half the market value and some years later a
substantial  further  decline  in  the  meantime  the  company  was  to
turn  from  an  outstanding  to  a  mediocre  earnings  performer  its
profit in the boomyear 1968 was to be less than in 1958 it had paid
a  series  of  confusing  small  stock  dividends  not  warranted  by  the
current additions to surplus and so forth a  p was a larger com
pany  in  1961  and  1972  than  in  1938  but  not  as  wellrun  not  as
profitable and not as attractive

there are two chief morals to this story the first is that the stock
market  often  goes  far  wrong  and  sometimes  an  alert  and  coura

 the  more  recent  history  of  a    p  is  no  different  at  yearend  1999  its
share price was 27875 at yearend 2000 700 a year later 2378 at
yearend 2002 806 although some accounting irregularities later came
to light at a  p it defies all logic to believe that the value of a relatively sta
ble business like groceries could fall by threefourths in one year triple the
next year then drop by twothirds the year after that

geous investor can take advantage of its patent errors the other is
that  most  businesses  change  in  character  and  quality  over  the
years sometimes for the better perhaps more often for the worse
the  investor  need  not  watch  his  companies  performance  like  a
hawk but he should give it a good hard look from time to time

let  us  return  to  our  comparison  between  the  holder  of  mar
ketable shares and the man with an interest in a private business
we have said that the former has the option of considering himself
merely as the part owner of the various businesses he has invested
in  or  as  the  holder  of  shares  which  are  salable  at  any  time  he
wishes at their quoted market price

but  note  this  important  fact  the  true  investor  scarcely  ever  is
forced to sell his shares and at all other times he is free to disregard
the  current  price  quotation  he  need  pay  attention  to  it  and  act
upon it only to the extent that it suits his book and no more thus
the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor
ried  by  unjustified  market  declines  in  his  holdings  is  perversely
transforming  his  basic  advantage  into  a  basic  disadvantage  that
man  would  be  better  off  if  his  stocks  had  no  market  quotation  at
all for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by
other persons mistakes of judgment

incidentally a widespread situation of this kind actually existed
during  the  dark  depression  days  of  19311933  there  was  then  a
psychological advantage in owning business interests that had no
quoted  market  for  example  people  who  owned  first  mortgages
on real estate that continued to pay interest were able to tell them
selves that their investments had kept their full value there being
no  market  quotations  to  indicate  otherwise  on  the  other  hand
many  listed  corporation  bonds  of  even  better  quality  and  greater

 only to the extent that it suits his book means only to the extent that the
price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock in traditional brokerage
lingo the book is an investors ledger of holdings and trades
 this may well be the single most important paragraph in grahams entire
book in these 113 words graham sums up his lifetime of experience you
cannot read these words too often they are like kryptonite for bear markets
if  you  keep  them  close  at  hand  and  let  them  guide  you  throughout  your
investing life you will survive whatever the markets throw at you

underlying  strength  suffered  severe  shrinkages  in  their  market
quotations  thus  making  their  owners  believe  they  were  growing
distinctly  poorer  in  reality  the  owners  were  better  off  with  the
listed  securities  despite  the  low  prices  of  these  for  if  they  had
wanted to or were compelled to they could at least have sold the
issuespossibly  to  exchange  them  for  even  better  bargains  or
they  could  just  as  logically  have  ignored  the  markets  action  as
temporary and basically meaningless but it is selfdeception to tell
yourself  that  you  have  suffered  no  shrinkage  in  value  merely
because your securities have no quoted market at all

returning to our a  p shareholder in 1938 we assert that as
long as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price
decline  beyond  what  his  own  judgment  may  have  told  him  was
occasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value if
no  such  shrinkage  had  occurred  he  had  a  right  to  expect  that  in
due course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or
betteras in fact it did the following year in this respect his posi
tion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private
business with no quoted market for its shares for in that case too
he might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off
part  of  the  cost  of  his  holdings  because  of  the  impact  of  the  1938
recessiondepending on what had happened to his company

critics  of  the  value  approach  to  stock  investment  argue  that
listed common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in
the same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise because
the  presence  of  an  organized  security  market  injects  into  equity
ownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity
but what this liquidity really means is first that the investor has
the  benefit  of  the  stock  markets  daily  and  changing  appraisal  of
his  holdings  for  whatever  that  appraisal  may  be  worth and  second
that  the  investor  is  able  to  increase  or  decrease  his  investment  at
the  markets  daily  figureif  he  chooses thus  the  existence  of  a
quoted  market  gives  the  investor  certain  options that  he  does  not
have if his security is unquoted but it does not impose the current
quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from
some other source

let us close this section with something in the nature of a para
ble imagine that in some private business you own a small share
that cost you 1000 one of your partners named mr market is

the investor and market fluctuations

205

very obliging indeed every day he tells you what he thinks your
interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to
sell you an additional interest on that basis sometimes his idea of
value  appears  plausible  and  justified  by  business  developments
and  prospects  as  you  know  them  often  on  the  other  hand  mr
market let us his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him and the
value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly

if you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman will you
let mr markets daily communication determine your view of the
value of a 1000 interest in the enterprise only in case you agree
with him or in case you want to trade with him you may be happy
to  sell  out  to  him  when  he  quotes  you  a  ridiculously  high  price
and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low but the
rest  of  the  time  you  will  be  wiser  to  form  your  own  ideas  of  the
value  of  your  holdings  based  on  full  reports  from  the  company
about its operations and financial position

the true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed
common stock he can take advantage of the daily market price or
leave it alone as dictated by his own judgment and inclination he
must take cognizance of important price movements for otherwise
his judgment will have nothing to work on conceivably they may
give him a warning signal which he will do well to heedthis in
plain english means that he is to sell his shares because the price has
gone down foreboding worse things to come in our view such sig
nals are misleading at least as often as they are helpful basically
price  fluctuations  have  only  one  significant  meaning  for  the  true
investor  they  provide  him  with  an  opportunity  to  buy  wisely
when  prices  fall  sharply  and  to  sell  wisely  when  they  advance  a
great deal at other times he will do better if he forgets about the
stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the
operating results of his companies

summary

the most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec
ulator is found in their attitude toward stockmarket movements
the speculators primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting
from  market  fluctuations  the  investors  primary  interest  lies  in
acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices market

206

the intelligent investor

movements are important to him in a practical sense because they
alternately  create  low  price  levels  at  which  he  would  be  wise  to
buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from
buying and probably would be wise to sell

it  is  far  from  certain  that  the  typical  investor  should  regularly
hold off buying until low market levels appear because this may
involve a long wait very likely the loss of income and the possible
missing of investment opportunities on the whole it may be better
for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to
put in stocks except when the general market level is much higher
than can be justified by wellestablished standards of value if he
wants to be shrewd he can look for the everpresent bargain oppor
tunities in individual securities

aside  from  forecasting  the  movements  of  the  general  market
much effort and ability are directed on wall street toward selecting
stocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will do better
than the rest over a fairly short period in the future logical as this
endeavor may seem we do not believe it is suited to the needs or
temperament of the true investorparticularly since he would be
competing with a large number of stockmarket traders and first
class  financial  analysts  who  are  trying  to  do  the  same  thing  as 
in  all  other  activities  that  emphasize  price  movements  first  and
underlying values second the work of many intelligent minds con
stantly engaged in this field tends to be selfneutralizing and self
defeating over the years

the investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their
prices  to  fluctuate  and  should  neither  be  concerned  by  sizable
declines  nor  become  excited  by  sizable  advances  he  should
always  remember  that  market  quotations  are  there  for  his  conve
nience either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored he should
never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has
gone  down  he  would  not  be  far  wrong  if  this  motto  read  more
simply never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or
sell one immediately after a substantial drop

an added consideration

something should be said about the significance of average mar
ket prices as a measure of managerial competence the shareholder

207

judges  whether  his  own  investment  has  been  successful  in  terms
both of dividends received and of the longrange trend of the aver
age market value the same criteria should logically be applied in
testing  the  effectiveness  of  a  companys  management  and  the
soundness of its attitude toward the owners of the business

this  statement  may  sound  like  a  truism  but  it  needs  to  be
emphasized for as yet there is no accepted technique or approach
by which management is brought to the bar of market opinion on
the contrary managements have always insisted that they have no
responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of
their shares it is true of course that they are not accountable for
those fluctuations in price which as we have been insisting bear no
relationship to underlying conditions and values but it is only the
lack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of share
holders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of
market  quotations  including  the  permanent  establishment  of  a
depreciated  and  unsatisfactory  price  level  good  managements
produce a good average market price and bad managements pro
duce bad market prices

fluctuations in bond prices

the investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin
cipal  and  interest  may  be  unquestioned  a  longterm  bond  could
vary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates
in table 81 we give data for various years back to 1902 covering
yields for highgrade corporate and taxfree issues as individual
illustrations  we  add  the  price  fluctuations  of  two  representative
railroad issues for a similar period these are the atchison topeka
 santa fe general mortgage 4s due 1995 for generations one of
our premier noncallable bond issues and the northern pacific ry
3s due 2047originally a 150year maturitylong a typical baa
rated bond

because of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond
to  the  high  prices  and  vice  versa  the  decline  in  the  northern

 graham has much more to say on what is now known as corporate gov
ernance see the commentary on chapter 19

208

the intelligent investor

pacific 3s in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the
issue it is extraordinary that the price recovered to an alltime high
in the next few years and then lost twothirds of its price chiefly
because of the rise in general interest rates there have been star
tling  variations  as  well  in  the  price  of  even  the  highestgrade
bonds in the past forty years

note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same inverse pro
portion as the calculated yields because their fixed maturity value
of  100  exerts  a  moderating  influence  however  for  very  long
maturities  as  in  our  northern  pacific  example  prices  and  yields
change at close to the same rate

since 1964 record movements in both directions have taken place
in  the  highgrade  bond  market  taking  prime  municipals  tax
free  as  an  example  their  yield  more  than  doubled  from  32  in
january 1965 to 7 in june 1970 their price index declined corre
spondingly  from  1108  to  675  in  mid1970  the  yields  on  high
grade  longterm  bonds  were  higher  than  at  any  time  in  the  nearly
200 years of this countrys economic history twentyfive years earlier
just before our protracted bull market began bond yields were at
their lowest point in history longterm municipals returned as little
as 1 and industrials gave 240 compared with the 412 to 5 for
merly considered normal those of us with a long experience on
wall street had seen newtons law of action and reaction equal
and opposite work itself out repeatedly in the stock marketthe
most  noteworthy  example  being  the  rise  in  the  djia from  64  in
1921 to 381 in 1929 followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932 but
this  time  the  widest  pendulum  swings  took  place  in  the  usually
staid and slowmoving array of highgrade bond prices and yields
moral  nothing  important  on  wall  street  can  be  counted  on  to
occur  exactly  in  the  same  way  as  it  happened  before  this  repre

 by what graham called the rule of opposites in 2002 the yields on long
term  us  treasury  bonds  hit  their  lowest levels  since  1963  since  bond
yields  move  inversely  to  prices  those  low  yields  meant  that  prices  had
risenmaking investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most
expensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low this
provides another proof of grahams lesson that the intelligent investor must
refuse to make decisions based on market fluctuations

the intelligent investor

sents the first half of our favorite dictum the more it changes the
more its the same thing

if  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  make  worthwhile  predictions
about the price movements of stocks it is completely impossible to
do  so  for  bonds  in  the  old  days  at  least  one  could  often  find  a
useful clue to the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying
the prior action of bonds but no similar clues were given to a com
ing  change  in  interest  rates  and  bond  prices  hence  the  investor
must choose between longterm and shortterm bond investments
on  the  basis  chiefly  of  his  personal  preferences  if  he  wants  to  be
certain that the market values will not decrease his best choices are
probably us savings bonds series e or h which were described
above  p  93  either  issue  will  give  him  a  5  yield  after  the  first
year  the  series  e  for  up  to  556 years  the  series  h  for  up  to  ten
years with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better

if the investor wants the 75 now available on good longterm
corporate  bonds  or  the  53  on  taxfree  municipals  he  must  be
prepared to see them fluctuate in price banks and insurance com
panies have the privilege of valuing highrated bonds of this type
on  the  mathematical  basis  of  amortized  cost  which  disregards
market  prices  it  would  not  be  a  bad  idea  for  the  individual
investor to do something similar

the price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks
are  the  resultant  of  three  different  factors  1  variations  in  the 
price  of  the  related  common  stock  2  variations  in  the  credit
standing  of  the  company  and  3  variations  in  general  interest
rates  a good  many  of  the  convertible  issues  have  been  sold  by
companies  that  have  credit  ratings  well  below  the  best3 some  of
these  were  badly  affected  by  the  financial  squeeze  in  1970  as  a
result convertible issues as a whole have been subjected to triply
unsettling  influences  in  recent  years  and  price  variations  have
been  unusually  wide  in  the  typical  case  therefore  the  investor
would  delude  himself  if  he  expected  to  find  in  convertible  issues
that ideal combination of the safety of a highgrade bond and price

 an updated analysis for todays readers explaining recent yields and the
wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today can be found in the
commentary on chapter 4

protection plus a chance to benefit from an advance in the price of
the common

this may be a good place to make a suggestion about the long
term bond of the future why should not the effects of changing
interest  rates  be  divided  on  some  practical  and  equitable  basis
between the borrower and the lender one possibility would be to
sell  longterm  bonds  with  interest  payments  that  vary  with  an
appropriate  index  of  the  going  rate  the  main  results  of  such  an
arrangement would be 1 the investors bond would always have
a principal value of about 100 if the company maintains its credit
rating but the interest received will vary say with the rate offered
on  conventional  new  issues  2  the  corporation  would  have  the
advantages of longterm debtbeing spared problems and costs of
frequent  renewals  of  refinancingbut  its  interest  costs  would
change from year to year4

over the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by
an increasingly serious dilemma shall he choose complete stability
of principal value but with varying and usually low shortterm
interest  rates  or  shall  he  choose  a  fixedinterest  income  with 
considerable variations usually downward it seems in his princi
pal  value  it  would  be  good  for  most  investors  if  they  could 
compromise  between  these  extremes  and  be  assured  that  neither
their  interest  return  nor  their  principal  value  will  fall  below  a
stated  minimum  over  say  a  20year  period  this  could  be
arranged without great difficulty in an appropriate bond contract
of a new form important note in effect the us government has
done  a  similar  thing  in  its  combination  of  the  original  savings
bonds contracts with their extensions at higher interest rates the
suggestion  we  make  here  would  cover  a  longer  fixed  investment
period than the savings bonds and would introduce more flexibil
ity in the interestrate provisions

it  is  hardly  worthwhile  to  talk  about  nonconvertible  preferred
stocks since their special tax status makes the safe ones much more
desirable  holdings  by  corporationseg  insurance  companies

 as mentioned in the commentary on chapters 2 and 4 treasury inflation
protected securities or tips are a new and improved version of what gra
ham is suggesting here

than by individuals the poorerquality ones almost always fluctu
ate  over  a  wide  range  percentagewise  not  too  differently  from
common stocks we can offer no other useful remark about them
table  162  below  p  406  gives  some  information  on  the  price
changes of lowergrade nonconvertible preferreds between decem
ber 1968 and december 1970 the average decline was 17 against
113 for the s  p composite index of common stocks

most of the time the market is mostly accurate in pricing most stocks
millions  of  buyers  and  sellers  haggling  over  price  do  a  remarkably
good job of valuing companieson average but sometimes the price
is not right occasionally it is very wrong indeed and at such times
you  need  to  understand  grahams  image  of  mr  market  probably 
the  most  brilliant  metaphor  ever  created  for  explaining  how  stocks 
can  become  mispriced1 the  manicdepressive  mr  market  does  not
always  price  stocks  the  way  an  appraiser  or  a  private  buyer  would
value a business instead when stocks are going up he happily pays
more than their objective value and when they are going down he is
desperate to dump them for less than their true worth

is mr market still around is he still bipolar you bet he is
on march 17 2000 the stock of inktomi corp hit a new high of
231625 since they first came on the market in june 1998 shares 
in  the  internetsearching  software  company  had  gained  roughly
1900 just in the few weeks since december 1999 the stock had
nearly tripled

what was going on at inktomi the business that could make inktomi
the stock so valuable the answer seems obvious phenomenally fast

growth in the three months ending in december 1999 inktomi sold
36  million  in  products  and  services  more  than  it  had  in  the  entire
year  ending  in  december  1998  if  inktomi  could  sustain  its  growth
rate of the previous 12 months for just five more years its revenues
would explode from 36 million a quarter to 5 billion a month with
such  growth  in  sight  the  faster  the  stock  went  up  the  farther  up  it
seemed certain to go

but in his wild love affair with inktomis stock mr market was over
looking  something  about  its  business  the  company  was  losing
moneylots of it it had lost 6 million in the most recent quarter 24
million in the 12 months before that and 24 million in the year before
that in its entire corporate lifetime inktomi had never made a dime in
profits yet on march 17 2000 mr market valued this tiny business at
a total of 25 billion yes that is billion with a b

and then mr market went into a sudden nightmarish depression
on  september  30  2002  just  two  and  a  half  years  after  hitting
231625  per  share  inktomis  stock  closed  at  25  centscollapsing
from a total market value of 25 billion to less than 40 million had
inktomis business dried up not at all over the previous 12 months
the  company  had  generated  113  million  in  revenues  so  what  had
changed  only  mr  markets  mood  in  early  2000  investors  were 
so  wild  about  the  internet  that  they  priced  inktomis  shares  at  250
times  the  companys  revenues  now  however  they  would  pay  only
035 times its revenues mr market had morphed from dr jekyll to mr
hyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool
out of him

but mr market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he
had been in his manic euphoria on december 23 2002 yahoo inc
announced  that  it  would  buy  inktomi  for  165  per  share  that  was
nearly seven times inktomis stock price on september 30 history will
probably  show  that  yahoo  got  a  bargain  when  mr  market  makes
stocks  so  cheap  its  no  wonder  that  entire  companies  get  bought
right out from under him2

2 as graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932 the great depres
sion caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the value of
their  cash  and  other  liquid  assets  making  them  worth  more  dead  than
alive

would you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least five
times a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he feels
would you ever agree to be euphoric just because he isor miserable
just because he thinks you should be of course not you would insist on
your  right  to  take  control  of  your  own  emotional  life  based  on  your
experiences  and  your  beliefs  but  when  it  comes  to  their  financial
lives millions of people let mr market tell them how to feel and what to
dodespite the obvious fact that from time to time he can get nuttier
than a fruitcake

in  1999  when  mr  market  was  squealing  with  delight  american
employees directed an average of 86 of their paychecks into their
401k  retirement  plans  by  2002  after  mr  market  had  spent  three
years stuffing stocks into black garbage bags the average contribu
tion rate had dropped by nearly onequarter to just 73 the cheaper
stocks got the less eager people became to buy thembecause they
were imitating mr market instead of thinking for themselves

the intelligent investor should not ignore mr market entirely instead
you should do business with himbut only to the extent that it serves
your interests mr markets job is to provide you with prices your job
is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them you do not
have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to

by refusing to let mr market be your master you transform him into
your servant after all even when he seems to be destroying values
he is creating them elsewhere in 1999 the wilshire 5000 indexthe

startup firms went up an astonishing 9399 in 1999 meanwhile berk
shire hathawaythe holding company through which grahams greatest
disciple  warren  buffett  owns  such  old  economy  stalwarts  as  coca
cola gillette and the washington post codropped by 2494

but  then  as  it  so  often  does  the  market  had  a  sudden  mood
swing figure 81 offers a sampling of how the stinkers of 1999 be
came the stars of 2000 through 2002

as for those two holding companies cmgi went on to lose 96 in
2000 another 709 in 2001 and still 398 more in 2002a cumulative
loss of 993 berkshire hathaway went up 266 in 2000 and 65 in
2001 then had a slight 38 loss in 2002a cumulative gain of 30

one  of  grahams  most  powerful  insights  is  this  the  investor  who
permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified mar
ket declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advan
tage into a basic disadvantage

what does graham mean by those words basic advantage he
means  that  the  intelligent  individual  investor  has  the  full  freedom  to
choose  whether  or  not  to  follow  mr  market  you  have  the  luxury  of
being able to think for yourself5

4 a few months later on march 10 2000the very day that nasdaq hit its all
time highonline trading pundit james j cramer wrote that he had repeat
edly been tempted in recent days to sell berkshire hathaway short a bet that
buffetts stock had farther to fall with a vulgar thrust of his rhetorical pelvis
cramer even declared that berkshires shares were ripe for the banging that
same day market strategist ralph acampora of prudential securities asked
norfolk southern or cisco systems where do you want to be in the future
cisco a key to tomorrows internet superhighway seemed to have it all over
norfolk southern part of yesterdays railroad system over the next year nor
folk southern gained 35 while cisco lost 70
5 when asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding gra
ham had a concise answer the primary because of failure is that they pay too
much attention to what the stock market is doing currently see benjamin

commentary on chapter 8

the typical money manager however has no choice but to mimic mr
markets  every  movebuying  high  selling  low  marching  almost  mind
lessly in his erratic footsteps here are some of the handicaps mutual
fund managers and other professional investors are saddled with





 with  billions  of  dollars  under  management  they  must  gravitate
toward  the  biggest  stocksthe  only  ones  they  can  buy  in  the 
multimilliondollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios thus
many funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants
investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises
the managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they
already own driving prices to even more dangerous heights
if fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops
the managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out just as
the  funds  are  forced  to  buy  stocks  at  inflated  prices  in  a  rising
market they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again
 many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market so
they  obsessively  measure  their  returns  against  benchmarks  like
the s  p 500 index if a company gets added to an index hun
dreds of funds compulsively buy it if they do not and that stock
then  does  well  the  managers  look  foolish  on  the  other  hand  if
they buy it and it does poorly no one will blame them
increasingly fund managers are expected to specialize just as in
medicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric
allergist  and  the  geriatric  otolaryngologist  fund  managers  must
buy only small growth stocks or only midsized value stocks
or nothing but large blend stocks6 if a company gets too big or
too small or too cheap or an itty bit too expensive the fund has
to sell iteven if the manager loves the stock



so there is no reason you cannot do as well as the pros what you
cannot  do  despite  all  the  pundits  who  say  you  can  is  to  beat  the
pros  at  their  own  game  the  pros  cannot  even  win  their  own  game
why should you want to play it at all if you follow their rules you will
losesince you will end up as much a slave to mr market as the pro
fessionals are

6 never  mind  what  these  terms  mean  or  are  supposed  to  mean  while  in
public  these  classifications  are  treated  with  the  utmost  respect  in  private
most people in the investment business regard them with the contempt nor
mally reserved for jokes that are not funny

instead  recognize  that  investing  intelligently  is  about  controlling
the controllable you cannot control whether the stocks or funds you buy
will outperform the market today next week this month or this year in
the short run your returns will always be hostage to mr market and
his whims but you can control












your brokerage costs by trading rarely patiently and cheaply
your  ownership  costs by  refusing  to  buy  mutual  funds  with
excessive annual expenses
your expectations by using realism not fantasy to forecast your
returns7
your  risk by  deciding  how  much  of  your  total  assets  to  put  at
hazard in the stock market by diversifying and by rebalancing
your tax bills by holding stocks for at least one year and when
ever possible for at least five years to lower your capitalgains lia
bility
and most of all your own behavior

if you listen to financial tv or read most market columnists you would
think that investing is some kind of sport or a war or a struggle for
survival in a hostile wilderness but investing is not about beating oth
ers  at  their  game  its  about  controlling  yourself  at  your  own  game
the challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that
will go up the most and down the least but rather to prevent yourself
from being your own worst enemyfrom buying high just because mr
market says buy and from selling low just because mr market says
sell

if you investment horizon is longat least 25 or 30 yearsthere is
only  one  sensible  approach  buy  every  month  automatically  and
whenever else you can spare some money the single best choice for
this lifelong holding is a total stockmarket index fund sell only when
you need the cash for a psychological boost clip out and sign your
investment owners contractwhich you can find on p 225

to be  an  intelligent  investor  you  must  also  refuse  to  judge  your
financial success by how a bunch of total strangers are doing you are
not  one  penny  poorer  if  someone  in  dubuque  or  dallas  or  denver

beats the s  p 500 and you do not no ones gravestone reads he
beat the market

i  once  interviewed  a  group  of  retirees  in  boca  raton  one  of
floridas  wealthiest  retirement  communities  i  asked  these  people
mostly  in  their  seventiesif  they  had  beaten  the  market  over  their
investing lifetimes some said yes some said no most were not sure
then one man said who cares all i know is my investments earned
enough for me to end up in boca

could there be a more perfect answer after all the whole point of
investing is not to earn more money than average but to earn enough
money to meet your own needs the best way to measure your invest
ing  success  is  not  by  whether  you are  beating  the  market  but  by
whether you have put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline
that are likely to get you where you want to go in the end what mat
ters is not crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making
sure that you do cross it8

y o you are   m o n e y   a n d   y o you are   b r a i n

why then do investors find mr market so seductive it turns out that
our brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble humans are
patternseeking animals psychologists have shown that if you present
people  with  a  random  sequenceand  tell  them  that  its  unpre
dictablethey will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what is coming
next likewise we know that the next roll of the dice will be a seven
that a baseball player is due for a base hit that the next winning num
ber  in  the  powerball  lottery  will  definitely  be  4279164210and
that this hot little stock is the next microsoft

groundbreaking  new  research  in  neuroscience  shows  that  our
brains  are  designed  to  perceive  trends  even  where  they  might  not
exist after an event occurs just two or three times in a row regions of
the human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens
automatically  anticipate  that  it  will  happen  again  if  it  does  repeat  a
natural chemical called dopamine is released flooding your brain with
a  soft  euphoria  thus  if  a  stock  goes  up  a  few  times  in  a  row  you
reflexively expect it to keep goingand your brain chemistry changes

as the stock rises giving you a natural high you effectively become
addicted to your own predictions

but when stocks drop that financial loss fires up your amygdala
the part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the
famous fight or flight response that is common to all cornered ani
mals just as you cannot keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm
goes off just as you cannot avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto
your hiking path you cannot help feeling fearful when stock prices are
plunging9

in fact the brilliant psychologists daniel kahneman and amos tver
sky have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as
intense  as  the  pleasure  of  an  equivalent  gain  making  1000  on  a
stock feels greatbut a 1000 loss wields an emotional wallop more
than twice as powerful losing money is so painful that many people
terrified at the prospect of any further loss sell out near the bottom or
refuse to buy more

that helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market
decline  and  forget  to  put  the  loss  in  proportion  so  if  a  tv  reporter
hollers the market is plungingthe dow is down 100 points  most
people instinctively shudder but at the dows recent level of 8000
that is a drop of just 12 now think how ridiculous it would sound if
on a day when its 81 degrees outside the tv weatherman shrieked
the  temperature  is  plungingits  dropped  from  81  degrees to 80
degrees  that too is a 12 drop when you forget to view chang
ing market prices in percentage terms its all too easy to panic over
minor  vibrations  if  you  have  decades  of  investing  ahead  of  you
there is a better way to visualize the financial news broadcasts see the
sidebar on p 222

in the late 1990s many people came to feel that they were in the
dark  unless  they  checked  the  prices  of  their  stocks  several  times  a
day but as graham puts it the typical investor would be better off if
his stocks had no market quotation at all for he would then be spared
the  mental  anguish  caused  him  by  other  persons mistakes  of  judg

stocks are crashing so you turn on the television to catch the
latest market news but instead of cnbc or cnn imagine that
you can tune in to the benjamin graham financial network on
bgfn the audio does not capture that famous sour clang of the
markets  closing  bell  the  video  does not  home  in  on  brokers
scurrying  across  the  floor  of  the  stock  exchange  like  angry
rodents nor does bgfn run any footage of investors gasping
on frozen sidewalks as red arrows whiz overhead on electronic
stock tickers

instead the image that fills your tv screen is the facade of
the  new  york  stock  exchange  festooned  with  a  huge  banner
reading  sale  50  off  as  intro  music  bachmanturner
overdrive  can  be  heard  blaring  a  few  bars  of  their  old  barn
burner  you  are not  seen  nothin  yet  then  the  anchorman
announces  brightly  stocks  became  more  attractive  yet  again
today as the dow dropped another 25 on heavy volumethe
fourth  day  in  a  row that  stocks  have  gotten  cheaper tech
investors fared even better as leading companies like microsoft
lost nearly 5 on the day making them even more affordable
that comes on top of the good news of the past year in which
stocks have already lost 50 putting them at bargain levels not
seen in years and some prominent analysts are optimistic that
prices may drop still further in the weeks and months to come
the newscast cuts over to market strategist ignatz anderson
of  the  wall  street  firm  of  ketchum    skinner  who  says  my
forecast  is  for  stocks  to  lose  another  15 by  june  i am  cau
tiously optimistic that if everything goes well stocks could lose
25 maybe more

let us hope ignatz anderson is right the anchor says cheer
ily  falling stock  prices  would  be  fabulous news  for  any
investor with a very long horizon and now over to wally wood

ment if after checking the value of your stock portfolio at 124  pm
you feel compelled to check it all over again at 137 pm ask yourself
these questions







did  i  call  a  realestate  agent  to  check  the  market  price  of  my
house at 124 pm did i call back at 137 pm
if  i  had  would  the  price  have  changed  if  it  did  would  i  have
rushed to sell my house
by not checking or even knowing the market price of my house
from minute to minute do i prevent its value from rising over time 10

the only possible answer to these questions is of course not and
you should view your portfolio the same way over a 10 or 20 or 30
year investment horizon mr markets daily dipsydoodles simply do not
matter in any case for anyone who will be investing for years to come
falling stock prices are good news not bad since they enable you to
buy more for less money the longer and further stocks fall and the
more steadily you keep buying as they drop the more money you will
make in the endif you remain steadfast until the end instead of fear
ing  a  bear  market  you  should  embrace  it  the  intelligent  investor
should be perfectly comfortable owning a stock or mutual fund even if
the stock market stopped supplying daily prices for the next 10 years11
paradoxically you will be much more in control explains neurosci
entist antonio damasio if you realize how much you are not in con
trol by acknowledging your biological tendency to buy high and sell
low  you  can  admit  the  need  to  dollarcost  average  rebalance  and
sign an investment contract by putting much of your portfolio on per
manent autopilot you can fight the prediction addiction focus on your
longterm financial goals and tune out mr markets mood swings

10 its also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your house if its
market  price  was  reported  to  the  last  penny  every  day  in  the  newspapers
and on tv
11 in a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s a psychologist at
columbia  and  harvard  paul  andreassen  showed  that  investors  who
received frequent news updates on their stocks earned half the returns of
investors who got no news at all see jason zweig here is how to use the
news and tune out the noise money july 1998 pp 6364

although  graham  teaches  that  you  should  buy  when  mr  market  is
yelling  sell  there is  one  exception  the  intelligent  investor  needs  to
understand selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a
tax windfall the us internal revenue code allows you to use your
realized losses any declines in value that you lock in by selling your
shares  to  offset  up  to  3000  in  ordinary  income12 let us  say  you
bought  200  shares  of  cocacola  stock  in  january  2000  for  60  a
sharea  total  investment  of  12000  by  yearend  2002  the  stock
was down to 44 a share or 8800 for your lota loss of 3200

you  could  have  done  what  most  people  doeither  whine  about
your loss or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened
or you could have taken control before 2002 ended you could have
sold all your coke shares locking in the 3200 loss then after wait
ing 31 days to comply with irs rules you would buy 200 shares of
coke all over again the result you would be able to reduce your tax
able  income  by  3000  in  2002  and  you  could  use  the  remaining
200 loss to offset your income in 2003 and better yet you would
still own a company whose future you believe inbut now you would
own it for almost onethird less than you paid the first time13

with uncle sam subsidizing your losses it can make sense to sell
and lock in a loss if uncle sam wants to make mr market look logical
by comparison who are we to complain

12 federal tax law is subject to constant change the example of cocacola
stock given here is valid under the provisions of the us tax code as it stood
in early 2003
13 this  example  assumes  that  the  investor  had  no  realized  capital  gains  in
2002  and  did  not  reinvest  any  coke  dividends  tax  swaps  are  not  to  be
undertaken lightly since they can be mishandled easily before doing a tax
swap  read  irs  publication  550  wwwirsgovpubirspdfp550pdf  a

investing in investment funds

one  course  open  to  the  defensive  investor  is  to  put  his  money
into  investmentcompany  shares  those  that  are  redeemable  on
demand by the holder at net asset value are commonly known as
mutual funds or openend funds most of these are actively
selling additional shares through a corps of salesmen those with
nonredeemable shares are called closedend companies or funds
the  number  of  their  shares  remains  relatively  constant all  of  the
funds  of  any  importance  are  registered  with  the  securities  
exchange commission sec and are subject to its regulations and
controls

the industry is a very large one at the end of 1970 there were
383 funds registered with the sec having assets totaling 546 bil
lions  of  these  356  companies  with  506  billions  were  mutual
funds and 27 companies with 40 billions were closedend

there are different ways of classifying the funds one is by the
broad division of their portfolio they are balanced funds if they
have a significant generally about onethird component of bonds
or  stockfunds  if  their  holdings  are  nearly  all  common  stocks
there are some other varieties here such as bond funds hedge

 it is a violation of federal law for an openend mutual fund a closedend
fund or an exchangetraded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has
registered or made mandatory financial filings with the sec
 the  fund  industry  has  gone  from  very  large  to  immense  at  yearend
2002 there were 8279 mutual funds holding 656 trillion 514 closedend
funds with 1496 billion in assets and 116 exchangetrade funds or etfs
with  1097  billion  these  figures  exclude  such  fundlike  investments  as
variable annuities and unit investment trusts

funds letterstock funds etc another is by their objectives as
their primary aim is for income price stability or capital apprecia
tion  growth  another  distinction  is  by  their  method  of  sale
load  funds  add  a  selling  charge  generally  about  9  of  asset
value on minimum purchases to the value before charge1 others
known  as  noload  funds  make  no  such  charge  the  manage
ments are content with the usual investmentcounsel fees for han
dling  the  capital  since  they  cannot  pay  salesmens  commissions
the size of the noload funds tends to be on the low side the buy
ing  and  selling  prices  of  the  closedend funds  are  not  fixed  by  the
companies but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary
corporate stock

most of the companies operate under special provisions of the
incometax law designed to relieve the shareholders from double
taxation  on  their  earnings  in  effect  the  funds  must  pay  out  vir
tually  all  their  ordinary  incomeie  dividends  and  interest
received less expenses in addition they can pay out their realized
longterm profits on sales of investmentsin the form of capital
gains dividendswhich are treated by the shareholder as if they
were his own security profits there is another option here which
we omit to avoid clutter nearly all the funds have but one class

 lists  of  the  major  types  of  mutual  funds  can  be  found  at  wwwiciorg
pdfg2understandingpdf  and  httpnewsmorningstarcomfundreturns
categoryreturnshtml letterstock funds no longer exist while hedge funds
are  generally  banned  by  sec  rules  from  selling  shares  to  any  investor
whose annual income is below 200000 or whose net worth is below 1
million
 today the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around 575
if you invest 10000 in a fund with a flat 575 sales load 575 will go to
the person and brokerage firm that sold it to you leaving you with an initial
net investment of 9425 the 575 sales charge is actually 61 of that
amount  which  is  why  graham  calls  the  standard  way  of  calculating  the
charge  a  sales  gimmick  since  the  1980s  noload  funds  have  become
popular and they no longer tend to be smaller than load funds
 nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a regulated investment company
or  ric  which  is  exempt  from  corporate  income  tax  so  long  as  it 
pays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders in the option that

the intelligent investor

of security outstanding a new wrinkle introduced in 1967 divides
the capitalization into a preferred issue which will receive all the
ordinary income and a capital issue or common stock which will
receive  all  the  profits  on  security  sales  these  are  called  dual
purpose funds

many of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital
gains concentrate on the purchase of the socalled growth stocks
and they often have the word growth in their name some spe
cialize  in  a  designated  area  such  as  chemicals  aviation  overseas
investments this is usually indicated in their titles

the investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in
fund shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of
choices before himnot too different from those offered in direct
investment  in  this  chapter  we  shall  deal  with  some  major  ques
tions viz

1 is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of
better than average results by choosing the right funds subques
tion what about the performance funds

2  if  not  how  can  he  avoid  choosing  funds  that  will  give  him

worse than average results

3  can  he  make  intelligent  choices  between  different  types  of
fundseg  balanced  versus  allstock  openend  versus  closed
end load versus noload

graham omits to avoid clutter a fund can ask the sec for special permis
sion  to  distribute  one  of  its  holdings  directly  to  the  funds  shareholdersas 
his grahamnewman corp did in 1948 parceling out shares in geico to
grahamnewmans own investors this sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare
 dualpurpose  funds  popular  in  the  late  1980s  have  essentially  disap
peared from the marketplacea shame since they offered investors a more
flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like john
neff  perhaps  the  recent  bear  market  will  lead  to  a  renaissance  of  this
attractive investment vehicle
 performance funds were all the rage in the late 1960s they were equiv
alent  to  the  aggressive  growth  funds  of  the  late  1990s  and  served  their
investors no better

investing in investment funds

229

investmentfund performance as a whole

before  trying  to  answer  these  questions  we  should  say  some
thing about the performance of the fund industry as a whole has
it  done  a  good  job  for  its  shareholders  in  the  most  general  way
how  have  fund  investors  fared  as  against  those  who  made  their
investments  directly  we  are  quite  certain  that  the  funds  in  the
aggregate  have  served  a  useful  purpose  they  have  promoted
good habits of savings and investment they have protected count
less  individuals  against  costly  mistakes  in  the  stock  market  they
have brought their participants income and profits commensurate
with  the  overall  returns  from  common  stocks  on  a  comparative
basis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who
put  his  money  exclusively  in  investmentfund  shares  in  the  past
ten years has fared better than the average person who made his
commonstock purchases directly

the  last  point  is  probably  true  even  though  the  actual  perfor
mance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com
mon  stocks  as  a  whole  and  even  though  the  cost  of  investing  in
mutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases
the  real  choice  of  the  average  individual  has  not  been  between
constructing and acquiring a wellbalanced commonstock portfo
lio or doing the same thing a bit more expensively by buying into
the funds more likely his choice has been between succumbing to
the wiles of the doorbellringing mutualfund salesman on the one
hand  as  against  succumbing  to  the  even  wilier  and  much  more
dangerous  peddlers  of  second  and  thirdrate  new  offerings  we
cannot help thinking too that the average individual who opens a
brokerage account with the idea of making conservative common
stock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ
ences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses these
temptations should be much less for the mutualfund buyer

but  how  have  the  investment  funds  performed  as  against  the
general market this is a somewhat controversial subject but we
shall  try  to  deal  with  it  in  simple  but  adequate  fashion  table  91
gives some calculated results for 19611970 of our ten largest stock
funds  at  the  end  of  1970  but  choosing  only  the  largest  one  from
each management group it summarizes the overall return of each
of  these  funds  for  19611965  19661970  and  for  the  single  years

1969  and  1970  we  also  give  average  results  based  on  the  sum  of
one share of each of the ten funds these companies had combined
assets of over 15 billion at the end of 1969 or about onethird of all
the commonstock funds thus they should be fairly representative
of the industry as a whole in theory there should be a bias in this
list on the side of better than industry performance since these bet
ter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion
than the others but this may not be the case in practice

some interesting facts can be gathered from this table first we
find that the overall results of these ten funds for 19611970 were
not appreciably different from those of the standard  poors 500
stock  composite  average  or  the  s    p 425industrial  stock  aver
age but they were definitely better than those of the djia this
raises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the djia
did  worse  than  the  much  more  numerous  and  apparently  rather
miscellaneous list used by standard  poors a second point is
that the funds aggregate performance as against the s  p index
has improved somewhat in the last five years compared with the
preceding  five  the  funds  gain  ran  a  little  lower  than  s    ps  in
19611965 and a little higher than s  ps in 19661970 the third
point is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi
vidual funds

we do not think the mutualfund industry can be criticized for
doing  no  better  than  the  market  as  a  whole  their  managers  and
their professional competitors administer so large a portion of all
marketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a
whole must necessarily happen approximately to the sum of their
funds  note  that  the  trust  assets  of  insured  commercial  banks
included  181  billion  of  common  stocks  at  the  end  of  1969  if  we
add to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment
advisers plus the 56 billion of mutual and similar funds we must
conclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty
well determine the movements of the stock averages and that the

 for periods as long as 10 years the returns of the dow and the s  p 500
can diverge by fairly wide margins over the course of the typical investing
lifetime howeversay 25 to 50 yearstheir returns have tended to converge
quite closely

232

the intelligent investor

movement of the stock averages pretty well determines the funds
aggregate results

are there better than average funds and can the investor select
these  so  as  to  obtain  superior  results  for  himself  obviously  all
investors  could  not  do  this  since  in  that  case  we  would  soon  be
back where we started with no one doing better than anyone else
let  us  consider  the  question  first  in  a  simplified  fashion  why
should not the investor find out what fund has made the best show
ing of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past assume
from this that its management is the most capable and will there
fore do better than average in the future and put his money in that
fund this idea appears the more practicable because in the case
of the mutual funds he could obtain this most capable manage
ment  without  paying  any  special  premium  for  it  as  against  the
other funds by contrast among noninvestment corporations the
bestmanaged  companies  sell  at  correspondingly  high  prices  in
relation to their current earnings and assets

the evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years
but our table 91 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the
results shown by the top five performers of 19611965 carried over
on the whole through 19661970 even though two of this set did not
do  as  well  as  two  of  the  other  five  our  studies  indicate  that  the
investor  in  mutualfund  shares  may  properly  consider  compara
tive performance over a period of years in the past say at least five
provided the data do not represent a large net upward movement of
the  market  as  a  whole  in  the  latter  case  spectacularly  favorable
results  may  be  achieved  in  unorthodox  waysas  will  be  demon
strated  in  our  following  section  on  performance  funds  such
results in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are
taking undue speculative risks and getting away with same for the
time being

performance funds

one of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance
of  the  cult  of  performance  in  the  management  of  investment
funds  and  even  of  many  trust  funds  we  must  start  this  section
with  the  important  disclaimer  that  it  does  not  apply  to  the  large
majority  of  wellestablished  funds  but  only  to  a  relatively  small

investing in investment funds

233

section  of  the  industry  which  has  attracted  a  disproportionate
amount of attention the story is simple enough some of those in
charge  set  out  to  get  much  better  than  average  or  djia  results
they  succeeded  in  doing  this  for  a  while  garnering  considerable
publicity and additional funds to manage the aim was legitimate
enough unfortunately it appears that in the context of investing
really  sizable  funds  the  aim  cannot  be  accomplished  without
incurring sizable risks and in a comparatively short time the risks
came home to roost

several  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  performance
phenomenon  caused  ominous  headshaking  by  those  of  us  whose
experience  went  far  backeven  to  the  1920sand  whose  views
for that very reason were considered oldfashioned and irrelevant
to  this  second  new  era  in  the  first  place  and  on  this  very
point  nearly  all  these  brilliant  performers  were  young  menin
their  thirties  and  fortieswhose  direct  financial  experience  was
limited  to  the  all  but  continuous  bull  market  of  19481968  sec
ondly they often acted as if the definition of a sound investment
was a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the
next few months this led to large commitments in newer ventures
at  prices  completely  disproportionate  to  their  assets  or  recorded
earnings they could be justified only by a combination of naive
hope  in  the  future  accomplishments  of  these  enterprises  with  an
apparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of
the uninformed and greedy public

this  section  will  not  mention  peoples  names  but  we  have
every reason to give concrete examples of companies the perfor
mance fund most in the publics eye was undoubtedly manhattan
fund inc organized at the end of 1965 its first offering was of 27
million shares at 925 to 10 per share the company started out
with 247 million of capital its emphasis was of course on capital
gains most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul
tipliers  of  current  earnings  paying  no  dividends  or  very  small
ones  with  a  large  speculative  following  and  spectacular  price
movements  the  fund  showed  an  overall  gain  of  386  in  1967
against 11 for the s  p composite index but thereafter its perfor
mance left much to be desired as is shown in table 92

the  portfolio  of  manhattan  fund  at  the  end  of  1969  was
unorthodox to say the least it is an extraordinary fact that two of
its largest investments were in companies that filed for bankruptcy
within six months thereafter and a third faced creditors actions in
1971 it is another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of
these  doomed  companies  were  bought  not  only  by  investment
funds but by university endowment funds the trust departments
of  large  banking  institutions  and  the  like a third  extraordinary
fact  was  that  the  foundermanager  of  manhattan  fund  sold  his
stock in a separately organized management company to another
large concern for over 20 million in its stock at that time the man
agement  company  sold  had  less  than  1  million  in  assets  this  is
undoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between the
results for the manager and the managees

a book published at the end of 1969 2 provided profiles of nine
teen men who are tops at the demanding game of managing bil
lions  of  dollars  of  other  peoples  money  the  summary  told  us
further that they are young    some earn more than a million dol
lars  a  year    they  are  a  new  financial  breed    they  all  have  a
total  fascination  with  the  market    and  a  spectacular  knack  for
coming  up  with  winners  a fairly  good  idea  of  the  accomplish
ments  of  this  top  group  can  be  obtained  by  examining  the  pub
lished results of the funds they manage such results are available
for funds directed by twelve of the nineteen persons described in
the  money  managers typically  enough  they  showed  up  well  in
1966  and  brilliantly  in  1967  in  1968  their  performance  was  still
good  in  the  aggregate  but  mixed  as  to  individual  funds  in  1969
they all showed losses with only one managing to do a bit better
than the s  p composite index in 1970 their comparative perfor
mance was even worse than in 1969

 one of the doomed companies graham refers to was national student
marketing  corp  a  con  game  masquerading  as  a  stock  whose  saga  was
told brilliantly in andrew tobiass the funny money game playboy press
new york 1971 among the supposedly sophisticated investors who were
snookered  by  nsms  charismatic  founder  cort  randell  were  the  endow
ment funds of cornell and harvard and the trust departments at such presti
gious banks as morgan guaranty and bankers trust

236

the intelligent investor

we have presented this picture in order to point a moral which
perhaps can best be expressed by the old french proverb plus ca
change  plus  cest  la  meme  chose bright  energetic  peopleusually
quite  younghave  promised  to  perform  miracles  with  other
peoples money since time immemorial they have usually been
able to do it for a whileor at least to appear to have done itand
they  have  inevitably  brought  losses  to  their  public  in  the  end
about a half century ago the miracles were often accompanied
by  flagrant  manipulation  misleading  corporate  reporting  outra
geous capitalization structures and other semifraudulent financial
practices all this brought on an elaborate system of financial con
trols  by  the  sec  as  well  as  a  cautious  attitude  toward  common
stocks on the part of the general public the operations of the new
money  managers  in  19651969  came  a  little  more  than  one  full
generation after the shenanigans of 19261929 the specific mal
practices banned after the 1929 crash were no longer resorted to
they involved the risk of jail sentences but in many corners of wall
street  they  were  replaced  by  newer  gadgets  and  gimmicks  that
produced very similar results in the end outright manipulation of
prices disappeared but there were many other methods of draw
ing the gullible publics attention to the profit possibilities in hot
issues  blocks  of  letter  stock 3 could  be  bought  well  below  the
quoted  market  price  subject  to  undisclosed  restrictions  on  their
sale they could immediately be carried in the reports at their full
market value showing a lovely and illusory profit and so on it is

 as only the latest proof that the more things change the more they stay
the same consider that ryan jacob a 29yearold boy wonder launched
the jacob internet fund at yearend 1999 after producing a 216 return at
his  previous  dotcom  fund  investors  poured  nearly  300  million  into
jacobs  fund  in  the  first  few  weeks  of  2000  it  then  proceeded  to  lose
791 in 2000 564 in 2001 and 13 in 2002a cumulative collapse of
92 that loss may have made mr jacobs investors even older and wiser
than it made him
 intriguingly  the  disastrous  boom  and  bust  of  19992002  also  came
roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity perhaps it takes about
35 years for the investors who remember the last new economy craze to
become less influential than those who do not if this intuition is correct the
intelligent investor should be particularly vigilant around the year 2030

amazing  how  in  a  completely  different  atmosphere  of  regulation
and prohibitions wall street was able to duplicate so much of the
excesses and errors of the 1920s

no  doubt  there  will  be  new  regulations  and  new  prohibitions
the  specific  abuses  of  the  late  1960s  will  be  fairly  adequately
banned from wall street but it is probably too much to expect that
the urge to speculate will ever disappear or that the exploitation of
that urge can ever be abolished it is part of the armament of the
intelligent  investor  to  know  about  these  extraordinary  popular
delusions 4 and to keep as far away from them as possible

the picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we
start after their  spectacular  record  in  1967  with  the  1967  figures
included  their  overall  showing  is  not  at  all  disastrous  on  that
basis one of the money managers operators did quite a bit better
than the s  p composite index three did distinctly worse and six
did about the same let us take as a check another group of perfor
mance  fundsthe  ten  that  made  the  best  showing  in  1967  with
gains  ranging  from  84  up  to  301  in  that  single  year  of  these
four  gave  a  better  overall  fouryear  performance  than  the  s    p
index if the 1967 gains are included and two excelled the index in
19681970  none  of  these  funds  was  large  and  the  average  size
was  about  60  million  thus  there  is  a  strong  indication  that
smaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand
ing results

the  foregoing  account  contains  the  implicit  conclusion  that
there may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor
mance  by  investmentfund  managers all  financial  experience  up
to now indicates that large funds soundly managed can produce
at  best  only  slightly  better  than  average  results  over  the  years  if
they  are  unsoundly  managed  they  can  produce  spectacular  but
largely illusory profits for a while followed inevitably by calami
tous  losses  there  have  been  instances  of  funds  that  have  consis
tently  outperformed  the  market  averages  for  say  ten  years  or
more but these have been scarce exceptions having most of their
operations  in  specialized  fields  with  selfimposed  limits  on  the
capital employedand not actively sold to the public

 todays equivalent of grahams scarce exceptions tend to be openend
funds  that  are  closed  to  new  investorsmeaning  that  the  managers  have

the intelligent investor

closedend versus openend funds

almost  all  the  mutual  funds  or  openend  funds  which  offer
their holders the right to cash in their shares at each days valua
tion  of  the  portfolio  have  a  corresponding  machinery  for  selling
new shares by this means most of them have grown in size over
the  years  the  closedend  companies  nearly  all  of  which  were
organized a long time ago have a fixed capital structure and thus
have  diminished  in  relative  dollar  importance  openend  compa
nies are being sold by many thousands of energetic and persuasive
salesmen the closedend shares have no one especially interested
in distributing them consequently it has been possible to sell most
mutual  funds  to  the  public  at  a  fixed  premium  of  about  9
above  net  asset  value  to  cover  salesmens  commissions  etc
while  the  majority  of  closeend  shares  have  been  consistently
obtainable at less than their asset value this price discount has var
ied among individual companies and the average discount for the
group as a whole has also varied from one date to another figures
on this point for 19611970 are given in table 93

it does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower rela
tive price for closedend as against openend shares has very little
to do with the difference in the overall investment results between
the two groups that this is true is indicated by the comparison of
the  annual  results  for  19611970  of  the  two  groups  included  in
table 93

thus  we  arrive  at  one  of  the  few  clearly  evident  rules  for
investors choices if you want to put money in investment funds
buy a group of closedend shares at a discount of say 10 to 15
from asset value instead of paying a premium of about 9 above
asset value for shares of an openend company assuming that the
future dividends and changes in asset values continue to be about
the same for the two groups you will thus obtain about onefifth
more for your money from the closedend shares

the  mutualfund  salesman  will  be  quick  to  counter  with  the

stopped taking in any more cash while that reduces the management fees
they can earn it maximizes the returns their existing shareholders can earn
because most fund managers would rather look out for no 1 than be no 1
closing a fund to new investors is a rare and courageous step

argument ah but if you own closedend shares you can never be
sure what price you can sell them for the discount can be greater
than  it  is  today  and  you  will  suffer  from  the  wider  spread  with
our  shares  you  are  guaranteed  the  right  to  turn  in  your  shares  at
100  of  asset  value  never  less  let  us  examine  this  argument  a
bit  it  will  be  a  good  exercise  in  logic  and  plain  common  sense
question assuming  that  the  discount  on  closedend  shares  does
widen how likely is it that you will be worse off with those shares
than with an otherwise equivalent purchase of openend shares

this  calls  for  a  little  arithmetic  assume  that  investor  a buys
some openend shares at 109 of asset value and investor b buys
closedend shares at 85 thereof plus 112 commission both sets
of shares earn and pay 30 of this asset value in say four years

and  end  up  with  the  same  value  as  at  the  beginning  investor a
redeems  his  shares  at  100  of  value  losing  the  9  premium  he
paid  his  overall  return  for  the  period  is  30  less  9  or  21  on
asset  value  this  in  turn  is  19  on  his  investment  how  much
must investor b realize on his closedend shares to obtain the same
return  on  his  investment  as  investor a  the  answer  is  73  or  a
discount  of  27  from  asset  value  in  other  words  the  closedend
man  could  suffer  a  widening  of  12  points  in  the  market  discount
about  double  before  his  return  would  get  down  to  that  of  the
openend investor an adverse change of this magnitude has hap
pened rarely if ever in the history of closedend shares hence it is
very  unlikely  that  you  will  obtain  a  lower  overall  return  from  a
representative  closedend  company  bought  at  a  discount  if  its
investment performance is about equal to that of a representative
mutual  fund  if  a  smallload  or  noload  fund  is  substituted  for
one  with  the  usual  812  load  the  advantage  of  the  closedend
investment is of course reduced but it remains an advantage

the  fact  that  a  few  closedend  funds  are  selling  at  premiums
greater than the true 9 charge on most mutual funds introduces a
separate  question  for  the  investor  do  these  premium  companies
enjoy superior management of sufficient proven worth to warrant
their  elevated  prices  if  the  answer  is  sought  in  the  comparative
results for the past five or ten years the answer would appear to be
no  three  of  the  six  premium  companies  have  mainly  foreign
investments  a striking  feature  of  these  is  the  large  variation  in

a data from wiesenberger financial services

prices in a few years time at the end of 1970 one sold at only one
quarter of its high another at a third another at less than half if we
consider  the  three  domestic  companies  selling  above  asset  value
we find that the average of their tenyear overall returns was some
what better than that of ten discount funds but the opposite was
true in the last five years a comparison of the 19611970 record of
lehman corp and of general american investors two of our old
est and largest closedend companies is given in table 95 one of
these sold 14 above and the other 76 below its netasset value
at the end of 1970 the difference in price to netasset relationships
did not appear warranted by these figures

investment in balanced funds

the 23 balanced funds covered in the wiesenberger report had
between 25 and 59 of their assets in preferred stocks and bonds
the  average  being  just  40  the  balance  was  held  in  common
stocks  it  would  appear  more  logical  for  the  typical  investor  to
make his bondtype investments directly rather than to have them
form  part  of  a  mutualfund  commitment  the  average  income
return shown by these balanced funds in 1970 was only 39 per
annum on asset value or say 36 on the offering price the better
choice  for  the  bond  component  would  be  the  purchase  of  united
states savings bonds or corporate bonds rated a or better or tax
free bonds for the investors bond portfolio

a purely american creation the mutual fund was introduced in 1924
by a former salesman of aluminum pots and pans named edward g
leffler mutual funds are quite cheap very convenient generally diver
sified  professionally  managed  and  tightly  regulated  under  some  of
the toughest provisions of federal securities law by making investing
easy and affordable for almost anyone the funds have brought some
54 million american families and millions more around the world into
the  investing  mainstreamprobably  the  greatest  advance  in  financial
democracy ever achieved

but mutual funds are not perfect they are almost perfect and that
word  makes  all  the  difference  because  of  their  imperfections  most
funds underperform the market overcharge their investors create tax
headaches  and  suffer  erratic  swings  in  performance  the  intelligent
investor must choose funds with great care in order to avoid ending
up owning a big fat mess

most investors simply buy a fund that has been going up fast on the
assumption  that  it  will  keep  on  going  and  why  not  psychologists
have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the
long  run  can  be  predicted  from  even  a  short  series  of  outcomes
what is more we know from our own experience that some plumbers
are far better than others that some baseball players are much more
likely to hit home runs that our favorite restaurant serves consistently
superior food and that smart kids get consistently good grades skill
and brains and hard work are recognized rewardedand consistently
repeatedall  around  us  so  if  a  fund  beats  the  market  our  intuition
tells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming

unfortunately in the financial markets luck is more important than
skill if a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at 
just the right time he will look brilliantbut all too often what was hot
suddenly  goes  cold  and  the  managers  iq  seems  to  shrivel  by  50 
points figure 91 shows what happened to the hottest funds of 1999
this is yet another reminder that the markets hottest market sec
torin 1999 that was technologyoften turns as cold as liquid nitro
gen with blinding speed and utterly no warning1 and its a reminder
that buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the
stupidest  things  an  investor  can  do  financial  scholars  have  been
studying mutualfund performance for at least a half century and they
are virtually unanimous on several points






the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome
its costs of researching and trading them
the higher a funds expenses the lower its returns
the more frequently a fund trades its stocks the less it tends to
earn

1 sector  funds  specializing  in  almost  every  imaginable  industry  are  avail
ableand date back to the 1920s after nearly 80 years of history the evi
dence is overwhelming the most lucrative and thus most popular sector of
any given year often turns out to be among the worst performers of the fol
lowing year just as idle hands are the devils workshop sector funds are the
investors nemesis

highly volatile funds which bounce up and down more than aver
age are likely to stay volatile
funds  with  high  past  returns  are  unlikely  to  remain  winners  for
long2

your chances of selecting the topperforming funds of the future on
the basis of their returns in the past are about as high as the odds that
bigfoot and the abominable snowman will both show up in pink ballet
slippers at your next cocktail party in other words your chances are
not zerobut they are pretty close see sidebar p 255

but there is good news too first of all understanding why its so
hard  to  find  a  good  fund  will  help  you  become  a  more  intelligent
investor second while past performance is a poor predictor of future
returns there are other factors that you can use to increase your odds
of finding a good fund finally a fund can offer excellent value even if it
does not beat the marketby providing an economical way to diversify
your holdings and by freeing up your time for all the other things you
would rather be doing than picking your own stocks

t h e   f i r s t   s h a l l   b e   l a s t

why do not more winning funds stay winners

the better a fund performs the more obstacles its investors face
migrating  managers when  a  stock  picker  seems  to  have  the
midas  touch  everyone  wants  himincluding  rival  fund  companies 
if  you  bought  transamerica  premier  equity  fund  to  cash  in  on  the
skills of glen bickerstaff who gained 475 in 1997 you were quickly
out  of  luck  tcw  snatched  him  away  in  mid1998  to  run  its  tcw
galileo  select  equities  fund  and  the  transamerica  fund  lagged 
the  market  in  three  of  the  next  four  years  if  you  bought  fidelity
aggressive  growth  fund  in  early  2000  to  capitalize  on  the  high
returns  of  erin  sullivan  who  had  nearly  tripled  her  shareholders
money since 1997 oh well she quit to start her own hedge fund in

2000 and her former fund lost more than threequarters of its value
over the next three years3

asset  elephantiasis when  a  fund  earns  high  returns  investors
noticeoften pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of
weeks  that  leaves  the  fund  manager  with  few  choicesall  of  them
bad  he  can  keep  that  money  safe  for  a  rainy  day  but  then  the  low
returns on cash will crimp the funds results if stocks keep going up
he  can  put  the  new  money  into  the  stocks  he  already  ownswhich
have  probably  gone  up  since  he  first  bought  them  and  will  become
dangerously overvalued if he pumps in millions of dollars more or he
can buy new stocks he did not like well enough to own alreadybut he
will have to research them from scratch and keep an eye on far more
companies than he is used to following

finally when the 100million nimble fund puts 2 of its assets
or 2 million in minnow corp a stock with a total market value of
500 million its buying up less than onehalf of 1 of minnow but if
hot performance swells the nimble fund to 10 billion then an invest
ment  of  2  of  its  assets  would  total  200  millionnearly  half  the
entire value of minnow a level of ownership that is not even permissible
under  federal  law  if  nimbles  portfolio  manager  still  wants  to  own
small stocks he will have to spread his money over vastly more com
paniesand probably end up spreading his attention too thin

no more fancy footwork some companies specialize in incubat
ing  their  fundstestdriving  them  privately  before  selling  them  pub
licly  typically  the  only  shareholders  are  employees  and  affiliates  of
the fund company itself by keeping them tiny the sponsor can use
these  incubated  funds  as  guinea  pigs  for  risky  strategies  that  work
best with small sums of money like buying truly tiny stocks or rapidfire
trading of initial public offerings if its strategy succeeds the fund can
lure  public  investors  en  masse  by  publicizing  its  private  returns  in
other cases the fund manager waives or skips charging manage
ment fees raising the net returnthen slaps the fees on later after the
high returns attract plenty of customers almost without exception the
returns of incubated and feewaived funds have faded into mediocrity
after outside investors poured millions of dollars into them

3 that is not to say that these funds would have done better if their super
star managers had stayed in place all we can be sure of is that the two
funds did poorly without them

commentary on chapter 9

rising expenses it often costs more to trade stocks in very large
blocks than in small ones with fewer buyers and sellers its harder to
make a match a fund with 100 million in assets might pay 1 a year
in trading costs but if high returns send the fund mushrooming up to
10 billion its trades could easily eat up at least 2 of those assets
the typical fund holds on to its stocks for only 11 months at a time so
trading costs eat away at returns like a corrosive acid meanwhile the
other costs of running a fund rarely falland sometimes even riseas
assets  grow  with  operating  expenses  averaging  15  and  trading
costs  at  around  2  the  typical  fund  has  to  beat  the  market  by  35
percentage points per year before costs just to match it after costs

sheepish behavior finally once a fund becomes successful its
managers  tend  to  become  timid  and  imitative  as  a  fund  grows  its
fees  become  more  lucrativemaking  its  managers  reluctant  to  rock
the boat the very risks that the managers took to generate their initial
high returns could now drive investors awayand jeopardize all that fat
fee  income  so  the  biggest  funds  resemble  a  herd  of  identical  and
overfed  sheep  all  moving  in  sluggish  lockstep  all  saying  baaaa  at
the  same  time  nearly  every  growth  fund  owns  cisco  and  ge  and
microsoft  and  pfizer  and  walmartand  in  almost  identical  propor
tions this behavior is so prevalent that finance scholars simply call it
herding4 but by protecting their own fee income fund managers com
promise  their  ability  to  produce  superior  returns  for  their  outside
investors

4 there is  a  second  lesson  here  to  succeed  the  individual  investor  must
either avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that have already
been picked over by the giant institutions or own them far more patiently

because of their fat costs and bad behavior most funds fail to earn
their keep no wonder high returns are nearly as perishable as unre
frigerated fish what is more as time passes the drag of their exces
sive expenses leaves most funds farther and farther behind as figure
92 shows5

what then should the intelligent investor do
first of all recognize that an index fundwhich owns all the stocks

5 amazingly this illustration understates the advantage of index funds since
the  database  from  which  it  is  taken  does  not  include  the  track  records  of
hundreds  of  funds  that  disappeared  over  these  periods  measured  more
accurately the advantage of indexing would be overpowering

in the market all the time without any pretense of being able to select
the best and avoid the worstwill beat most funds over the long
run  if  your  company  does not  offer  a  lowcost  index  fund  in  your
401k organize your coworkers and petition to have one added its
rockbottom  overheadoperating  expenses  of  02  annually  and
yearly trading costs of just 01give the index fund an insurmount
able advantage if stocks generate say a 7 annualized return over
the  next  20  years  a  lowcost  index  fund  like  vanguard  total  stock
market will return just under 67 that would turn a 10000 invest
ment  into  more  than  36000  but  the  average  stock  fund  with 
its 15 in operating expenses and roughly 2 in trading costs will
be  lucky  to  gain  35  annually  that  would  turn  10000  into  just
under  20000or  nearly  50  less than  the  result  from  the  index
fund

index funds have only one significant flaw they are boring you will
never be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the
topperforming fund in the country you will never be able to boast that
you beat the market because the job of an index fund is to match the
markets return not to exceed it your indexfund manager is not likely
to roll the dice and gamble that the next great industry will be tele
portation  or  scratchnsniff  websites  or  telepathic  weightloss  clin
ics the fund will always own every stock not just one managers best
guess at the next new thing but as the years pass the cost advan
tage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly hold an index fund for
20 years or more adding new money every month and you are all but
certain  to  outperform  the  vast  majority  of  professional  and  individual
investors alike late in his life graham praised index funds as the best

when you add up all their handicaps the wonder is not that so few
funds beat the index but that any do and yet some do what quali
ties do they have in common

their  managers  are  the  biggest  shareholders the  conflict  of
interest between what is best for the funds managers and what is best
for  its  investors  is  mitigated  when  the  managers  are  among  the
biggest owners of the funds shares some firms like longleaf part
ners even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own
funds at longleaf and other firms like davis and fpa the managers
own so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money
as if it were their ownlowering the odds that they will jack up fees let
the funds swell to gargantuan size or whack you with a nasty tax bill a
funds proxy statement and statement of additional information both
available from the securities and exchange commission through the
edgar  database  at  wwwsecgov  disclose  whether  the  managers
own at least 1 of the funds shares

they are cheap one of the most common myths in the fund busi
ness is that you get what you pay forthat high returns are the best
justification  for  higher  fees  there  are  two  problems  with  this  argu
ment first it is not true decades of research have proven that funds
with higher fees earn lower returns over time secondly high returns
are temporary while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite if
you buy a fund for its hot returns you may well end up with a handful
of  cold  ashesbut  your  costs  of  owning  the  fund  are  almost  certain
not to decline when its returns do

they dare to be different when peter lynch ran fidelity magellan he
bought  whatever  seemed  cheap  to  himregardless  of  what  other  fund
managers owned in 1982 his biggest investment was treasury bonds
right  after  that  he  made  chrysler  his  top  holding  even  though  most
experts expected the automaker to go bankrupt then in 1986 lynch put
almost  20  of  fidelity  magellan  in  foreign  stocks  like  honda  norsk
hydro and volvo so before you buy a us stock fund compare the hold
ings listed in its latest report against the roster of the s  p 500 index if
they look like tweedledee and tweedledum shop for another fund7

they shut the door the best funds often close to new investors
permitting only their existing shareholders to buy more that stops the
feeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and pro
tects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis its also a signal
that  the  fund  managers  are  not  putting  their  own  wallets  ahead  of
yours  but  the  closing  should  occur  beforenot  afterthe  fund
explodes in size some companies with an exemplary record of shut
ting their own gates are longleaf numeric oakmark t rowe price
vanguard and wasatch

they do not advertise just as plato says in the republic that the ideal
rulers are those who do not want to govern the best fund managers often
behave as if they do not want your money they do not appear constantly on
financial television or run ads boasting of their no 1 returns the steady lit
tle mairs  power growth fund did not even have a website until 2001 and
still sells its shares in only 24 states the torray fund has never run a retail
advertisement since its launch in 1990

what  else  should  you  watch  for  most  fund  buyers  look  at  past
performance first then at the managers reputation then at the riski
ness of the fund and finally if ever at the funds expenses8

the intelligent investor looks at those same thingsbut in the oppo

site order

since a funds expenses are far more predictable than its future risk
or return you should make them your first filter there is no good rea
son ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses

must show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quar
ter if you cannot stand losing at least that much money in three months
go elsewhere its also worth checking a funds morningstar rating a
leading investment research firm morningstar awards star ratings to
funds  based  on  how  much  risk  they  took  to  earn  their  returns  one
star is the worst five is the best but just like past performance itself
these  ratings  look  back  in  time  they  tell  you  which  funds  were  the

a lowcost fund whose managers are major shareholders dare to be
different  do not  hype  their  returns  and  have  shown  a  willingness  to
shut  down  before  they  get  too  big  for  their  britches  then  and  only
then consult their morningstar rating10

finally look at past performance remembering that it is only a pale
predictor of future returns as we have already seen yesterdays winners
often  become  tomorrows  losers  but  researchers  have  shown  that
one thing is almost certain yesterdays losers almost never become
tomorrows  winners  so  avoid  funds  with  consistently  poor  past

not only tend to outperform those trading at a premium but are likely 
to  have  a  better  return  than  the  average  openend  mutual  fund 
sadly  however  diversified  closedend  stock  funds  are  not  always
available  at  a  discount  in  what  has  become  a  dusty  dwindling 
market11

but there are hundreds of closedend bond funds with especially
strong  choices  available  in  the  municipalbond  area  when  these
funds  trade  at  a  discount  their  yield  is  amplified  and  they  can  be
attractive so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds
listed above12

the  new  breed  of  exchangetraded  index  funds  can  be  worth
exploring  as  well  these  lowcost  etfs  sometimes  offer  the  only
means by which an investor can gain entree to a narrow market like
say companies  based  in  belgium  or  stocks  in  the  semiconductor
industry other index etfs offer much broader market exposure how
ever  they  are  generally  not  suitable  for  investors  who  wish  to  add
money  regularly  since  most  brokers  will  charge  a  separate  commis
sion on every new investment you make13

11 unlike  a  mutual  fund  a  closedend  fund  does  not  issue  new  shares
directly  to  anyone  who  wants  to  buy  them  instead  an  investor  must  buy
shares not from the fund itself but from another shareholder who is willing
to part with them thus the price of the shares fluctuates above and below
their net asset value depending on supply and demand

once  you  own  a  fund  how  can  you  tell  when  its  time  to  sell 
the standard advice is to ditch a fund if it underperforms the market
or  similar  portfolios  for  oneor  is  it  twoor  is  it  threeyears  in 
a  row  but  this  advice  makes  no  sense  from  its  birth  in  1970 
through  1999  the  sequoia  fund  underperformed  the  s    p  500
index  in  12  out  of  its  29  yearsor  more  than  41  of  the  time  yet
sequoia gained more than 12500 over that period versus 4900
for the index14

the performance of most funds falters simply because the type of
stocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor if you hired a manager
to invest in a particular way why fire him for doing what he promised
by selling when a style of investing is out of fashion you not only lock
in  a  loss  but  lock  yourself  out  of  the  allbutinevitable  recovery  one
study  showed  that  mutualfund  investors  underperformed  their  own
funds  by  47  percentage  points  annually  from  1998  through  2001
simply by buying high and selling low15

so when should you sell here a few definite red flags








a sharp and unexpected change in strategy such as a value
fund loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a growth fund
buying tons of insurance stocks in 2002
an increase in expenses suggesting that the managers are lin
ing their own pockets
large and frequent tax bills generated by excessive trading
suddenly erratic returns as when a formerly conservative fund
generates a big loss or even produces a giant gain

in  1999  money magazine  asked  more  than  500  people

in  late  1997  a  survey  of  750  investors  found  that  74
believed their mutualfund holdings would consistently beat
the  standard    poors  500  each  yeareven  though  most
funds fail to beat the s  p 500 in the long run and many fail
to beat it in any year1



while this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psy

chapter 10

the investor and his advisers

the investment of money in securities is unique among business
operations  in  that  it  is  almost  always  based  in  some  degree  on
advice received from others the great bulk of investors are ama
teurs naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can
profit by professional guidance yet there are peculiarities inherent
in the very concept of investment advice

if  the  reason  people  invest  is  to  make  money  then  in  seeking
advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money that
idea  has  some  element  of  naivete  businessmen  seek  professional
advice  on  various  elements  of  their  business  but  they  do  not
expect to be told how to make a profit that is their own bailiwick
when they or nonbusiness people rely on others to make invest
ment profits for them they are expecting a kind of result for which
there is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs

if we assume that there are normal or standard income results to
be obtained from investing money in securities then the role of the
adviser  can  be  more  readily  established  he  will  use  his  superior
training and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and
to make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is
entitled  it  is  when  the  investor  demands  more  than  an  average
return on his money or when his adviser undertakes to do better
for  him  that  the  question  arises  whether  more  is  being  asked  or
promised than is likely to be delivered

advice  on  investments  may  be  obtained  from  a  variety  of
sources these include 1 a relative or friend presumably knowl
edgeable in securities 2 a local commercial banker 3 a broker
age  firm  or  investment  banking  house  4  a  financial  service  or

257

the intelligent investor

periodical  and  5  an  investment  counselor  the  miscellaneous
character of this list suggests that no logical or systematic approach
in this matter has crystallized as yet in the minds of investors

certain  commonsense  considerations  relate  to  the  criterion  of
normal  or  standard  results  mentioned  above  our  basic  thesis  is
this if the investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in han
dling his funds then either he must limit himself and his advisers
strictly to standard conservative and even unimaginative forms of
investment or he must have an unusually intimate and favorable
knowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other
channels but if the ordinary business or professional relationship
exists between the investor and his advisers he can be receptive to
less conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has
grown  in  knowledge  and  experience  and  has  therefore  become
competent to pass independent judgment on the recommendations
of  others  he  has  then  passed  from  the  category  of  defensive  or
unenterprising  investor  into  that  of  aggressive  or  enterprising
investor

investment counsel and trust services of banks

the  truly  professional  investment  advisersthat  is  the  well
established  investment  counsel  firms  who  charge  substantial
annual  feesare  quite  modest  in  their  promises  and  pretentions
for the most part they place their clients funds in standard inter
est and dividendpaying securities and they rely mainly on nor
mal  investment  experience  for  their  overall  results  in  the  typical
case it is doubtful whether more than 10 of the total fund is ever
invested in securities other than those of leading companies plus

 the list of sources for investment advice remains as miscellaneous as it
was when graham wrote a survey of investors conducted in late 2002 for
the  securities  industry  association  a  wall  street  trade  group  found  that
17 of investors depended most heavily for investment advice on a spouse
or friend 2 on a banker 16 on a broker 10 on financial periodicals
and 24 on a financial planner the only difference from grahams day is
that  8  of  investors  now  rely  heavily  on  the  internet  and  3  on  financial
television see wwwsiacom

government bonds including state and municipal issues nor do
they make a serious effort to take advantage of swings in the gen
eral market

the  leading  investmentcounsel  firms  make  no  claim  to  being
brilliant they do pride themselves on being careful conservative
and  competent  their  primary  aim  is  to  conserve  the  principal
value over the years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate
of income any accomplishment beyond thatand they do strive
to  better  the  goalthey  regard  in  the  nature  of  extra  service  ren
dered  perhaps  their  chief  value  to  their  clients  lies  in  shielding
them  from  costly  mistakes  they  offer  as  much  as  the  defensive
investor  has  the  right  to  expect  from  any  counselor  serving  the
general public

what  we  have  said  about  the  wellestablished  investment
counsel firms applies generally to the trust and advisory services of
the larger banks

financial services

the socalled financial services are organizations that send out
uniform  bulletins  sometimes  in  the  form  of  telegrams  to  their
subscribers  the  subjects  covered  may  include  the  state  and
prospects  of  business  the  behavior  and  prospect  of  the  securities
markets and information and advice regarding individual issues
there  is  often  an  inquiry  department  which  will  answer  que
stons  affecting  an  individual  subscriber  the  cost  of  the  service
averages much less than the fee that investment counselors charge
their  individual  clients  some  organizationsnotably  babsons
and  standard    poorsoperate  on  separate  levels  as  a  financial
service  and  as  investment  counsel  incidentally  other  organiza

 the  character  of  investment  counseling  firms  and  trust  banks  has  not
changed  but  today  they  generally  do  not  offer  their  services  to  investors
with  less  than  1  million  in  financial  assets  in  some  cases  5  million  or
more  is  required  today  thousands  of  independent  financialplanning  firms
perform very similar functions although as analyst robert veres puts it the
mutual fund has replaced bluechip stocks as the investment of choice and
diversification has replaced quality as the standard of safety

the intelligent investor

tionssuch  as  scudder  stevens    clarkoperate  separately  as
investment counsel and as one or more investment funds

the financial services direct themselves on the whole to a quite
different  segment  of  the  public  than  do  the  investmentcounsel
firms  the  latters  clients  generally  wish  to  be  relieved  of  bother
and  the  need  for  making  decisions  the  financial  services  offer
information  and  guidance  to  those  who  are  directing  their  own
financial  affairs  or  are  themselves  advising  others  many  of  these
services confine themselves exclusively or nearly so to forecasting
market movements by various technical methods we shall dis
miss these with the observation that their work does not concern
investors as the term is used in this book

on the other hand some of the best knownsuch as moodys
investment  service  and  standard    poorsare  identified  with
statistical  organizations  that  compile  the  voluminous  statistical
data that form the basis for all serious security analysis these ser
vices have a varied clientele ranging from the most conservative
minded  investor  to  the  rankest  speculator as  a  result  they  must
find it difficult to adhere to any clearcut or fundamental philoso
phy in arriving at their opinions and recommendations

an oldestablished service of the type of moodys and the others
must obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of
investors what is it basically they address themselves to the mat
ters  in  which  the  average  active  investorspeculator  is  interested
and their views on these either command some measure of author
ity or at least appear more reliable than those of the unaided client
for years the financial services have been making stockmarket
forecasts  without  anyone  taking  this  activity  very  seriously  like
everyone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes
wrong wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid
the  risk  of  being  proved  completely  wrong  there  is  a  well
developed art of delphic phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to
whatever  the  future  brings  in  our  viewperhaps  a  prejudiced
onethis segment of their work has no real significance except for
the  light  it  throws  on  human  nature  in  the  securities  markets
nearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by
someone  else  what  he  thinks  the  market  is  going  to  do  the
demand being there it must be supplied

their  interpretations  and  forecasts  of  business  conditions  of

course are much more authoritative and informing these are an
important part of the great body of economic intelligence which is
spread  continuously  among  buyers  and  sellers  of  securities  and
tends  to  create  fairly  rational  prices  for  stocks  and  bonds  under
most  circumstances  undoubtedly  the  material  published  by  the
financial services adds to the store of information available and for
tifies the investment judgment of their clients

it  is  difficult  to  evaluate  their  recommendations  of  individual
securities each service is entitled to be judged separately and the
verdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive
study covering many years in our own experience we have noted
among them a pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair
what could otherwise be more useful advisory work this is their
general  view  that  a  stock  should  be  bought  if  the  nearterm
prospects of the business are favorable and should be sold if these
are  unfavorableregardless  of  the  current  price such  a  superficial
principle often prevents the services from doing the sound analyti
cal  job  of  which  their  staffs  are  capablenamely  to  ascertain
whether a given stock appears over or undervalued at the current
price in the light of its indicated longterm future earning power

the intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on
the basis of recommendations received from a financial service once
this point is established the role of the financial service then becomes
the useful one of supplying information and offering suggestions

advice from brokerage houses

probably  the  largest  volume  of  information  and  advice  to  the
securityowning public comes from stockbrokers these are mem
bers  of  the  new  york  stock  exchange  and  of  other  exchanges 
who execute buying and selling orders for a standard commission
practically  all  the  houses  that  deal  with  the  public  maintain  a 
statistical  or  analytical  department  which  answers  inquiries 
and makes recommendations a great deal of analytical literature
some  of  it  elaborate  and  expensive  is  distributed  gratis  to  the
firms customersmore impressively referred to as clients

a great  deal  is  at  stake  in  the  innocentappearing  question
whether customers or clients is the more appropriate name a
business has customers a professional person or organization has

the intelligent investor

clients the wall street brokerage fraternity has probably the high
est  ethical  standards  of  any  business but  it  is  still  feeling  its  way
toward the standards and standing of a true profession

in  the  past  wall  street  has  thrived  mainly  on  speculation  and
stockmarket  speculators  as  a  class  were  almost  certain  to  lose
money  hence  it  has  been  logically  impossible  for  brokerage
houses  to  operate  on  a  thoroughly  professional  basis  to  do  that
would have required them to direct their efforts toward reducing
rather than increasing their business

the  farthest  that  certain  brokerage  houses  have  gone  in  that
directionand could have been expected to gois to refrain from
inducing  or  encouraging  anyone  to  speculate  such  houses  have
confined themselves to executing orders given them to supplying
financial  information  and  analyses  and  to  rendering  opinions  on
the investment merits of securities thus in theory at least they are
devoid  of  all  responsibility  for  either  the  profits  or  the  losses  of
their speculative customers

most  stockexchange  houses  however  still  adhere  to  the  old
time  slogans  that  they  are  in  business  to  make  commissions  and
that the way to succeed in business is to give the customers what
they  want  since  the  most  profitable  customers  want  speculative
advice  and  suggestions  the  thinking  and  activities  of  the  typical
firm are pretty closely geared to daytoday trading in the market
thus  it  tries  hard  to  help  its  customers  make  money  in  a  field
where they are condemned almost by mathematical law to lose in
the end by this we mean that the speculative part of their opera
tions  cannot  be  profitable  over  the  long  run  for  most  brokerage

 overall graham was as tough and cynical an observer as wall street has
ever seen in this rare case however he was not nearly cynical enough wall
street  may  have  higher  ethical  standards  than  some businesses  smug
gling  prostitution  congressional  lobbying  and  journalism  come  to  mind
but  the  investment  world  nevertheless  has  enough  liars  cheaters  and
thieves to keep satans checkin clerks frantically busy for decades to come
 the thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the belief
that wall street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable advice have
learned in a painful way how right graham is on this point
 interestingly this stinging criticism which in his day graham was directing
at fullservice brokers ended up applying to discount internet brokers in the

house  customers  but  to  the  extent  that  their  operations  resemble
true investing they may produce investment gains that more than
offset the speculative losses

the  investor  obtains  advice  and  information  from  stock
exchange  houses  through  two  types  of  employees  now  known
officially  as  customers  brokers  or  account  executives  and
financial analysts

the customers broker also called a registered representative
formerly  bore  the  less  dignified  title  of  customers  man  today
he is for the most part an individual of good character and consid
erable knowledge of securities who operates under a rigid code of
right conduct nevertheless since his business is to earn commis
sions  he  can  hardly  avoid  being  speculationminded  thus  the
security buyer who wants to avoid being influenced by speculative
considerations will ordinarily have to be careful and explicit in his
dealing with his customers broker he will have to show clearly by
word and deed that he is not interested in anything faintly resem
bling  a  stockmarket  tip  once  the  customers  broker  under
stands  clearly  that  he  has  a  real  investor  on  his  hands  he  will
respect this point of view and cooperate with it

the  financial  analyst  formerly  known  chiefly  as  security  ana
lyst is a person of particular concern to the author who has been
one  himself  for  more  than  five  decades  and  has  helped  educate
countless  others at  this  stage  we  refer  only  to  the  financial  ana
lysts employed by brokerage houses the function of the security
analyst  is  clear  enough  from  his  title  it  is  he  who  works  up  the
detailed studies of individual securities develops careful compar
isons of various issues in the same field and forms an expert opin
ion  of  the  safety  or  attractiveness  or  intrinsic  value  of  all  the
different kinds of stocks and bonds

late 1990s these firms spent millions of dollars on flashy advertising that
goaded their customers into trading more and trading faster most of those
customers ended up picking their own pockets instead of paying someone
else to do it for themand the cheap commissions on that kind of transac
tion are a poor consolation for the result more traditional brokerage firms
meanwhile  began  emphasizing  financial  planning  and  integrated  asset
management  instead  of  compensating  their  brokers  only  on  the  basis  of
how many commissions they could generate

the intelligent investor

by what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal
requirements  for  being  a  security  analyst  contrast  with  this  the
facts that a customers broker must pass an examination meet the
required  character  tests  and  be  duly  accepted  and  registered  by
the new york stock exchange as a practical matter nearly all the
younger analysts have had extensive businessschool training and
the oldsters have acquired at least the equivalent in the school of
long experience in the great majority of cases the employing bro
kerage house can be counted on to assure itself of the qualifications
and competence of its analysts

the customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security
analysts directly or his contact may be an indirect one via the cus
tomers broker in either case the analyst is available to the client
for a considerable amount of information and advice let us make
an emphatic statement here the value of the security analyst to the
investor  depends  largely  on  the  investors  own  attitude  if  the
investor  asks  the  analyst  the  right  questions  he  is  likely  to  get 
the  rightor  at  least  valuableanswers  the  analysts  hired  by
brokerage  houses  we  are  convinced  are  greatly  handicapped  by
the general feeling that they are supposed to be market analysts as
well  when  they  are  asked  whether  a  given  common  stock  is
sound the question often means is this stock likely to advance
during the next few months as a result many of them are com

 this  remains  true  although  many  of wall  streets  best  analysts  hold  the
title of chartered financial analyst the cfa certification is awarded by the
association of investment management  research formerly the financial

worldwide have been certified as cfas sadly a recent survey by professor

pelled to analyze with one eye on the stock tickera pose not con
ducive to sound thinking or worthwhile conclusions

in the next section of this book we shall deal with some of the con
cepts and possible achievements of security analysis a great many
analysts  working  for  stock  exchange  firms  could  be  of  prime  assis
tance to the bona fide investor who wants to be sure that he gets full
value for his money and possibly a little more as in the case of the
customers brokers what is needed at the beginning is a clear under
standing by the analyst of the investors attitude and objectives once
the analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is value
minded  rather  than  quotationminded  there  is  an  excellent  chance
that his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit

the cfa certificate for financial analysts

an important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional
standing and responsibility to financial analysts the official title of
chartered  financial  analyst  cfa  is  now  awarded  to  those  senior
practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests
of fitness1 the subjects covered include security analysis and port
folio  management  the  analogy  with  the  longestablished  profes
sional  title  of  certified  public  accountant  cpa  is  evident  and
intentional this relatively new apparatus of recognition and con
trol should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and
eventually to place their work on a truly professional basis

 it is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere commoners to
contact him directly for the most part only the nobility of institutional investors
are permitted to approach the throne of the almighty wall street analyst an indi
vidual  investor  might  perhaps  have  some  luck  calling  analysts  who  work  at
regional brokerage firms headquartered outside of new york city the investor
relations area at the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a
list  of  analysts  who  follow  the  stock  websites  like  wwwzackscom  and
wwwmultexcom offer access to analysts research reportsbut the intelligent
investor  should  remember  that  most  analysts  do  not  analyze  businesses
instead they engage in guesswork about future stock prices

program which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became a reality

dealings with brokerage houses

one  of  the  most  disquieting  developments  of  the  period  in
which  we  write  this  revision  has  been  the  financial  embarrass
mentin plain words bankruptcy or nearbankruptcyof quite a
few new york stock exchange firms including at least two of con
siderable size this is the first time in half a century or more that
such  a  thing  has  happened  and  it  is  startling  for  more  than  one
reason for many decades the new york stock exchange has been
moving  in  the  direction  of  closer  and  stricter  controls  over  the
operations and financial condition of its membersincluding min
imum  capital  requirements  surprise  audits  and  the  like  besides
this we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their
members  by  the  securities  and  exchange  commission  finally 
the  stockbrokerage  industry  itself  has  operated  under  favorable
conditionsnamely  a  huge  increase  in  volume  fixed  minimum
commission rates largely eliminating competitive fees and a lim
ited number of member firms

the  first  financial  troubles  of  the  brokerage  houses  in  1969
were  attributed  to  the  increase  in  volume  itself  this  it  was
claimed  overtaxed  their  facilities  increased  their  overhead  and
produced many troubles in making financial settlements it should
be  pointed  out  this  was  probably  the  first  time  in  history  that
important  enterprises  have  gone  broke  because  they  had  more
business  than  they  could  handle  in  1970  as  brokerage  failures
increased they were blamed chiefly on the falling off in volume
a strange  complaint  when  one  reflects  that  the  turnover  of  the

 the two firms graham had in mind were probably du pont glore forgan
 co and goodbody  co du pont founded by the heirs to the chemical
fortune  was  saved  from  insolvency  in  1970  only  after  texas  entrepreneur 
h ross perot lent more than 50 million to the firm goodbody the fifth
largest brokerage firm in the united states would have failed in late 1970
had  merrill  lynch  not  acquired  it  hayden  stone    co  would  also  have
gone under if it had not been acquired in 1970 no fewer than seven bro
kerage  firms  went  bust  the  farcical  story  of  wall  streets  frenzied  over
expansion in the late 1960s is beautifully told in john brookss the gogo

nyse in 1970 totaled 2937 million shares the largest volume in its
history  and  well  over  twice  as  large  as  in  any  year  before  1965
during the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual
volume  had  averaged  only  712  million  sharesone  quarter  of
the 1970 figurebut the brokerage business had enjoyed the great
est prosperity in its history if as it appears the member firms as a
whole had allowed their overhead and other expenses to increase
at  a  rate  that  could  not  sustain  even  a  mild  reduction  in  volume
during part of a year this does not speak well for either their busi
ness acumen or their financial conservatism

a third explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out
of a mist of concealment and we suspect that it is the most plausi
ble and significant of the three it seems that a good part of the cap
ital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common
stocks  owned  by  the  individual  partners  some  of  these  seem  to
have been highly speculative and carried at inflated values when
the  market  declined  in  1969  the  quotations  of  such  securities  fell
drastically  and  a  substantial  part  of  the  capital  of  the  firms  van
ished with them2 in effect the partners were speculating with the
capital  that  was  supposed  to  protect  the  customers  against  the
ordinary  financial  hazards  of  the  brokerage  business  in  order  to
make  a  double  profit  thereon  this  was  inexcusable  we  refrain
from saying more

the investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating
his  financial  policies  but  also  in  the  associated  details  these
include the choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders up to
now  it  was  sufficient  to  counsel  our  readers  to  deal  only  with  a
member  of  the  new  york  stock  exchange  unless  he  had  com
pelling  reasons  to  use  a  nonmember  firm  reluctantly  we  must
add some further advice in this area we think that people who do
not  carry  margin  accountsand  in  our  vocabulary  this  means all
nonprofessional investorsshould have the delivery and receipt of
their securities handled by their bank when giving a buying order
to  your  brokers  you  can  instruct  them  to  deliver  the  securities
bought  to  your  bank  against  payment  therefor  by  the  bank  con
versely  when  selling  you  can  instruct  your  bank  to  deliver  the
securities to the broker against payment of the proceeds these ser
vices  will  cost  a  little  extra  but  they  should  be  well  worth  the
expense in terms of safety and peace of mind this advice may be

268

the intelligent investor

disregarded as no longer called for after the investor is sure that
all  the  problems  of  stockexchange  firms  have  been  disposed  of
but not before

investment bankers

the term investment banker is applied to a firm that engages
to  an  important  extent  in  originating  underwriting  and  selling
new issues of stocks and bonds to underwrite means to guaran
tee to the issuing corporation or other issuer that the security will
be fully sold a number of the brokerage houses carry on a certain
amount of underwriting activity generally this is confined to par
ticipating  in  underwriting  groups  formed  by  leading  investment
bankers  there  is  an  additional  tendency  for  brokerage  firms  to
originate and sponsor a minor amount of newissue financing par
ticularly  in  the  form  of  smaller  issues  of  common  stocks  when  a
bull market is in full swing

investment banking is perhaps the most respectable department
of the wall street community because it is here that finance plays
its constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of
industry in fact much of the theoretical justification for maintain
ing  active  stock  markets  notwithstanding  their  frequent  specula
tive  excesses  lies  in  the  fact  that  organized  security  exchanges
facilitate the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks if investors or
speculators could not expect to see a ready market for a new secu
rity offered them they might well refuse to buy it

the  relationship  between  the  investment  banker  and  the

 nearly  all  brokerage  transactions  are  now  conducted  electronically  and
securities are no longer physically delivered thanks to the establishment
of  the  securities  investor  protection  corporation  or  sipc  in  1970
investors are generally assured of recovering their full account values if their
brokerage firm becomes insolvent sipc is a governmentmandated consor
tium of brokers all the members agree to pool their assets to cover losses
incurred by the customers of any firm that becomes insolvent sipcs pro
tection eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary as graham urges

the investor and his advisers

269

investor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer
for many years past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar
value has consisted of bond issues that were purchased in the main
by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies in
this business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd
and experienced buyers hence any recommendations made by the
investment  bankers  to  these  customers  have  had  to  pass  careful
and  skeptical  scrutiny  thus  these  transactions  are  almost  always
effected on a businesslike footing

but  a  different  situation  obtains  in  a  relationship  between  the
individual security buyer and the investment banking firms includ
ing the stockbrokers acting as underwriters here the purchaser is
frequently  inexperienced  and  seldom  shrewd  he  is  easily  influ
enced  by  what  the  salesman  tells  him  especially  in  the  case  of 
commonstock issues since often his unconfessed desire in buying
is  chiefly  to  make  a  quick  profit  the  effect  of  all  this  is  that  the
public investors protection lies less in his own critical faculty than
in the scruples and ethics of the offering houses3

it is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting
firms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles
of adviser and salesman but it is imprudent for the buyer to trust
himself  to  the  judgment  of  the  seller  in  1959  we  stated  at  this 
point the bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves
recurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the
sale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula
tion shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed as
already  pointed  out  the  years  196061  and  again  196869  were
marked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual
ity sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many
cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi
manipulation a number of the more important wall street houses
have participated to some degree in these less than creditable activ
ities  which  demonstrates  that  the  familiar  combination  of  greed
folly and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the financial
scene

the intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and rec
ommendations  received  from  investment  banking  houses  espe
cially those known by him to have an excellent reputation but he
will  be  sure  to  bring  sound  and  independent  judgment  to  bear

270

the intelligent investor

upon these suggestionseither his own if he is competent or that
of some other type of adviser

other advisers

it is a good old custom especially in the smaller towns to con
sult  ones  local  banker  about  investments  a commercial  banker
may  not  be  a  thoroughgoing  expert  on  security  values  but  he  is
experienced  and  conservative  he  is  especially  useful  to  the
unskilled investor who is often tempted to stray from the straight
and unexciting path of a defensive policy and needs the steadying
influence  of  a  prudent  mind  the  more  alert  and  aggressive
investor seeking counsel in the selection of security bargains will
not ordinarily find the commercial bankers viewpoint to be espe
cially suited to his own objectives

we take a more critical attitude toward the widespread custom
of asking investment advice from relatives or friends the inquirer
always  thinks  he  has  good  reason  for  assuming  that  the  person
consulted has superior knowledge or experience our own obser
vation indicates that it is almost as difficult to select satisfactory lay
advisers as it is to select the proper securities unaided much bad
advice is given free

summary

investors who are prepared to pay a fee for the management of
their  funds  may  wisely  select  some  wellestablished  and  well
recommended  investmentcounsel  firm  alternatively  they  may
use  the  investment  department  of  a  large  trust  company  or  the
supervisory service supplied on a fee basis by a few of the leading
new york stock exchange houses the results to be expected are in
no wise exceptional but they are commensurate with those of the
average wellinformed and cautious investor

 those who heeded grahams advice would not have been suckered into
buying internet ipos in 1999 and 2000
 this traditional role of bankers has for the most part been supplanted by
accountants lawyers or financial planners

the investor and his advisers

271

most security buyers obtain advice without paying for it specifi
cally it stands to reason therefore that in the majority of cases they
are not entitled to and should not expect better than average results
they should be wary of all persons whether customers brokers or
security salesmen who promise spectacular income or profits this
applies both to the selection of securities and to guidance in the elu
sive and perhaps illusive art of trading in the market

defensive  investors  as  we  have  defined  them  will  not  ordi
narily be equipped to pass independent judgment on the security
recommendations  made  by  their  advisers  but  they  can  be
explicitand even repetitiously soin stating the kind of securi
ties they want to buy if they follow our prescription they will con
fine  themselves  to  highgrade  bonds  and  the  common  stocks  of
leading  corporations  preferably  those  that  can  be  purchased  at
individual price levels that are not high in the light of experience
and analysis the security analyst of any reputable stockexchange
house can make up a suitable list of such common stocks and can
certify to the investor whether or not the existing price level there
for is a reasonably conservative one as judged by past experience

the aggressive investor will ordinarily work in active coopera
tion  with  his  advisers  he  will  want  their  recommendations
explained in detail and he will insist on passing his own judgment
upon them this means that the investor will gear his expectations
and the character of his security operations to the development of
his own knowledge and experience in the field only in the excep
tional  case  where  the  integrity  and  competence  of  the  advisers
have been thoroughly demonstrated should the investor act upon
the  advice  of  others  without  understanding  and  approving  the
decision made

there  have  always  been  unprincipled  stock  salesmen  and  fly
bynight  stock  brokers  andas  a  matter  of  coursewe  have
advised our readers to confine their dealings if possible to mem
bers of the new york stock exchange but we are reluctantly com
pelled  to  add  the  extracautious  counsel  that  security  deliveries
and payments be made through the intermediary of the investors
bank  the  distressing  wall  street  brokeragehouse  picture  may
have cleared up completely in a few years but in late 1971 we still
suggest better safe than sorry

in the glory days of the late 1990s many investors chose to go it alone
by doing their own research picking stocks themselves and placing
their trades through an online broker these investors bypassed wall
streets costly infrastructure of research advice and trading unfortu
nately many doityourselfers asserted their independence right before
the worst bear market since the great depressionmaking them feel
in the end that they were fools for going it alone that is not necessar
ily true of course people who delegated every decision to a traditional
stockbroker lost money too

but many investors do take comfort from the experience judgment
and second opinion that a good financial adviser can provide some
investors may need an outsider to show them what rate of return they
need  to  earn  on  their  investments  or  how  much  extra  money  they
need to save in order to meet their financial goals others may simply
benefit from having someone else to blame when their investments go
down  that  way  instead  of  beating  yourself  up  in  an  agony  of  self
doubt you get to criticize someone who typically can defend him or
herself and encourage you at the same time that may provide just the
psychological  boost  you  need  to  keep  investing  steadily  at  a  time

when other investors hearts may fail them all in all just as there is no
reason you cannot manage your own portfolio so there is no shame in
seeking professional help in managing it1

how can you tell if you need a hand here are some signals
big losses if your portfolio lost more than 40 of its value from
the  beginning  of  2000  through  the  end  of  2002  then  you  did  even
worse than the dismal performance of the stock market itself it hardly
matters  whether  you  blew  it  by  being  lazy  reckless  or  just  unlucky
after such a giant loss your portfolio is crying out for help

busted  budgets if  you  perennially  struggle  to  make  ends  meet
have no idea where your money goes find it impossible to save on a
regular  schedule  and  chronically  fail  to  pay  your  bills  on  time  then
your finances are out of control an adviser can help you get a grip on
your money by designing a comprehensive financial plan that will out
line howand how muchyou should spend borrow save and invest
chaotic portfolios all too many investors thought they were diver
sified  in  the  late  1990s  because  they  owned  39  different  internet
stocks  or  seven  different  us  growthstock  funds  but  that is  like
thinking  that  an  allsoprano  chorus  can  handle  singing  old  man
river better than a soprano soloist can no matter how many sopra

until some baritones join the group likewise if all your holdings go up

cation brings a professional assetallocation plan can help

up a retirement plan your aging parents do not have their finances in
order or college for your kids looks unaffordable an adviser can not
only provide peace of mind but help you make genuine improvements
in  the  quality  of  your  life  what is  more  a  qualified  professional  can
ensure that you benefit from and comply with the staggering complex
ity of the tax laws and retirement rules

your financial future in the hands of an adviser its imperative that you
find someone who not only makes you comfortable but whose honesty
is beyond reproach as ronald reagan used to say trust then ver
ify start off by thinking of the handful of people you know best and
trust the most then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom they
trust  and  who  they  feel  delivers  good  value  for  his  fees  a  vote  of
confidence from someone you admire is a good start2

once you have the name of the adviser and his firm as well as his
specialtyis  he  a  stockbroker  financial  planner  accountant  insur
ance agentyou can begin your due diligence enter the name of the
adviser and his or her firm into an internet search engine like google
to  see  if  anything  comes  up  watch  for  terms  like  fine  complaint
lawsuit  disciplinary  action  or  suspension  if  the  adviser  is  a
stockbroker  or  insurance  agent  contact  the  office  of  your  states
securities  commissioner  a  convenient  directory  of  online  links  is  at
wwwnasaaorg to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer
complaints have been filed against the adviser3 if you are considering
an accountant who also functions as a financial adviser your states
accounting regulators whom you can find through the national asso
ciation  of  state  boards  of  accountancy  at  wwwnasbaorg  will  tell
you whether his or her record is clean

financial planners or their firms must register with either the us
securities  and  exchange  commission  or  securities  regulators  in  the
state  where  their  practice  is  based  as  part  of  that  registration  the 
adviser must file a twopart document called form adv you should be
able  to  view  and  download  it  at  wwwadvisorinfosecgov  wwwiard
com  or  the  website  of  your  state  securities  regulator  pay  special 
attention to the disclosure reporting pages where the adviser must
disclose  any  disciplinary  actions  by  regulators  because  unscrupu

to find a feeonly financial planner through wwwnapfaorg or wwwfeeonly
org  whose  members  are  generally  held  to  high  standards  of  service  and
integrity
3 by itself a customer complaint is not enough to disqualify an adviser from
your consideration but a persistent pattern of complaints is and a discipli
nary  action  by  state  or  federal  regulators  usually  tells  you  to  find  another

commentary on chapter 10

g e t t i n g   t o   k n o w   y o you

a leading financialplanning newsletter recently canvassed dozens of
advisers to get their thoughts on how you should go about interview
ing them4 in screening an adviser your goals should be to







determine whether he or she cares about helping clients or just
goes through the motions
establish whether he or she understands the fundamental princi
ples of investing as they are outlined in this book
assess  whether  he  or  she  is  sufficiently  educated  trained  and
experienced to help you

here  are  some  of  the  questions  that  prominent  financial  planners

recommended any prospective client should ask

why are you in this business what is the mission statement of your
firm besides your alarm clock what makes you get up in the morning
what  is  your  investing  philosophy  do  you  use  stocks  or  mutual
funds do you use technical analysis do you use market timing a
yes to either of the last two questions is a no signal to you

do you focus solely on asset management or do you also advise
on taxes estate and retirement planning budgeting and debt manage
ment  and  insurance  how  do  your  education  experience  and  cre
dentials qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice 5

what  needs  do  your  clients  typically  have  in  common  how  can
you  help  me  achieve  my  goals  how  will  you  track  and  report  my
progress  do  you  provide  a  checklist  that  i  can  use  to  monitor  the
implementation of any financial plan we develop

4 robert  veres  editor  and  publisher  of  the  inside  information newsletter
generously shared these responses for this book other checklists of ques
tions can be found at wwwcfpboardorg and wwwnapfaorg
5 credentials like the cfa cfp or cpa tell you that the adviser has taken
and passed a rigorous course of study most of the other alphabet soup
of credentials brandished by financial planners including the cfm or the
cmfc signify very little more important by contacting the organization
that awards the credential you can verify his record and check that he has
not been disciplined for violations of rules or ethics

how do you choose investments what investing approach do you
believe is most successful and what evidence can you show me that
you have achieved that kind of success for your clients what do you
do  when  an  investment  performs  poorly  for  an  entire  year  any
adviser who answers sell is not worth hiring

do you when recommending investments accept any form of com
pensation from any third party why or why not under which circum
stances how much in actual dollars do you estimate i would pay for
your services the first year what would make that number go up or
down over time if fees will consume more than 1 of your assets
annually you should probably shop for another adviser6

how many clients do you have and how often do you communicate
with  them  what  has  been  your  proudest  achievement  for  a  client
what characteristics do your favorite clients share what is the worst
experience you have had with a client and how did you resolve it what
determines  whether  a  client  speaks  to  you  or  to  your  support  staff
how long do clients typically stay with you

can i see a sample account statement if you cannot understand it
ask  the  adviser  to  explain  it  if  you  cannot  understand  his  explanation
hes not right for you

do you consider yourself financially successful why how do you

define financial success

how high an average annual return do you think is feasible on my

investments anything over 8 to10 is unrealistic

will you provide me with your resume your form adv and at least
three references if the adviser or his firm is required to file an adv
and he will not provide you a copy get up and leaveand keep one
hand on your wallet as you go

have you ever had a formal complaint filed against you why did

the last client who fired you do so

6 if  you  have  less  than  100000  to  invest  you  may  not  be  able  to  find  a
financial adviser who will take your account in that case buy a diversified
basket of lowcost index funds follow the behavioral advice throughout this
book and your portfolio should eventually grow to the level at which you can
afford an adviser

278

commentary on chapter 10

d e f e a t i n g   y o you are   o w n   w o r s t   e n e m y

finally bear in mind that great financial advisers do not grow on trees
often the best already have as many clients as they can handleand
may be willing to take you on only if you seem like a good match so
they will ask you some tough questions as well which might include

why do you feel you need a financial adviser
what are your longterm goals
what has been your greatest frustration in dealing with other advis

ers including yourself

do you have a budget do you live within your means what per

centage of your assets do you spend each year

when  we  look  back  a  year  from  now  what  will  i  need  to  have

accomplished in order for you to be happy with your progress

how do you handle conflicts or disagreements
how did you respond emotionally to the bear market that began in

2000

what are your worst financial fears your greatest financial hopes
what  rate  of  return  on  your  investments  do  you  consider  reason

able base your answer on chapter 3

an  adviser  who  does not  ask  questions  like  theseand  who  does
not show enough interest in you to sense intuitively what other ques
tions you consider to be the right onesis not a good fit

above all else you should trust your adviser enough to permit him
or  her  to  protect  you  from  your  worst  enemyyourself  you  hire  an
adviser  explains  commentator  nick  murray  not  to  manage  money
but to manage you

if  the  adviser  is  a  line  of  defense  between  you  and  your  worst
impulsive  tendencies  says  financialplanning  analyst  robert  veres
then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of
you control them among those systems







a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn
save spend borrow and invest your money
an investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental
approach to investing
an assetallocation  plan that  details  how  much  money  you  will
keep in different investment categories

security analysis for the lay investor 

general approach

financial analysis is now a wellestablished and flourishing pro
fession  or  semiprofession  the  various  societies  of  analysts  that
make up the national federation of financial analysts have over
13000  members  most  of  whom  make  their  living  out  of  this
branch of mental activity financial analysts have textbooks a code
of  ethics  and  a  quarterly  journal  they  also  have  their  share  of
unresolved problems in recent years there has been a tendency to
replace the general concept of security analysis by that of finan
cial  analysis  the  latter  phrase  has  a  broader  implication  and  is
better suited to describe the work of most senior analysts on wall
street  it  would  be  useful  to  think  of  security  analysis  as  limiting
itself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and
bonds whereas financial analysis would comprise that work plus
the determination of investment policy portfolio selection plus a
substantial  amount  of  general  economic  analysis1 in  this  chapter
we  shall  use  whatever  designation  is  most  applicable  with  chief
emphasis on the work of the security analyst proper

the  security  analyst  deals  with  the  past  the  present  and  the
future  of  any  given  security  issue  he  describes  the  business  he
summarizes  its  operating  results  and  financial  position  he  sets
forth its strong and weak points its possibilities and risks he esti
mates its future earning power under various assumptions or as a

 the  national  federation  of  financial  analysts  is  now  the  association  for
investment management and research its quarterly research publication
the financial analysts journal now appears every other month

best guess he makes elaborate comparisons of various compa
nies or of the same company at various times finally he expresses
an opinion as to the safety of the issue if it is a bond or investment
grade preferred stock or as to its attractiveness as a purchase if it
is a common stock

in doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a
number  of  techniques  ranging  from  the  elementary  to  the  most
abstruse  he  may  modify  substantially  the  figures 
in  the
companys  annual  statements  even  though  they  bear  the  sacred
imprimatur of the certified public accountant he is on the lookout
particularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal
more or less than they say

the security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by
which  we  can  conclude  whether  a  given  bond  or  preferred  stock
may  be  termed  sound  enough  to  justify  purchase  for  investment
these standards relate primarily to past average earnings but they
are  concerned  also  with  capital  structure  working  capital  asset
values and other matters

in  dealing  with  common  stocks  the  security  analyst  until
recently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined
as  were  his  standards  of  safety  for  bonds  and  preferred  stocks
most of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per
formances a more or less general forecast of the futurewith par
ticular  emphasis  on  the  next  12  monthsand  a  rather  arbitrary
conclusion the latter was and still is often drawn with one eye on
the  stock  ticker  or  the  market  charts  in  the  past  few  years  how
ever  much  attention  has  been  given  by  practicing  analysts  to  the
problem of valuing growth stocks many of these have sold at such
high prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec
ommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur
chase  by  fairly  definite  projections  of  expected  earnings  running
fairly  far  into  the  future  certain  mathematical  techniques  of  a
rather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the
valuations arrived at

we shall deal with these techniques in foreshortened form a lit
tle later however we must point out a troublesome paradox here
which  is  that  the  mathematical  valuations  have  become  most
prevalent precisely in those areas where one might consider them
least  reliable  for  the  more  dependent  the  valuation  becomes  on

282

the intelligent investor

anticipations  of  the  futureand  the  less  it  is  tied  to  a  figure
demonstrated  by  past  performancethe  more  vulnerable  it
becomes to possible miscalculation and serious error a large part
of  the  value  found  for  a  highmultiplier  growth  stock  is  derived
from  future  projections  which  differ  markedly  from  past  perfor
manceexcept  perhaps  in  the  growth  rate  itself  thus  it  may  be
said  that  security  analysts  today  find  themselves  compelled  to
become  most  mathematical  and  scientific  in  the  very  situations
which lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment

let  us  proceed  nonetheless  with  our  discussion  of  the  more
important elements and techniques of security analysis the pres
ent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non
professional investor at the minimum he should understand what
the security analyst is talking about and driving at beyond that he
should be equipped if possible to distinguish between superficial
and sound analysis

security analysis for the lay investor is thought of as beginning

 the  higher  the  growth  rate  you  project  and  the  longer  the  future  period
over which you project it the more sensitive your forecast becomes to the
slightest error if for instance you estimate that a company earning 1 per
share can raise that profit by 15 a year for the next 15 years its earnings
would end up at 814 if the market values the company at 35 times earn
ings the stock would finish the period at roughly 285 but if earnings grow
at 14 instead of 15 the company would earn 714 at the end of the
periodand in the shock of that shortfall investors would no longer be will
ing  to  pay  35  times  earnings  at  say  20  times  earnings  the  stock  would
end up around 140 per share or more than 50 less because advanced
mathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process
of foreseeing the future investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who
claims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems
as graham put it in 44 years of wall street experience and study i have
never seen dependable calculations made about commonstock values or
related investment policies that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra whenever calculus is brought in or higher algebra you
could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute
theory for experience and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive
guise of investment see p 570

with the interpretation of a companys annual financial report this
is a subject which we have covered for laymen in a separate book
entitled the  interpretation  of  financial  statements2 we do  not  con
sider  it  necessary  or  appropriate  to  traverse  the  same  ground  in
this chapter especially since the emphasis in the present book is on
principles  and  attitudes  rather  than  on  information  and  descrip
tion let us pass on to two basic questions underlying the selection
of investments what are the primary tests of safety of a corporate
bond  or  preferred  stock  what  are  the  chief  factors  entering  into
the valuation of a common stock

bond analysis

the most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of
security analysis concerns itself with the safety or quality of bond
issues  and  investmentgrade  preferred  stocks  the  chief  criterion
used for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest
charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in
the past in the case of preferred stocks it is the number of times
that  bond  interest  and  preferred  dividends  combined  have  been
covered

the exact standards applied will vary with different authorities
since the tests are at bottom arbitrary there is no way to determine
precisely the most suitable criteria in the 1961 revision of our text
book security  analysis we  recommend  certain  coverage  stan
dards which appear in table 111

our basic test is applied only to the average results for a period
of years other authorities require also that a minimum coverage be
shown for every year considered we approve a poorestyear test

 in 1972 an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to assemble
his or her own portfolio today roughly 500 mutual funds invest in corporate
bonds creating a convenient welldiversified bundle of securities since it is
not  feasible  to  build  a  diversified  bond  portfolio  on  your  own  unless  you
have at least 100000 the typical intelligent investor will be best off simply
buying  a  lowcost  bond  fund  and  leaving  the  painstaking  labor  of  credit
research to its managers for more on bond funds see the commentary on
chapter 4

b for investmentgrade preferred stocks

the same minimum figures as above are required to be shown by the
ratio  of  earnings  before income  taxes  to  the  sum  of  fixed  charges  plus
twice preferred dividends

note the inclusion of twice the preferred dividends allows for the fact
that preferred dividends are not incometax deductible whereas
interest charges are so deductible

c other categories of bonds and preferreds

the standards given above are not applicable to 1 publicutility hold
ing  companies  2  financial  companies  3  realestate  companies
requirements for these special groups are omitted here

as  an  alternative to  the  sevenyearaverage  test  it  would  be  suffi
cient if the bond or preferred stock met either of these criteria

it may be objected that the large increase in bond interest rates
since 1961 would justify some offsetting reduction in the coverage
of  charges  required  obviously  it  would  be  much  harder  for  an
industrial  company  to  show  a  seventimes  coverage  of  interest
charges at 8 than at 412 to meet this changed situation we now
suggest an alternative requirement related to the percent earned on

security analysis for the lay investor

285

the principal amount of the debt these figures might be 33 before
taxes for an industrial company 20 for a public utility and 25
for a railroad it should be borne in mind here that the rate actually
paid  by  most  companies  on  their  total  debt  is  considerably  less
than  the  current  8  figures  since  they  have  the  benefit  of  older
issues  bearing  lower  coupons  the  poorest  year  requirement
could be set at about twothirds of the sevenyear requirement

in addition to the earningscoverage test a number of others are

generally applied these include the following

1 size  of  enterprise there  is  a  minimum  standard  in  terms  of
volume of business for a corporationvarying as between indus
trials utilities and railroadsand of population for a municipality

2 stockequity  ratio this  is  the  ratio  of  the  market  price  of  the
junior stock issues to the total face amount of the debt or the debt
plus preferred stock it is a rough measure of the protection or cush
ion afforded by the presence of a junior investment that must first
bear the brunt of unfavorable developments this factor includes the
markets appraisal of the future prospects of the enterprise

3 property value the asset values as shown on the balance sheet
or  as  appraised  were  formerly  considered  the  chief  security  and
protection  for  a  bond  issue  experience  has  shown  that  in  most
cases safety resides in the earning power and if this is deficient the
assets  lose  most  of  their  reputed  value  asset  values  however
retain  importance  as  a  separate  test  of  ample  security  for  bonds
and  preferred  stocks  in  three  enterprise  groups  public  utilities
because  rates  may  depend  largely  on  the  property  investment
realestate concerns and investment companies

at this point the alert investor should ask how dependable are
tests of safety that are measured by past and present performance
in view of the fact that payment of interest and principal depends
upon what the future will bring forth the answer can be founded

 by  junior  stock  issues  graham  means  shares  of  common  stock  pre
ferred stock is considered senior to common stock because the company
must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any dividends on the
common

286

the intelligent investor

only on experience investment history shows that bonds and pre
ferred  stocks  that  have  met  stringent  tests  of  safety  based  on  the
past have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi
tudes  of  the  future  successfully  this  has  been  strikingly  demon
strated in the major field of railroad bondsa field that has been
marked  by  a  calamitous  frequency  of  bankruptcies  and  serious
losses in nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long
been  overbonded  had  shown  an  inadequate  coverage  of  fixed
charges in periods of average prosperity and would thus have been
ruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety conversely
practically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial
embarrassment  our  premise  was  strikingly  vindicated  by  the
financial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s
and in 1950 all of these with one exception started their careers
with fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of
fixedinterest requirements was ample or at least respectable the
exception was the new haven railroad which in its reorganization
year 1947 earned its new charges only about 11 times in conse
quence while all the other roads were able to come through rather
difficult times with solvency unimpaired the new haven relapsed
into trusteeship for the third time in 1961

in chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank
ruptcy  of  the  penn  central  railroad  which  shook  the  financial
community  in  1970 an  elementary  fact  in  this  case  was  that  the
coverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as
early as 1965 hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided
or disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan
cial collapse

our  observations  on  the  adequacy  of  the  past  record  to  judge
future  safety  apply  and  to  an  even  greater  degree  to  the  public
utilities  which  constitute  a  major  area  for  bond  investment
receivership of a soundly capitalized electric utility company or
system is almost impossible since securities and exchange com
mission control was instituted along with the breakup of most of

 after  investors  lost  billions  of  dollars  on  the  shares  of  recklessly  assem
bled utility companies in 19291932 congress authorized the sec to reg
ulate the issuance of utility stocks under the public utility holding company
act of 1935

security analysis for the lay investor

287

the  holdingcompany  systems  publicutility  financing  has  been
sound  and  bankruptcies  unknown  the  financial  troubles  of  elec
tric  and  gas  utilities  in  the  1930s  were  traceable  almost  100  to
financial  excesses  and  mismanagement  which  left  their  imprint
clearly  on  the  companies  capitalization  structures  simple  but
stringent tests of safety therefore would have warned the investor
away from the issues that were later to default

among  industrial  bond  issues  the  longterm  record  has  been
different although  the  industrial  group  as  a  whole  has  shown  a
better growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util
ities it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ
ual companies and lines of business thus in the past at least there
have been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus
trial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of
major size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a
serious depression

few defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950 but
this fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression
during this long period since 1966 there have been adverse devel
opments  in  the  financial  position  of  many  industrial  companies
considerable  difficulties  have  developed  as  the  result  of  unwise
expansion  on  the  one  hand  this  has  involved  large  additions  to
both bank loans and longterm debt on the other it has frequently
produced  operating  losses  instead  of  the  expected  profits at  the
beginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the
interest  payments  of  all  nonfinancial  firms  had  grown  from  98
billion in 1963 to 261 billion in 1970 and that interest payments
had taken 29 of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in
1971  against  only  16  in  19633 obviously  the  burden  on  many
individual firms had increased much more than this overbonded
companies  have  become  all  too  familiar  there  is  every  reason  to
repeat the caution expressed in our 1965 edition

we are not quite ready to suggest that the investor may count
on an indefinite continuance of this favorable situation and hence
relax his standards of bond selection in the industrial or any other
group

288

the intelligent investor

commonstock analysis

the ideal form of commonstock analysis leads to a valuation of
the  issue  which  can  be  compared  with  the  current  price  to  deter
mine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase this val
uation  in  turn  would  ordinarily  be  found  by  estimating  the
average earnings over a period of years in the future and then mul
tiplying that estimate by an appropriate capitalization factor

the  nowstandard  procedure  for  estimating  future  earning
power  starts  with  average  past data  for  physical  volume  prices
received  and  operating  margin  future  sales  in  dollars  are  then
projected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in
volume and price level over the previous base these estimates in
turn  are  grounded  first  on  general  economic  forecasts  of  gross
national product and then on special calculations applicable to the
industry and company in question

an  illustration  of  this  method  of  valuation  may  be  taken  from
our 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel the
value line a leading investment service makes forecasts of future
earnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above and then
derives a figure of price potentiality or projected market value
by applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer
tain past relationships in table 112 we reproduce the projections
for 19671969 made in june 1964 and compare them with the earn
ings  and  average  market  price  actually  realized  in  1968  which
approximates the 19671969 period

the combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side
but not seriously so the corresponding predictions made six years
before  had  turned  out  to  be  overoptimistic  on  earnings  and  divi
dends but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier with the
result  that  the  price  potentiality  figure  proved  to  be  about  the
same as the actual average price for 1963

the reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore
casts were wide of the mark this is an instance in support of our
general view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a
good deal more dependable than those for individual companies
ideally perhaps the security analyst should pick out the three or
four companies whose future he thinks he knows the best and con
centrate his own and his clients interest on what he forecasts for

the intelligent investor

them unfortunately it appears to be almost impossible to distin
guish in advance between those individual forecasts which can be
relied upon and those which are subject to a large chance of error
at bottom this is the reason for the wide diversification practiced
by  the  investment  funds  for  it  is  undoubtedly  better  to  concen
trate on one stock that you know is going to prove highly profitable
rather  than  dilute  your  results  to  a  mediocre  figure  merely  for
diversifications  sake  but  this  is  not  done  because  it  cannot  be
done dependably4 the prevalence of wide diversification is in itself
a pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of selectivity to which wall
street constantly pays lip service

factors affecting the capitalization rate

though  average  future  earnings  are  supposed  to  be  the  chief
determinant  of  value  the  security  analyst  takes  into  account  a
number of other factors of a more or less definite nature most of
these will enter into his capitalization rate which can vary over a
wide range depending upon the quality of the stock issue thus
although  two  companies  may  have  the  same  figure  of  expected

 in more recent years most mutual funds have almost robotically mimicked
the  standard    poors  500stock  index  lest  any  different  holdings  because
their returns to deviate from that of the index in a countertrend some fund
companies have launched what they call focused portfolios which own 25
to 50 stocks that the managers declare to be their best ideas that leaves
investors  wondering  whether  the  other  funds  run  by  the  same  managers
contain their worst ideas considering that most of the best idea funds do
not markedly outperform the averages investors are also entitled to wonder
whether  the  managers  ideas  are  even  worth  having  in  the  first  place  for
indisputably skilled investors like warren buffett wide diversification would
be foolish since it would water down the concentrated force of a few great
ideas but for the typical fund manager or individual investor not diversifying
is foolish since it is so difficult to select a limited number of stocks that will
include most winners and exclude most losers as you own more stocks the
damage any single loser can cause will decline and the odds of owning all
the big winners will rise the ideal choice for most investors is a total stock
market index fund a lowcost way to hold every stock worth owning

security analysis for the lay investor

291

earnings  per  share  in  19731975say  4the  analyst  may  value
one as low as 40 and the other as high as 100 let us deal briefly
with  some  of  the  considerations  that  enter  into  these  divergent
multipliers

1 general  longterm  prospects no  one  really  knows  anything
about  what  will  happen  in  the  distant  future  but  analysts  and
investors  have  strong  views  on  the  subject  just  the  same  these
views  are  reflected  in  the  substantial  differentials  between  the
priceearnings  ratios  of  individual  companies  and  of  industry
groups at this point we added in our 1965 edition

for example at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the
djia were  selling  at  considerably  higher  multipliers  than  the  oil
companies indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the
former than of the latter such distinctions made by the market are
often  soundly  based  but  when  dictated  mainly  by  past  perfor
mance they are as likely to be wrong as right

we shall supply here in table 113 the 1963 yearend material
on the chemical and oil company issues in the djia and carry their
earnings to the end of 1970 it will be seen that the chemical compa
nies  despite  their  high  multipliers  made  practically  no  gain  in
earnings in the period after 1963 the oil companies did much bet
ter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in
their 1963 multipliers5 thus our chemicalstock example proved to
be  one  of  the  cases  in  which  the  market  multipliers  were  proven
wrong

 grahams point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to
nearly  every  industry  in  nearly  every  time  period  wall  streets  consensus
view of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too
pessimistic  worse  the  consensus  is  at  its  most  cheery  just  when  the
stocks  are  most  overpricedand  gloomiest  just  when  they  are  cheapest
the most recent example of course is technology and telecommunications
stocks which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999
and early 2000 and then crashed all the way through 2002 history proves
that  wall  streets  expert  forecasters  are  equally  inept  at  predicting  the

security analysis for the lay investor

2 management on wall street a great deal is constantly said on
this subject but little that is really helpful until objective quantita
tive  and  reasonably  reliable  tests  of  managerial  competence  are
devised  and  applied  this  factor  will  continue  to  be  looked  at
through a fog it is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful
company has unusually good management this will have shown
itself already in the past record it will show up again in the esti
mates for the next five years and once more in the previously dis
cussed factor of longterm prospects the tendency to count it still
another time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to
expensive overvaluations the management factor is most useful
we think in those cases in which a recent change has taken place
that has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual
figures

two  spectacular  occurrences  of  this  kind  were  associated  with
the chrysler motor corporation the first took place as far back as
1921  when  walter  chrysler  took  command  of  the  almost  mori
bund  maxwell  motors  and  in  a  few  years  made  it  a  large  and
highly  profitable  enterprise  while  numerous  other  automobile
companies  were  forced  out  of  business  the  second  happened  as
recently  as  1962  when  chrysler  had  fallen  far  from  its  once  high
estate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years
then new interests associated with consolidation coal took over
the reins the earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of 124 per
share to the equivalent of 17 in 1963 and the price rose from a low
of 3812 in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year6

3 financial  strength  and  capital  structure stock  of  a  company
with  a  lot  of  surplus  cash  and  nothing  ahead  of  the  common  is
clearly a better purchase at the same price than another one with
the same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi
ties such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by
security  analysts  a modest  amount  of  bonds  or  preferred  stock

performance of 1 the market as a whole 2 industry sectors and 3 spe
cific stocks as graham points out the odds that individual investors can do
any better are not good the intelligent investor excels by making decisions
that  are  not  dependent  on  the  accuracy  of  anybodys  forecasts  including
his or her own see chapter 8

294

the intelligent investor

however is not necessarily a disadvantage to the common nor is
the moderate use of seasonal bank credit incidentally a topheavy
structuretoo  little  common  stock  in  relation  to  bonds  and  pre
ferredmay under favorable conditions make for a huge specula
tive profit in the common this is the factor known as leverage

4 dividend record one of the most persuasive tests of high qual
ity  is  an  uninterrupted  record  of  dividend  payments  going  back
over  many  years  we  think  that  a  record  of  continuous  dividend
payments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor
in  the  companys  quality  rating  indeed  the  defensive  investor
might  be  justified  in  limiting  his  purchases  to  those  meeting  this
test

5 current  dividend  rate this  our  last  additional  factor  is  the
most difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion fortunately
the majority of companies have come to follow what may be called
a  standard  dividend  policy  this  has  meant  the  distribution  of
about twothirds of their average earnings except that in the recent
period  of  high  profits  and  inflationary  demands  for  more  capital
the  figure  has  tended  to  be  lower  in  1969  it  was  595  for  the
stocks in the dow jones average and 55 for all american corpo
rations  where  the  dividend  bears  a  normal  relationship  to  the
earnings the valuation may be made on either basis without sub
stantially  affecting  the  result  for  example  a  typical  secondary
company  with  expected  average  earnings  of  3  and  an  expected
dividend of 2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18
times its dividend to yield a value of 36 in both cases

however  an  increasing  number  of  growth  companies  are
departing  from  the  once  standard  policy  of  paying  out  60  or
more of earnings in dividends on the grounds that the sharehold

 this figure now known as the dividend payout ratio has dropped consid
erably since grahams day as american tax law discouraged investors from
seeking and corporations from paying dividends as of yearend 2002 the
payout ratio stood at 341 for the s  p 500stock index and as recently
as  april  2000  it  hit  an  alltime  low  of  just  253  see  wwwbarracom
researchfundamentalsasp we discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in
the commentary on chapter 19

ers interests will be better served by retaining nearly all the profits
to  finance  expansion  the  issue  presents  problems  and  requires
careful distinctions we have decided to defer our discussion of the
vital question of proper dividend policy to a later sectionchapter
19where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of
managementshareholder relations

capitalization rates for growth stocks

most  of  the  writing  of  security  analysts  on  formal  appraisals
relates to the valuation of growth stocks our study of the various
methods  has  led  us  to  suggest  a  foreshortened  and  quite  simple
formula  for  the  valuation  of  growth  stocks  which  is  intended  to
produce  figures  fairly  close  to  those  resulting  from  the  more
refined mathematical calculations our formula is

value  current normal earnings cid1 85 plus twice 
the expected annual growth rate

the growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to
ten years7

in table 114 we show how our formula works out for various
rates of assumed growth it is easy to make the converse calcula
tion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur
rent  market  price  assuming  our  formula  is  valid  in  our  last
edition we made that calculation for the djia and for six important
stock issues these figures are reproduced in table 115 we com
mented at the time

the  difference  between  the  implicit  324  annual  growth  rate
for  xerox  and  the  extremely  modest  28  for  general  motors  is
indeed striking it is explainable in part by the stock markets feel
ing that general motors 1963 earningsthe largest for any corpo
ration in historycan be maintained with difficulty and exceeded
only  modestly  at  best  the  price  earnings  ratio  of  xerox  on  the
other hand is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas
tened  upon  a  company  of  great  achievement  and  perhaps  still
greater promise

the implicit or expected growth rate of 51 for the djia com

pares  with  an  actual  annual  increase  of  34  compounded
between 19511953 and 19611963

we should have added a caution somewhat as follows the val
uations of expected highgrowth stocks are necessarily on the low
side if we were to assume these growth rates will actually be real
ized  in  fact  according  to  the  arithmetic  if  a  company  could  be
assumed to grow at a rate of 8 or more indefinitely in the future its
value would be infinite and no price would be too high to pay for
the shares what the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro
duce a margin of safety into his calculationssomewhat as an engi
never  does  in  his  specifications  for  a  structure  on  this  basis  the
purchases  would  realize  his  assigned  objective  in  1963  a  future
overall return of 712 per annum even if the growth rate actually
realized  proved  substantially  less  than  that  projected  in  the  for
mula  of  course  then  if  that  rate  were  actually  realized  the
investor  would  be  sure  to  enjoy  a  handsome  additional  return
there  is  really  no  way  of  valuing  a  highgrowth  company  with 
an  expected  rate  above  say  8  annually  in  which  the  analyst 
can  make  realistic  assumptions  of  both the  proper  multiplier  for 
the  current  earnings  and  the  expectable  multiplier  for  the  future
earnings

as  it  happened  the  actual  growth  for  xerox  and  ibm  proved
very  close  to  the  high  rates  implied  from  our  formula  as  just
explained this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance
in the price of both issues the growth of the djia itself was also
about as projected by the 1963 closing market price but the moder
ate rate of 5 did not involve the mathematical dilemma of xerox
and ibm it turned out that the 23 price rise to the end of 1970
plus  the  28  in  aggregate  dividend  return  received  gave  not  far
from  the  712  annual  overall  gain  posited  in  our  formula  in  the
case  of  the  other  four  companies  it  may  suffice  to  say  that  their
growth  did  not  equal  the  expectations  implied  in  the  1963  price
and that their quotations failed to rise as much as the djia warn
ing this  material  is  supplied  for  illustrative  purposes  only  and
because of the inescapable necessity in security analysis to project
the future growth rate for most companies studied let the reader
not  be  misled  into  thinking  that  such  projections  have  any  high
degree  of  reliability  or  conversely  that  future  prices  can  be

298

the intelligent investor

counted  on  to  behave  accordingly  as  the  prophecies  are  realized
surpassed or disappointed

we should point out that any scientific or at least reasonably
dependable  stock  evaluation  based  on  anticipated  future  results
must  take  future  interest  rates  into  account  a given  schedule  of
expected  earnings  or  dividends  would  have  a  smaller  present
value  if  we  assume  a  higher  than  if  we  assume  a  lower  interest
structure  such  assumptions  have  always  been  difficult  to  make
with  any  degree  of  confidence  and  the  recent  violent  swings  in
longterm  interest  rates  render  forecasts  of  this  sort  almost  pre
sumptuous hence we have retained our old formula above sim
ply because no new one would appear more plausible

industry analysis

because  the  general  prospects  of  the  enterprise  carry  major
weight  in  the  establishment  of  market  prices  it  is  natural  for  the
security analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic
position  of  the  industry  and  of  the  individual  company  in  its
industry studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail they are
sometimes  productive  of  valuable  insights  into  important  factors
that will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci
ated by the current market where a conclusion of that kind can be
drawn with a fair degree of confidence it affords a sound basis for
investment decisions

our  own  observation  however  leads  us  to  minimize  some
what  the  practical  value  of  most  of  the  industry  studies  that  are
made available to investors the material developed is ordinarily
of a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that
has  already  exerted  considerable  influence  on  market  quotations

 why is this by the rule of 72 at 10 interest a given amount of money
doubles in just over seven years while at 7 it doubles in just over 10 years
when interest rates are high the amount of money you need to set aside 
today to reach a given value in the future is lowersince those high interest
rates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate thus a rise in interest rates
today  makes  a  future  stream  of  earnings  or  dividends  less  valuablesince 
the alternative of investing in bonds has become relatively more attractive

security analysis for the lay investor

299

rarely  does  one  find  a  brokeragehouse  study  that  points  out 
with a convincing array of facts that a popular industry is head
ing  for  a  fall  or  that  an  unpopular  one  is  due  to  prosper  wall
streets  view  of  the  longer  future  is  notoriously  fallible  and  this
necessarily  applies  to  that  important  part  of  its  investigations
which is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in
various industries

we must  recognize  however  that  the  rapid  and  pervasive
growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on
the attitude and the labors of the security analyst more so than in
the past the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the
coming  decade  may  depend  on  its  relation  to  new  products  and
new processes which the analyst may have a chance to study and
evaluate in  advance thus  there  is  doubtless  a  promising  area  for
effective work by the analyst based on field trips interviews with
research men and on intensive technological investigation on his
own  there  are  hazards  connected  with  investment  conclusions
derived  chiefly  from  such  glimpses  into  the  future  and  not  sup
ported  by  presently  demonstrable  value  yet  there  are  perhaps
equal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober
calculations  resting  on  actual  results  the  investor  cannot  have  it
both ways he can be imaginative and play for the big profits that
are the reward for vision proved sound by the event but then he
must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation or he
can be conservative and refuse to pay more than a minor premium
for possibilities as yet unproved but in that case he must be pre
pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone

a twopart appraisal process

let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal
of a common stock which we began to discuss above on p 288 a
great  deal  of  reflection  on  the  subject  has  led  us  to  conclude  that
this  better  be  done  quite  differently  than  is  now  the  established
practice we suggest that analysts work out first what we call the
pastperformance  value  which  is  based  solely  on  the  past
record  this  would  indicate  what  the  stock  would  be  worth
absolutely or as a percentage of the djia or of the s  p compos
iteif it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue

300

the intelligent investor

unchanged in the future this includes the assumption that its rel
ative growth rate as shown in the last seven years will also con
tinue unchanged over the next seven years this process could be
carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ
ual  weights  to  past  figures  for  profitability  stability  and  growth
and  also  for  current  financial  condition  the  second  part  of  the
analysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on
past  performance  should  be  modified  because  of  new  conditions
expected in the future

such  a  procedure  would  divide  the  work  between  senior  and
junior analysts as follows 1 the senior analyst would set up the
formula to apply to all companies generally for determining past
performance  value  2  the  junior  analysts  would  work  up  such
factors for the designated companiespretty much in mechanical
fashion  3  the  senior  analyst  would  then  determine  to  what
extent a companys performanceabsolute or relativeis likely to
differ  from  its  past  record  and  what  change  should  be  made  in 
the value to reflect such anticipated changes it would be best if the
senior analysts report showed both the original valuation and the
modified one with his reasons for the change

is a job of this kind worth doing our answer is in the affirma
tive but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader
we doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently
dependable in the case of the typical industrial company great or
small  we  shall  illustrate  the  difficulties  of  this  job  in  our  discus
sion  of  aluminum  company  of  america  alcoa  in  the  next
chapter  nonetheless  it  should  be  done  for  such  common  stocks
why first many security analysts are bound to make current or
projected  valuations  as  part  of  their  daily  work  the  method  we
propose  should  be  an  improvement  on  those  generally  followed
today  secondly  because  it  should  give  useful  experience  and
insight to the analysts who practice this method thirdly because
work  of  this  kind  could  produce  an  invaluable  body  of  recorded
experienceas has long been the case in medicinethat may lead
to better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos
sibilities  and  limitations  the  publicutility  stocks  might  well
prove  an  important  area  in  which  this  approach  will  show  real
pragmatic  value  eventually  the  intelligent  analyst  will  confine
himself  to  those  groups  in  which  the  future  appears  reasonably

in  subsequent  chapters  we  shall  supply  concrete  examples  of

years a recent article in the financial analysts journal confirmed
what  other  studies  and  the  sad  experience  of  many  investors
have shown that the fastestgrowing companies tend to overheat

if a company reprices or reissues or exchanges its stock
options for insiders stay away in this switcheroo a company can
cels existing and typically worthless stock options for employees
and  executives  then  replaces  them  with  new  ones  at  advanta

their potential profit is always infinite how can options encourage
good stewardship of corporate assets any established company
that reprices optionsas dozens of hightech firms haveis a dis

financial strength and capital structure the most basic possible
definition  of  a  good  business  is  this  it  generates  more  cash  than  it
consumes good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to
productive use in the long run companies that meet this definition are
virtually  certain  to  grow  in  value  no  matter  what  the  stock  market
does

start  by  reading  the  statement  of  cash  flows  in  the  companys
annual report see whether cash from operations has grown steadily
throughout the past 10 years then you can go further warren buffett
has  popularized  the  concept  of  owner  earnings or  net  income  plus
amortization and depreciation minus normal capital expenditures as
portfolio manager christopher davis of davis selected advisors puts
it if you owned 100 of this business how much cash would you
have  in  your  pocket  at  the  end  of  the  year  because  it  adjusts  for
accounting  entries  like  amortization  and  depreciation  that  do  not
affect the companys cash balances owner earnings can be a better
measure than reported net income to finetune the definition of owner
earnings you should also subtract from reported net income






any  costs  of  granting  stock  options  which  divert  earnings  away
from existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners
any unusual nonrecurring or extraordinary charges
any income from the companys pension fund

if owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at
least 6 or 7 over the past 10 years the company is a stable gen
erator of cash and its prospects for growth are good

next look at the companys capital structure turn to the balance
sheet to see how much debt including preferred stock the company
has in general longterm debt should be under 50 of total capital
in  the  footnotes  to  the  financial  statements  determine  whether  the
longterm debt is fixedrate with constant interest payments or vari
able with payments that fluctuate which could become costly if inter
est rates rise

look in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the
ratio  of  earnings  to  fixed  charges  that  exhibit  to  amazoncoms
2002  annual  report  shows  that  amazons  earnings  fell  145  million
short  of  covering  its  interest  costs  in  the  future  amazon  will  either
have to earn much more from its operations or find a way to borrow
money  at  lower  rates  otherwise  the  company  could  end  up  being

owned  not  by  its  shareholders  but  by  its  bondholders  who  can  lay
claim  to  amazons  assets  if  they  have  no  other  way  of  securing  the
interest payments they are owed to be fair amazons ratio of earn
ings to fixed charges was far healthier in 2002 than two years earlier
when earnings fell 11 billion short of covering debt payments

the burden of proof is on the company to show that you are better
off if it does not pay a dividend if the firm has consistently outper
formed the competition in good markets and bad the managers are
clearly putting the cash to optimal use if however business is fal
tering or the stock is underperforming its rivals then the managers
and directors are misusing the cash by refusing to pay a dividend

splits miss the point two shares of a stock at 50 are not worth
more  than  one  share  at  100  managers  who  use  splits  to  pro
mote their stock are aiding and abetting the worst instincts of the
investing public and the intelligent investor will think twice before
turning any money over to such condescending manipulators10
companies should buy back their shares when they are cheap
not  when  they  are  at  or  near  record  highs  unfortunately  it
recently  has  become  all  too  common  for  companies  to  repur
chase their stock when it is overpriced there is no more cynical
waste of a companys cashsince the real purpose of that maneu
ver is to enable top executives to reap multimilliondollar paydays
by  selling  their  own  stock  options  in  the  name  of  enhancing
shareholder value

a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence in fact suggests that
managers who talk about enhancing shareholder value seldom do
in investing as with life in general ultimate victory usually goes to the

things to consider about 

pershare earnings

this chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor
that  cannot  avoid  being  contradictory  in  their  implications  the
first is do not take a single years earnings seriously the second is
if you do pay attention to shortterm earnings look out for booby
traps  in  the  pershare  figures  if  our  first  warning  were  followed
strictly  the  second  would  be  unnecessary  but  it  is  too  much  to
expect  that  most  shareholders  can  relate  all  their  commonstock
decisions to the longterm record and the longterm prospects the
quarterly figures and especially the annual figures receive major
attention  in  financial  circles  and  this  emphasis  can  hardly  fail  to
have its impact on the investors thinking he may well need some
education in this area for it abounds in misleading possibilities

as  this  chapter  is  being  written  the  earnings  report  of  alu
minum  company  of  america  alcoa  for  1970  appears  in  the
wall street journal the first figures shown are

share earnings a

1970
520

1969
558

the little a at the outset is explained in a footnote to refer to pri
mary earnings before special charges there is much more foot
note  material  in  fact  it  occupies  twice  as  much  space  as  do  the
basic figures themselves

for  the  december  quarter  alone  the  earnings  per  share  are

given as 158 in 1970 against 156 in 1969

the investor or speculator interested in alcoa shares reading

310

things to consider about pershare earnings

311

those figures might say to himself not so bad i knew that 1970
was a recession year in aluminum but the fourth quarter shows a
gain over 1969 with earnings at the rate of 632 per year let me
see the stock is selling at 62 why that is less than ten times earn
ings that makes it look pretty cheap compared with 16 times for
international nickel etc etc

but if our investorspeculator friend had bothered to read all the
material in the footnote he would have found that instead of one
figure  of  earnings  per  share  for  the  year  1970  there  were  actually
four viz

primary earnings
net income after special charges
fully diluted before special charges
fully diluted after special charges

1970

520
432
501
419

1969

558
558
535
535

for the fourth quarter alone only two figures are given

primary earnings
net income after special charges

158
70

156
156

what do all these additional earnings mean which earnings are
true earnings for the year and the december quarter if the latter
should be taken at 70 centsthe net income after special charges
the  annual  rate  would  be  280  instead  of  632  and  the  price  62
would  be  22  times  earnings  instead  of  the  10  times  we  started
with

part of the question as to the true earnings of alcoa can be
answered quite easily the reduction from 520 to 501 to allow
for the effects of dilution is clearly called for alcoa has a large
bond issue convertible into common stock to calculate the earn
ing  power  of  the  common  based  on  the  1970  results  it  must  be
assumed that the conversion privilege will be exercised if it should
prove profitable to the bondholders to do so the amount involved
in  the  alcoa picture  is  relatively  small  and  hardly  deserves
detailed  comment  but  in  other  cases  making  allowance  for  con

reduce  the  apparent  earnings  by  half  or  more  we  shall  present
examples  of  a  really  significant  dilution  factor  below  page  411
the financial services are not always consistent in their allowance
for the dilution factor in their reporting and analyses

let us turn now to the matter of special charges this figure of
18800000 or 88 cents per share deducted in the fourth quarter is
not unimportant is it to be ignored entirely or fully recognized as
an  earnings  reduction  or  partly  recognized  and  partly  ignored
the alert investor might ask himself also how does it happen that
there was a virtual epidemic of such special chargeoffs appearing
after the close of 1970 but not in previous years could there pos
sibly have been some fine italian hands at work with the account
ingbut  always  of  course  within  the  limits  of  the  permissible
when  we  look  closely  we  may  find  that  such  losses  charged  off
before they actually occur can be charmed away as it were with
no unhappy effect on either past or future primary earnings in
some extreme cases they might be availed of to make subsequent
earnings  appear  nearly  twice  as  large  as  in  realityby  a  more  or
less prestidigitous treatment of the tax credit involved

 dilution  is  one  of  many  words  that  describe  stocks  in  the  language  of
fluid dynamics a stock with high trading volume is said to be liquid when
a company goes public in an ipo it floats its shares and in earlier days a
company that drastically diluted its shares with large amounts of convert
ible debt or multiple offerings of common stock was said to have watered
its stock this term is believed to have originated with the legendary market
manipulator daniel drew 17971879 who began as a livestock trader he
would  drive  his  cattle  south  toward  manhattan  forcefeeding  them  salt
along the way when they got to the harlem river they would guzzle huge
volumes of water to slake their thirst drew would then bring them to market
where  the  water  they  had  just  drunk  would  increase  their  weight  that
enabled him to get a much higher price since cattle on the hoof is sold by
the pound drew later watered the stock of the erie railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning

in  dealing  with  alcoas  special  charges  the  first  thing  to
establish is how they arose the footnotes are specific enough the
deductions came from four sources viz

1 managements  estimate  of  the  anticipated  costs  of  closing

down the manufactured products division

2 ditto for closing down alcoa castings cos plants
3 ditto for losses in phasing out alcoa credit co
4 also  estimated  costs  of  53  million  associated  with  comple

tion of the contract for a curtain wall

all of these items are related to future costs and losses it is easy
to  say  that  they  are  not  part  of  the  regular  operating  results  of
1970but if so where do they belong are they so extraordinary
and nonrecurring as to belong nowhere a widespread enterprise
such as alcoa doing a 15 billion business annually must have
a lot of divisions departments affiliates and the like would it not
be  normal  rather  than  extraordinary  for  one  or  more  to  prove
unprofitable  and  to  require  closing  down  similarly  for  such
things as a contract to build a wall suppose that any time a com
pany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of
charging it off as a special item and thus reporting its primary
earnings  per  share  so  as  to  include  only  its  profitable  contracts
and operations like king edward viis sundial that marked only
the sunny hours

 the  king  probably  took  his  inspiration  from  a  oncefamous  essay  by  the
english writer william hazlitt who mused about a sundial near venice that
bore the words horas non numero nisi serenas or i count only the hours
that  are  serene  companies  that  chronically  exclude  bad  news  from  their
financial  results  on  the  pretext  that  negative  events  are  extraordinary  or
nonrecurring  are  taking  a  page  from  hazlitt  who  urged  his  readers  to
take no note of time but by its benefits to watch only for the smiles and ne
glect the frowns of fate to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments
turning away to the sunny side of things and letting the rest slip from our
imaginations unheeded or forgotten william hazlitt on a sundial ca
1827 unfortunately investors must always count the sunny and dark hours
alike

314

the intelligent investor

the  reader  should  note  two  ingenious  aspects  of  the  alcoa
procedure we have been discussing the first is that by anticipating
future  losses the  company  escapes  the  necessity  of  allocating  the
losses  themselves  to  an  identifiable  year  they  do not  belong  in
1970 because they were not actually taken in that year and they
will not be shown in the year when they are actually taken because
they have already been provided for neat work but might it not
be just a little misleading

the alcoa footnote says nothing about the future tax saving
from these losses most other statements of this sort state specifi
cally  that  only  the  aftertax  effect  has  been  charged  off  if  the
alcoa figure represents future losses before the related tax credit
then not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these
charges as they are actually incurred but they will be increased by
a  tax  credit  of  some  50  thereof  it  is  difficult  to  believe  that  the
accounts will be handled that way but it is a fact that certain com
panies  which  have  had  large  losses  in  the  past  have  been  able  to
report  future  earnings  without  charging  the  normal  taxes  against
them in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed
based  paradoxically  enough  on  their  past  disgraces  tax  credits
resulting from past years losses are now being shown separately as
special items but they will enter into future statistics as part of
the  final  netincome  figure  however  a  reserve  now  set  up  for
future losses if net of expected tax credit should not create an addi
tion of this sort to the net income of later years

the  other  ingenious  feature  is  the  use  by  alcoa and  many
other  companies  of  the  1970  yearend  for  making  these  special
chargeoffs  the  stock  market  took  what  appeared  to  be  a  blood
bath  in  the  first  half  of  1970  everyone  expected  relatively  poor
results for the year for most companies wall street was now antic
ipating better results in 1971 1972 etc what a nice arrangement
then  to  charge  as  much  as  possible  to  the  bad  year  which  had
already  been  written  off  mentally  and  had  virtually  receded  into
the  past  leaving  the  way  clear  for  nicely  fattened  figures  in  the
next few years perhaps this is good accounting good business pol
icy  and  good  for  managementshareholder  relationships  but  we
have lingering doubts

the combination of widely or should it be wildly diversified
operations with the impulse to clean house at the end of 1970 has

produced  some  strangelooking  footnotes  to  the  annual  reports
the reader may be amused by the following explanation given by 
a  new  york  stock  exchange  company  which  shall  remain
unnamed of its special items aggregating 2357000 or about a
third  of  the  income  before  chargeoffs  consists  of  provision  for
closing spalding united kingdom operations provision for reorga
nizational  expenses  of  a  division  costs  of  selling  a  small  baby
pants  and  bib  manufacturing  company  disposing  of  part  interest

tion 

years  ago  the  strong  companies  used  to  set  up  contingency
reserves out of the profits of good years to absorb some of the bad
effects  of  depression  years  to  come  the  underlying  idea  was  to
equalize  the  reported  earnings  more  or  less  and  to  improve  the
stability factor in the companys record a worthy motive it would
seem but the accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as
misstating the true earnings they insisted that each years results
be presented as they were good or bad and the shareholders and
analysts  be  allowed  to  do  the  averaging  or  equalizing  for  them
selves we seem now to be witnessing the opposite phenomenon
with everyone charging off as much as possible against forgotten
1970  so  as  to  start  1971  with  a  slate  not  only  clean  but  specially
prepared to show pleasing pershare figures in the coming years

it is time to return to our first question what then were the true
earnings  of alcoa in  1970  the  accurate  answer  would  be  the
501  per  share  after  dilution  less that  part  of  the  82  cents  of
special charges that may properly be attributed to occurrences in
1970 but we do not know what that portion is and hence we cannot
properly state the true earnings for the year the management and the
auditors  should  have  given  us  their  best  judgment  on  this  point
but they did not do so and furthermore the management and the
auditors  should  have  provided  for  deduction  of  the  balance  of
these  charges  from  the  ordinary  earnings of  a  suitable  number  of

 the  company  to  which  graham  refers  so  coyly  appears  to  be  american

future yearssay not more than five this evidently they will not
do  either  since  they  have  already  conveniently  disposed  of  the
entire sum as a 1970 special charge

the more seriously investors take the pershare earnings figures
as published the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard
against accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair
the  true  comparability  of  the  numbers  we  have  mentioned  three
sorts of these factors the use of special charges which may never be
reflected  in  the  pershare  earnings  the  reduction  in  the  normal
incometax deduction by reason of past losses and the dilution fac
tor  implicit  in  the  existence  of  substantial  amounts  of  convertible
securities  or  warrants1 a fourth  item  that  has  had  a  significant
effect  on  reported  earnings  in  the  past  is  the  method  of  treating
depreciationchiefly  as  between  the  straightline  and  the
accelerated  schedules  we  refrain  from  details  here  but  as  an
example  current  as  we  write  let  us  mention  the  1970  report  of
trane co this firm showed an increase of nearly 20 in pershare
earnings over 1969329 versus 276but half of this came from
returning to the older straightline depreciation rates less burden
some  on  earnings  than  the  accelerated  method  used  the  year
before the company will continue to use the accelerated rate on
its incometax return thus deferring incometax payments on the
difference  still  another  factor  important  at  times  is  the  choice
between  charging  off  research  and  development  costs  in  the  year
they  are  incurred  or  amortizing  them  over  a  period  of  years
finally  let  us  mention  the  choice  between  the  fifo  firstinfirst
out and lifo lastinfirstout methods of valuing inventories

 nowadays investors need to be aware of several other accounting fac
tors that can distort reported earnings one is pro forma or as if finan
cial  statements  which  report  a  companys  earnings  as  if  generally
accepted accounting principles gaap did not apply another is the dilu
tive effect of issuing millions of stock options for executive compensation
then buying back millions of shares to keep those options from reducing the
value of the common stock a third is unrealistic assumptions of return on
the companys pension funds which can artificially inflate earnings in good
years  and  depress  them  in  bad  another  is  special  purpose  entities  or
affiliated firms or partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the com

an obvious remark here would be that investors should not pay
any attention to these accounting variables if the amounts involved
are relatively small but wall street being as it is even items quite
minor  in  themselves  can  be  taken  seriously  two  days  before  the
alcoa report  appeared  in  the  wall  street  journal the  paper  had
quite a discussion of the corresponding statement of dow chemi
cal it closed with the observation that many analysts had been
troubled by the fact that dow had included a 21cent item in regu
lar profits for 1969 instead of treating it as an item of extraordi
nary  income  why  the  fuss  because  evidently  evaluations  of
dow chemical involving many millions of dollars in the aggregate
seemed  to  depend  on  exactly  what  was  the  percentage  gain  for
1969  over  1968in  this  case  either  9  or  412  this  strikes  us 
as rather absurd it is very unlikely that small differences involved
in  one  years  results  could  have  any  bearing  on  future  average
profits or growth and on a conservative realistic valuation of the
enterprise

by contrast consider another statement also appearing in janu
ary  1971  this  concerned  northwest  industries  incs  report  for
1970 the company was planning to write off as a special charge
not less than 264 million in one fell swoop of this 200 million
represents the loss to be taken on the proposed sale of the railroad
subsidiary  to  its  employees  and  the  balance  a  writedown  of  a
recent  stock  purchase  these  sums  would  work  out  to  a  loss  of
about 35 per share of common before dilution offsets or twice its
then current market price here we have something really signifi

pany  and  thus  remove  those  financial  risks  from  the  companys  balance
sheet another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other
soft  costs  as  assets  of  the  company  rather  than  as  normal  expenses  of
doing business we will briefly examine such practices in the commentary
that accompanies this chapter
 northwest  industries  was  the  holding  company  for  among  other  busi
nesses the chicago and northwestern railway co and union underwear
the maker of both bvd and fruit of the loom briefs it was taken over in
1985  by  overindebted  financier  william  farley  who  ran  the  company  into
the  ground  fruit  of  the  loom  was  bought  in  a  bankruptcy  proceeding  by
warren buffetts berkshire hathaway inc in early 2002

318

the intelligent investor

cannot  if  the  transaction  goes  through  and  if  the  tax  laws  are  not
changed  this  loss  provided  for  in  1970  will  permit  northwest
industries  to  realize  about  400  million  of  future  profits  within
five  years  from  its  other  diversified  interests  without  paying
income  tax  thereon  what  will  then  be  the  real  earnings  of  that
enterprise should they be calculated with or without provision for
the nearly 50 in income taxes which it will not actually have to
pay in our opinion the proper mode of calculation would be first
to consider the indicated earning power on the basis of full income
tax  liability  and  to  derive  some  broad  idea  of  the  stocks  value
based on that estimate to this should be added some bonus figure
representing  the  value  per  share  of  the  important  but  temporary
tax exemption the company will enjoy allowance must be made
also  for  a  possible  largescale  dilution  in  this  case  actually  the
convertible preferred issues and warrants would more than double
the outstanding common shares if the privileges are exercised

all this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers but it
belongs in our story corporate accounting is often tricky security
analysis  can  be  complicated  stock  valuations  are  really  depend
able  only  in  exceptional  cases  for  most  investors  it  would  be
probably best to assure themselves that they are getting good value
for the prices they pay and let it go at that

 graham is referring to the provision of federal tax law that allows corpora
tions  to  carry  forward  their  net  operating  losses  as  the  tax  code  now
stands these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years reducing the
companys  tax  liability  for  the  entire  period  and  thus  raising  its  earnings
after  tax  therefore  investors  should  consider  whether  recent  severe
losses could actually improve the companys net earnings in the future
 investors  should  keep  these  words  at  hand  and  remind  themselves  of
them frequently stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional
cases while the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the
time the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden
tical the markets judgment on price is often unreliable unfortunately the
margin of the markets pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the
expense of trading on them the intelligent investor must carefully evaluate
the costs of trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any
price  discrepancyand  should  never  count  on  being  able  to  sell  for  the
exact price currently quoted in the market

use of average earnings

in former times analysts and investors paid considerable atten
tion to the average earnings over a fairly long period in the past
usually from seven to ten years this mean figure was useful for
ironing out the frequent ups and downs of the business cycle and
it  was  thought  to  give  a  better  idea  of  the  companys  earning
power  than  the  results  of  the  latest  year  alone  one  important
advantage  of  such  an  averaging  process  is  that  it  will  solve  the
problem  of  what  to  do  about  nearly  all  the  special  charges  and
credits  they  should  be  included in  the  average  earnings  for  cer
tainly  most  of  these  losses  and  gains  represent  a  part  of  the
companys operating history if we do this for alcoa the average
earnings for 19611970 ten years would appear as 362 and for
the  seven  years  19641970  as  462  per  share  if  such  figures  are
used in conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earn
ings  during  the  same  period  they  could  give  a  really  informing
picture of the companys past performance

calculation of the past growth rate

it is of prime importance that the growth factor in a companys
record  be  taken  adequately  into  account  where  the  growth  has
been large the recent earnings will be well above the seven or ten
year average and analysts may deem these longterm figures irrel
evant  this  need  not  be  the  case  the  earnings  can  be  given  in
terms both of the average and the latest figure we suggest that the
growth rate itself be calculated by comparing the average of the last
three  years  with  corresponding  figures  ten  years  earlier  where
there  is  a  problem  of  special  charges  or  credits  it  may  be  dealt
with  on  some  compromise  basis  note  the  following  calculation
for the growth of alcoa as against that of sears roebuck and the
djia group as a whole

comment these few figures could be made the subject of a long
discussion they probably show as well as any others derived by
elaborate  mathematical  treatment  the  actual  growth  of  earnings

 mean  figure  refers  to  the  simple  or  arithmetic  average  that  graham
describes in the preceding sentence

a threefifths of special charges of 82 cents in 1970 deducted here

for the long period 19581970 but how relevant is this figure gen
erally  considered  central  in  commonstock  valuations  to  the  case
of alcoa its past growth rate was excellent actually a bit better
than that of acclaimed sears roebuck and much higher than that of
the djia composite but the market price at the beginning of 1971
seemed to pay no attention to this fine performance alcoa sold
at only 1112 times the recent threeyear average while sears sold at
27 times and the djia itself at 15 times how did this come about
evidently wall street has fairly pessimistic views about the future
course of alcoas earnings in contrast with its past record sur
prisingly enough the high price for alcoa was made as far back
as  1959  in  that  year  it  sold  at  116  or  45  times  its  earnings  this
compares with a 1959 adjusted high price of 2512 for sears roebuck
or  20  times  its  then  earnings  even  though alcoas  profits  did
show excellent growth thereafter it is evident that in this case the
future possibilities were greatly overestimated in the market price
it closed 1970 at exactly half of the 1959 high while sears tripled in
price and the djia moved up nearly 30

it  should  be  pointed  out  that  alcoas  earnings  on  capital
funds had been only average or less and this may be the decisive
factor here high multipliers have been maintained in the stock mar
ket only if the company has maintained better than average prof
itability

 graham appears to be using earnings on capital funds in the traditional
sense  of  return  on  book  valueessentially  net  income  divided  by  the
companys tangible net assets

things to consider about pershare earnings

321

let us apply at this point to alcoa the suggestion we made in
the previous chapter for a twopart appraisal process such an
approach  might  have  produced  a  pastperformance  value  for
alcoa of 10 of the djia or 84 per share relative to the closing
price  of  840  for  the  djia in  1970  on  this  basis  the  shares  would
have appeared quite attractive at their price of 5714

to what extent should the senior analyst have marked down the
pastperformance value to allow for adverse developments that
he saw in the future frankly we have no idea assume he had rea
son to believe that the 1971 earnings would be as low as 250 per
sharea  large  drop  from  the  1970  figure  as  against  an  advance
expected for the djia very likely the stock market would take this
poor performance quite seriously but would it really establish the
once  mighty  aluminum  company  of  america  as  a  relatively
unprofitable enterprise to be valued at less than its tangible assets
behind the shares in 1971 the price declined from a high of 70 in
may to a low of 36 in december against a book value of 55

alcoa is  surely  a  representative  industrial  company  of  huge
size  but  we  think  that  its  priceandearnings  history  is  more
unusual  even  contradictory  than  that  of  most  other  large  enter
prises  yet  this  instance  supports  to  some  degree  the  doubts  we
expressed in the last chapter as to the dependability of the appraisal
procedure when applied to the typical industrial company

 see pp 299301
 recent historyand a mountain of financial researchhave shown that the
market is unkindest to rapidly growing companies that suddenly report a fall
in  earnings  more  moderate  and  stable  growers  as  alcoa  was  in
grahams  day  or  anheuserbusch  and  colgatepalmolive  are  in  our  time
tend to suffer somewhat milder stock declines if they report disappointing
earnings  great  expectations  lead  to  great  disappointment  if  they  are  not
met a failure to meet moderate expectations leads to a much milder reac
tion thus one of the biggest risks in owning growth stocks is not that their
growth will stop but merely that it will slow down and in the long run that is
not merely a risk but a virtual certainty

perhaps the most widespread bit of accounting hocuspocus was the
pro  forma  earnings  fad  there is  an  old  saying  on  wall  street  that
every bad idea starts out as a good idea and pro forma earnings pre
sentation is no different the original point was to provide a truer pic
ture  of  the  longterm  growth  of  earnings  by  adjusting  for  shortterm
deviations from the trend or for supposedly nonrecurring events a
pro  forma  press  release  might  for  instance  show  what  a  company
would have earned over the past year if another firm it just acquired
had been part of the family for the entire 12 months

they might have done if they had not done as badly as they did2 as an

only cost associated with bogus earnings a recent study found that a sam

cables largely laid across the floor of the worlds oceans after wiring
the world global crossing would sell other communications compa
nies the right to carry their traffic over its network of cables in 1998
alone global crossing spent more than 600 million to construct its
optical web that year nearly a third of the construction budget was
charged  against  revenues  as  an  expense  called  cost  of  capacity
sold  if  not  for  that  178  million  expense  global  crossingwhich
reported a net loss of 96 millioncould have reported a net profit of
roughly 82 million

the  next  year  says  a  bland  footnote  in  the  1999  annual  report
global crossing initiated service contract accounting the company
would no longer charge most construction costs as expenses against
the  immediate  revenues  it  received  from  selling  capacity  on  its  net
work instead a major chunk of those construction costs would now
be treated not as an operating expense but as a capital expenditure
thereby increasing the companys total assets instead of decreasing
its net income4

poof  in  one  wave  of  the  wand  global  crossings  property  and
equipment  assets  rose  by  575  million  while  its  cost  of  sales
increased  by  a  mere  350  millioneven  though  the  company  was
spending money like a drunken sailor

capital expenditures are an essential tool for managers to make a
good  business  grow  bigger  and  better  but  malleable  accounting
rules permit managers to inflate reported profits by transforming nor

4 global  crossing  formerly  treated  much  of  its  construction  costs  as  an
expense to be charged against the revenue generated from the sale or lease
of usage rights on its network customers generally paid for their rights up
front  although  some  could  pay  in  installments  over  periods  of  up  to  four
years  but  global  crossing  did  not  book  most  of  the  revenues  up  front
instead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease now however because
the networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25 years global cross
ing began treating them as depreciable longlived capital assets while this
treatment  conforms  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  it  is
unclear why global crossing did not use it before october 1 1999 or what
exactly  prompted  the  change  as  of  march  2001  global  crossing  had  a
total  stock  valuation  of  126  billion  the  company  filed  for  bankruptcy  on
january 28 2002 rendering its common stock essentially worthless

like  many  makers  of  semiconductor  chips  micron  technology  inc
suffered a drop in sales after 2000 in fact micron was hit so hard by
the plunge in demand that it had to start writing down the value of its
inventoriessince  customers  clearly  did  not  want  them  at  the  prices
micron  had  been  asking  in  the  quarter  ended  may  2001  micron
slashed  the  recorded  value  of  its  inventories  by  261  million  most
investors interpreted the writedown not as a normal or recurring cost
of operations but as an unusual event
but look what happened after that

micron  booked  further  inventory  writedowns  in  every  one  of  the
next  six  fiscal  quarters  was  the  devaluation  of  microns  inventory  a
nonrecurring  event  or  had  it  become  a  chronic  condition  reason
able  minds  can  differ  on  this  particular  case  but  one  thing  is  clear
the  intelligent  investor  must  always  be  on  guard  for  nonrecurring
costs that like the energizer bunny just keep on going5

in 2001 sbc communications inc which owns interests in cingular
wireless pactel and southern new england telephone earned 72
billion  in  net  incomea  stellar  performance  in  a  bad  year  for  the
overextended  telecom  industry  but  that  gain  did not  come  only  from
sbcs  business  fully  14  billion  of  it13  of  the  companys  net
incomecame from sbcs pension plan

because  sbc  had  more  money  in  the  pension  plan  than  it  esti
mated was necessary to pay its employees future benefits the com
pany got to treat the difference as current income one simple reason
for that surplus in 2001 sbc raised the rate of return it expected to
earn on the pension plans investments from 85 to 95lowering
the amount of money it needed to set aside today

sbc explained its rosy new expectations by noting that for each
of  the  three  years  ended  2001  our  actual  10year  return  on  invest
ments  exceeded  10  in  other  words  our  past  returns  have  been
high so let us assume that our future returns will be too but that not
only flunked the most rudimentary tests of logic it flew in the face of
the fact that interest rates were falling to nearrecord lows depressing
the future returns on the bond portion of a pension portfolio

the same year in fact warren buffetts berkshire hathaway low
ered the expected rate of return on its pension assets from 83 to
65 was sbc being realistic in assuming that its pensionfund man
agers  could  significantly  outperform  the  worlds  greatest  investor
probably  not  in  2001  berkshire  hathaways  pension  fund  gained
98 but sbcs pension fund lost 696

5 i am grateful to howard schilit and mark hamel of the center for financial
research and analysis for providing this example
6 returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan assets at
the beginning of the year by actual return on plan assets

commentary on chapter 12

here are some quick considerations for the intelligent investor is
the net pension benefit more than 5 of the companys net income
if so would you still be comfortable with the companys other earn
ings  if  those  pension  gains  went  away  in  future  years is  the
assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets reasonable as of
2003  anything  above  65  is  implausible  while  a  rising  rate  is
downright delusional

a few pointers will help you avoid buying a stock that turns out to be
an accounting time bomb

read  backwards when  you  research  a  companys  financial
reports  start  reading  on  the  last  page  and  slowly  work  your  way
toward the front anything that the company does not want you to find
is  buried  in  the  backwhich  is  precisely  why  you  should  look  there
first

read the notes never buy a stock without reading the footnotes
to the financial statements in the annual report usually labeled sum
mary of significant accounting policies one key note describes how
the  company  recognizes  revenue  records  inventories  treats  install
ment  or  contract  sales  expenses  its  marketing  costs  and  accounts
for  the  other  major  aspects  of  its  business7 in  the  other  footnotes

7 do not be put off by the stupefyingly boring verbiage of accounting foot
notes  they  are  designed  expressly  to  deter  normal  people  from  actually
reading  themwhich  is  why  you  must  persevere  a  footnote  to  the  1996
annual report of informix corp for instance disclosed that the company
generally recognizes license revenue from sales of software licenses upon
delivery of the software product to a customer however for certain com
puter  hardware  manufacturers  and  enduser  licensees  with  amounts
payable  within  twelve  months  the  company  will  recognize  revenue  at  the
time  the  customer  makes  a  contractual  commitment  for  a  minimum  non
refundable license fee if such computer hardware manufacturers and end
user  licensees  meet  certain  criteria  established  by  the  company  in  plain
english informix was saying that it would credit itself for revenues on prod
ucts  even  if  they  had  not  yet  been  resold  to  endusers  the  actual  cus
tomers for informixs software amid allegations by the us securities and

watch for disclosures about debt stock options loans to customers
reserves  against  losses  and  other  risk  factors  that  can  take  a  big
chomp  out  of  earnings  among  the  things  that  should  make  your
antennae twitch are technical terms like capitalized deferred and
restructuringand  plainenglish  words  signaling  that  the  company
has altered its accounting practices like began change and how
ever none of those words mean you should not buy the stock but all
mean  that  you  need  to  investigate  further  be  sure  to  compare  the
footnotes  with  those  in  the  financial  statements  of  at  least  one  firm
that is  a  close  competitor  to  see  how  aggressive  your  companys
accountants are

of time and energy into your portfolio then you owe it to yourself to
learn more about financial reporting that is the only way to minimize
your odds of being misled by a shifty earnings statement three solid

a comparison of four listed companies

in  this  chapter  we  should  like  to  present  a  sample  of  security
analysis  in  operation  we  have  selected  more  or  less  at  random
four  companies  which  are  found  successively  on  the  new  york
stock  exchange  list  these  are  eltra corp  a  merger  of  electric
autolite and mergenthaler linotype enterprises emerson electric
co a manufacturer of electric and electronic products emery air
freight  a  domestic  forwarder  of  air  freight  and  emhart  corp
originally  a  maker  of  bottling  machinery  only  but  now  also  in
builders hardware there are some broad resemblances between
the three manufacturing firms but the differences will seem more
significant there should be sufficient variety in the financial and
operating data to make the examination of interest

in table 131 we present a summary of what the four companies
were selling for in the market at the end of 1970 and a few figures
on their 1970 operations we then detail certain key ratios which
relate  on  the  one  hand  to  performance and  on  the  other  to  price
comment is called for on how various aspects of the performance
pattern agree with the relative price pattern finally we shall pass
the  four  companies  in  review  suggesting  some  comparisons  and
relationships and evaluating each in terms of the requirements of a
conservative commonstock investor

 of grahams four examples only emerson electric still exists in the same
form eltra corp  is  no  longer  an  independent  company  it  merged  with
bunker  ramo  corp  in  the  1970s  putting  it  in  the  business  of  supplying
stock  quotes  to  brokerage  firms  across  an  early  network  of  computers
what remains of eltras operations is now part of honeywell corp the firm
formerly known as emery air freight is now a division of cnf inc emhart
corp was acquired by black  decker corp in 1989

the  most  striking  fact  about  the  four  companies  is  that  the 
current  priceearnings  ratios  vary  much  more  widely  than  their
operating  performance  or  financial  condition  two  of  the  enter
priseseltra and  emhartwere  modestly  priced  at  only  97
times and 12 times the average earnings for 19681970 as against a
similar figure of 155 times for the djia the other twoemerson
and emeryshowed very high multiples of 33 and 45 times such
earnings  there  is  bound  to  be  some  explanation  of  a  difference
such as this and it is found in the superior growth of the favored
companies  profits  in  recent  years  especially  by  the  freight  for
warder  but  the  growth  figures  of  the  other  two  firms  were  not
unsatisfactory

for  more  comprehensive  treatment  let  us  review  briefly  the

chief elements of performance as they appear from our figures

on  their  book  value  but  the  figures  for  emerson  and  emery  are
much  higher  than  for  the  other  two  a high  rate  of  return  on
invested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in
earnings per share all the companies except emery showed bet
ter earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961 but the emery fig
ure  was  exceptionally  large  in  both  years  b  for  manufacturing
companies the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica
tion of comparative strength or weakness we use here the ratio of
operating  income  to  sales  as  given  in  standard    poors  listed
stock  reports here  again  the  results  are  satisfactory  for  all  four
companies  with  an  especially  impressive  showing  by  emerson
the changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the
companies

2 stability this  we  measure  by  the  maximum  decline  in  per
share earnings in any one of the past ten years as against the aver
age  of  the  three  preceding  years  no  decline  translates  into  100
stability and this was registered by the two popular concerns but
the  shrinkages  of  eltra and  emhart  were  quite  moderate  in  the
poor year 1970 amounting to only 8 each by our measurement
against 7 for the djia

3 growth the two lowmultiplier companies show quite satis
factory growth rates in both cases doing better than the dow jones
group  the  eltra figures  are  especially  impressive  when  set
against its low priceearnings ratio the growth is of course more
impressive for the highmultiplier pair

4 financial position the three manufacturing companies are in
sound financial condition having better than the standard ratio of
2 of current assets for 1 of current liabilities emery air freight
has a lower ratio but it falls in a different category and with its fine
record it would have no problem raising needed cash all the com
panies have relatively low longterm debt dilution note emer
son  electric  had  163  million  of  market  value  of  lowdividend

 this measure is captured in the line net per sharebook value in table
132 which measures the companies net income as a percentage of their
tangible book value

334

the intelligent investor

convertible  preferred  shares  outstanding  at  the  end  of  1970  in 
our  analysis  we  have  made  allowance  for  the  dilution  factor  in 
the  usual  way  by  treating  the  preferred  as  if  converted  into  com
mon this decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents per share or
some 4

5 dividends what  really  counts  is  the  history  of  continuance
without interruption the best record here is emharts which has
not suspended a payment since 1902 eltras record is very good
emersons  quite  satisfactory  emery  freight  is  a  newcomer  the
variations in payout percentage do not seem especially significant
the current dividend yield is twice as high on the cheap pair as
on the dear pair corresponding to the priceearnings ratios

6 price history the reader should be impressed by the percent
age advance shown in the price of all four of these issues as mea
sured  from  the  lowest  to  the  highest  points  during  the  past  34
years in all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent
stock splits note that for the djia the range from low to high was
on  the  order  of  11  to  1  for  our  companies  the  spread  has  varied
from only 17 to 1 for emhart to no less than 528 to 1 for emery
air  freight  these  manifold  price  advances  are  characteristic  of
most  of  our  older  commonstock  issues  and  they  proclaim  the
great opportunities of profit that have existed in the stock markets
of  the  past  but  they  may  indicate  also  how  overdone  were  the
declines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were
registered both eltra and emhart sustained price shrinkages of
more than 50 in the 196970 price break emerson and emery had
serious  but  less  distressing  declines  the  former  rebounded  to  a
new alltime high before the end of 1970 the latter in early 1971

 in each case graham is referring to section c of table 132 and dividing
the high price during the 19361968 period by the low price for example
emerys  high  price  of  66  divided  by  its  low  price  of  18  equals  528  or  a
ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low

general observations on the four companies

emerson electric has an enormous total market value dwarfing
the  other  three  companies  combined  it  is  one  of  our  goodwill
giants to be commented on later a financial analyst blessed or
handicapped  with  a  good  memory  will  think  of  an  analogy
between emerson electric and zenith radio and that would not be
reassuring  for  zenith  had  a  brilliant  growth  record  for  many
years it too sold in the market for 17 billion in 1966 but its prof
its fell from 43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970 and in
that years big selloff its price declined to 2212 against the previous
top of 89 high valuations entail high risks

emery air freight must be the most promising of the four compa
nies in terms of future growth if the priceearnings ratio of nearly 40
times  its  highest  reported  earnings  is  to  be  even  partially  justified
the past growth of course has been most impressive but these fig
ures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they
started quite small at only 570000 of net earnings in 1958 it often
proves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after
volume  and  profits  have  already  expanded  to  big  totals  the  most
surprising  aspect  of  emerys  story  is  that  its  earnings  and  market
price continued to grow apace in 1970 which was the worst year in
the  domestic  airpassenger  industry  this  is  a  remarkable  achieve
ment indeed but it raises the question whether future profits may
not be vulnerable to adverse developments through increased com
petition pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air
lines  etc  an  elaborate  study  might  be  needed  before  a  sound
judgment  could  be  passed  on  these  points  but  the  conservative
investor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning

emhart and eltra emhart has done better in its business than in
the stock market over the past 14 years in 1958 it sold as high as 22
times the current earningsabout the same ratio as for the djia
since then its profits tripled as against a rise of less than 100 for
the  dow  but  its  closing  price  in  1970  was  only  a  third  above  the

 at the end of 1970 emersons 16 billion in market value truly was enor
mous given average stock sizes at the time at yearend 2002 emersons
common stock had a total market value of approximately 21 billion

336

the intelligent investor

1958 high versus 43 for the dow the record of eltra is some
what similar it appears that neither of these companies possesses
glamour or sex appeal in the present market but in all the sta
tistical  data  they  show  up  surprisingly  well  their  future  pros
pects  we  have  no  sage  remarks  to  make  here  but  this  is  what
standard  poors had to say about the four companies in 1971

eltralongterm prospects certain operations are cyclical but an
established  competitive  position  and  diversification  are  offsetting  fac
tors

emerson  electricwhile  adequately  priced  at  71  on  the  current
outlook the shares have appeal for the long term    a continued acqui
sition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields and an
accelerated  international  program  suggests  further  sales  and  earnings
progress

emery air freightthe shares appear amply priced at 57 on cur

rent prospects but are well worth holding for the long pull

emhartalthough restricted this year by lower capital spending in
the glasscontainer industry earnings should be aided by an improved
business environment in 1972 the shares are worth holding at 34

conclusions many  financial  analysts  will  find  emerson  and
emery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two
primarily  perhaps  because  of  their  better  market  action  and
secondarily  because  of  their  faster  recent  growth  in  earnings
under  our  principles  of  conservative  investment  the  first  is  not  a
valid reason for selectionthat is something for the speculators to
play around with the second has validity but within limits can
the past growth and the presumably good prospects of emery air
freight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings1 our
answer would be maybe for someone who has made an indepth
study of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep
tionally  firm  and  optimistic  conclusions  but  not for  the  careful
investor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he is not
committing  the  typical  wall  street  error  of  overenthusiasm  for
good performance in earnings and in the stock market the same

 graham was right of the nifty fifty stocks that were most fashionable
and  highly  valued  in  1972  emery  fared  among  the  worst  the  march  1

a comparison of four listed companies

337

cautionary statements seem called for in the case of emerson elec
tric  with  a  special  reference  to  the  markets  current  valuation  of
over  a  billion  dollars  for  the  intangible  or  earningpower  factor
here  we  should  add  that  the  electronics  industry  once  a  fair
haired child of the stock market has in general fallen on disastrous
days emerson is an outstanding exception but it will have to con
tinue to be such an exception for a great many years in the future
before  the  1970  closing  price  will  have  been  fully  justified  by  its
subsequent performance

by  contrast  both  eltra at  27  and  emhart  at  33  have  the  ear
marks of companies with sufficient value behind their price to con
stitute reasonably protected investments here the investor can if
he  wishes  consider  himself  basically  a  part  owner  of  these  busi
nesses at a cost corresponding to what the balance sheet shows to
be  the  money  invested  therein  the  rate  of  earnings  on  invested
capital  has  long  been  satisfactory  the  stability  of  profits  also  the
past growth rate surprisingly so the two companies will meet our
seven statistical requirements for inclusion in a defensive investors
portfolio these will be developed in the next chapter but we sum
marize them as follows

1 adequate size
2 a sufficiently strong financial condition
3 continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
4 no earnings deficit in the past ten years

1982 issue of forbes reported that since 1972 emery had lost 728 of its
value after inflation by late 1974 according to the investment researchers
at the leuthold group in minneapolis emerys stock had already fallen 58
and  its  priceearnings  ratio  had  plummeted  from  64  times  to  just  15  the
overenthusiasm  graham  had  warned  against  was  eviscerated  in  short
order can the passage of time make up for this kind of excess not always
leuthold calculated that 1000 invested in emery in 1972 would be worth
only 839 as of 1999 its likely that the people who overpaid for internet
stocks  in  the  late  1990s  will  not  break  even  for  decadesif  ever  see  the
commentary on chapter 20
 grahams point is that based on their prices at the time an investor could
buy shares in these two companies for little more than their book value as
shown in the third line of section b in table 132

338

the intelligent investor

5 tenyear growth of at least onethird in pershare earnings
6 price of stock no more than 112 times net asset value
7 price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three

years

we make no predictions about the future earnings performance
of eltra or  emhart  in  the  investors  diversified  list  of  common
stocks  there  are  bound  to  be  some  that  prove  disappointing  and
this may be the case for one or both of this pair but the diversified
list itself based on the above principles of selection plus whatever
other sensible criteria the investor may wish to apply should per
form  well  enough  across  the  years at  least  long  experience  tells 
us so

a final observation an experienced security analyst even if he
accepted  our  general  reasoning  on  these  four  companies  would
have hesitated to recommend that a holder of emerson or emery
exchange his shares for eltra or emhart at the end of 1970unless
the  holder  understood  clearly  the  philosophy  behind  the  recom
mendation there was no reason to expect that in any short period
of  time  the  lowmultiplier  duo  would  outperform  the  high
multipliers the latter were well thought of in the market and thus
had  a  considerable  degree  of  momentum  behind  them  which
might continue for an indefinite period the sound basis for prefer
ring eltra and  emhart  to  emerson  and  emery  would  be  the
clients considered conclusion that he preferred valuetype invest
ments to glamourtype investments thus to a substantial extent
commonstock  investment  policy  must  depend  on  the  attitude  of
the individual investor this approach is treated at greater length
in our next chapter

in the air force we have a rule check six a guy is flying along
looking in all directions and feeling very safe another guy flies
up behind him at 6 oclock12 of the clock is directly in front
and shoots most airplanes are shot down that way thinking
that you are safe is very dangerous somewhere there is a weak
ness you have got to find you must always check six of the clock

us  to  view  some  of  the  most  drastic  extremes  of  valuation  ever
recorded in the stock market

e l e c t r i c    n o t   e l e c t r i f y i n g

the most expensive of grahams four stocks emerson electric ended
up as the cheapest in our updated group with its base in old econ
omy industries emerson looked boring in the late 1990s in the inter
net age who cared about emersons heavyduty wetdry vacuums
the companys shares went into suspended animation in 1998 and
1999 emersons stock lagged the s  p 500 index by a cumulative
497 percentage points a miserable underperformance

but  that  was  emerson  the  stock  what  about  emerson  the  com

31  price  of  54625  emcs  shares  were  trading  at  103  times  the
earnings the company would report for the full yearnearly six times
the valuation level of emersons stock

what about emc the business revenues grew 24 in 1999 ris
ing to 67 billion its earnings per share soared to 92 cents from 61
cents the year before a 51 increase over the five years ending in
1999  emcs  earnings  had  risen  at  a  sizzling  annual  rate  of  288
and with everyone expecting the tidal wave of internet commerce to
keep rolling the future looked even brighter throughout 1999 emcs
chief executive repeatedly predicted that revenues would hit 10 bil
lion by 2001up from 54 billion in 19982 that would require aver
age annual growth of 23 a monstrous rate of expansion for so big a
company  but  wall  streets  analysts  and  most  investors  were  sure
emc could do it after all over the previous five years emc had more
than doubled its revenues and better than tripled its net income

but from 1995 through 1999 according to value line emcs net
profit  margin  slid  from  190  to  174  while  its  return  on  capital
dropped  from  268  to  21  although  still  highly  profitable  emc
was already slipping and in october 1999 emc acquired data gen
eral corp which added roughly 11 billion to emcs revenues that
year  simply  by  subtracting  the  extra  revenues  brought  in  from  data
general  we  can  see  that  the  volume  of  emcs  existing  businesses
grew from 54 billion in 1998 to just 56 billion in 1999 a rise of
only  36  in  other  words  emcs  true  growth  rate  was  almost  nil
even in a year when the scare over the y2k computer bug had led
many companies to spend record amounts on new technology3

2 appearing  on  cnbc  on  december  30  1999  emcs  chief  executive
michael  ruettgers  was  asked  by  host  ron  insana  whether  2000  and
beyond would be as good as the 1990s had been it actually looks like its
accelerating boasted ruettgers when insana asked if emcs stock was
overvalued ruettgers answered i think when you look at the opportunity
we have in front of us its almost unlimited    so while its hard to predict
whether  these  things  are  overpriced  there is  such  a  major  change  taking
place that if you could find the winners todayand i certainly think emc is
one of those peopleyoull be well rewarded in the future
3 the y2k bug or the year 2000 problem was the belief that millions of
computers worldwide would stop functioning at one second past midnight

unlike  emc  expeditors  international  had not  yet  learned  to  levitate
although the firms shares had risen 30 annually in the 1990s much
of  that  big  gain  had  come  at  the  very  end  as  the  stock  raced  to  a
1091 return in 1999 the year before expeditors shares had gone
up just 95 trailing the s  p 500 index by more than 19 percentage
points

what  about  the  business  expeditors  was  growing  expeditiously
indeed since 1995 its revenues had risen at an average annual rate
of 198 nearly tripling over the period to finish 1999 at 14 billion
and earnings per share had grown by 258 annually while dividends
had risen at a 27 annual clip expeditors had no longterm debt and
its working capital had nearly doubled since 1995 according to value
line  expeditors  book  value  per  share  had  increased  129  and  its
return on capital had risen by more than onethird to 21

by any standard expeditors was a superb business but the little
freightforwarding  company  with  its  base  in  seattle  and  much  of  its
operations in asia was allbutunknown on wall street only 32 of
the  shares  were  owned  by  institutional  investors  in  fact  expeditors
had only 8500 shareholders after doubling in 1999 the stock was
priced at 39 times the net income expeditors would earn for the year
no longer anywhere near cheap but well below the vertiginous valua
tion of emc

blodget  of  merrill  lynch  were  predicting  that  the  stock  would  rise
another 25 to 125 over the coming year

and  best  of  all  in  the  eyes  of  the  online  traders  who  gorged  on
exoduss  gains  was  the  fact  that  the  stock  had  split  2for1  three
times  during  1999  in  a  2for1  stock  split  a  company  doubles  the
number of its shares and halves their priceso a shareholder ends up
owning  twice  as  many  shares  each  priced  at  half  the  former  level
what is so great about that imagine that you handed me a dime and
i  then  gave  you  back  two  nickels  and  asked  do not  you  feel  richer
now you would probably conclude either that i was an idiot or that i
had  mistaken  you  for  one  and  yet  in  1999s  frenzy  over  dotcom
stocks online traders acted exactly as if two nickels were more valu
able than one dime in fact just the news that a stock would be split
ting 2for1 could instantly drive its shares up 20 or more

why  because  getting  more  shares  makes  people  feel richer
someone who bought 100 shares of exodus in january watched them
turn into 200 when the stock split in april then those 200 turned into
400 in august then the 400 became 800 in december it was thrilling
for these people to realize that they had gotten 700 more shares just
for owning 100 in the first place to them that felt like found money
never  mind  that  the  price  per  share  had  been  cut  in  half  with  each
split4 in december 1999 one elated exodus shareholder who went
by  the  handle  givemeadollar  exulted  on  an  online  message  board
i am  going  to  hold  these  shares  until  i am  80  because  after  it  splits
hundreds  of  times  over  the  next  years  ill  be  close  to  becoming

month of december alone according to exoduss annual report that
new  borrowing  would  add  more  than  50  million  to  its  interest  pay
ments in the coming year the company started 1999 with 156 mil
lion  in  cash  and  even  after  raising  13  billion  in  new  financing
finished  the  year  with  a  cash  balance  of  1  billionmeaning  that  its
businesses  had  devoured  more  than  400  million  in  cash  during
1999 how could such a company ever pay its debts

but  of  course  online  traders  were  fixated  on  how  far  and  fast  the
stock had risen not on whether the company was healthy this stock
bragged a trader using the screen name of launchpad1999 will just
continue climbing to infinity and beyond 6

the absurdity of launchpads predictionwhat is beyond infin
ityis  the  perfect  reminder  of  one  of  grahams  classic  warnings
todays investor graham tells us

is  so  concerned  with  anticipating  the  future  that  he  is  already  paying
handsomely for it in advance thus what he has projected with so much
study and care may actually happen and still not bring him any profit if it
should fail to materialize to the degree expected he may in fact be faced
with a serious temporary and perhaps even permanent loss 7

chapter 14

stock selection for the defensive investor

it is time to turn to some broader applications of the techniques of
security analysis since we have already described in general terms
the  investment  policies  recommended  for  our  two  categories  of
investors it would be logical for us now to indicate how security
analysis comes into play in order to implement these policies the
defensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only
highgrade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks
he is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is
not unduly high as judged by applicable standards

in  setting  up  this  diversified  list  he  has  a  choice  of  two
approaches  the  djiatype  of  portfolio  and  the  quantitatively
tested portfolio in the first he acquires a true crosssection sample
of the leading issues which will include both some favored growth
companies  whose  shares  sell  at  especially  high  multipliers  and
also  less  popular  and  less  expensive  enterprises  this  could  be
done  most  simply  perhaps  by  buying  the  same  amounts  of  all
thirty of the issues in the dowjones industrial average djia ten
shares  of  each  at  the  900  level  for  the  average  would  cost  an
aggregate  of  about  160001 on  the  basis  of  the  past  record  he
might  expect  approximately  the  same  future  results  by  buying
shares of several representative investment funds

his second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each

 graham  describes  his  recommended  investment  policies  in  chapters  4
through 7
 as we have discussed in the commentaries on chapters 5 and 9 todays
defensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a lowcost index
fund ideally one that tracks the return of the total us stock market

347

348

the intelligent investor

purchase to make sure that he obtains 1 a minimum of quality in
the  past  performance  and  current  financial  position  of  the  com
pany and also 2 a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and
assets per dollar of price at the close of the previous chapter we
listed  seven  such  quality  and  quantity  criteria  suggested  for  the
selection of specific common stocks let us describe them in order

1 adequate size of the enterprise

all our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the
matter  of  size  required  our  idea  is  to  exclude  small  companies
which may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially
in  the  industrial  field  there  are  often  good  possibilities  in  such
enterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the
defensive investor let us use round amounts not less than 100
million of annual sales for an industrial company and not less than
50 million of total assets for a public utility

2 a sufficiently strong financial condition

for industrial companies current assets should be at least twice
current liabilitiesa socalled twotoone current ratio also long
term  debt  should  not  exceed  the  net  current  assets  or  working
capital for public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the
stock equity at book value

3 earnings stability

some  earnings  for  the  common  stock  in  each  of  the  past  ten

years

4 dividend record

uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years

5 earnings growth

a minimum increase of at least onethird in pershare earnings
in  the  past  ten  years  using  threeyear  averages  at  the  beginning
and end

stock selection for the defensive investor

349

6 moderate priceearnings ratio

current  price  should  not  be  more  than  15  times  average  earn

ings of the past three years

7 moderate ratio of price to assets

current price should not be more than 112 times the book value last
reported however a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a
correspondingly higher multiplier of assets as a rule of thumb we
suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to
book  value  should  not  exceed  225  this  figure  corresponds  to  15
times earnings and 112 times book value it would admit an issue sell
ing at only 9 times earnings and 25 times asset value etc

general comments these requirements are set up especially
for  the  needs  and  the  temperament  of  defensive  investors  they
will  eliminate  the  great  majority  of  common  stocks  as  candidates
for the portfolio and in two opposite ways on the one hand they
will exclude companies that are 1 too small 2 in relatively weak
financial  condition  3  with  a  deficit  stigma  in  their  tenyear
record and 4 not having a long history of continuous dividends
of these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are
those of financial strength a considerable number of our large and
formerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur
rent ratio or overexpanded their debt or both in recent years

our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction by
demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than
the  popular  issues  will  supply  this  is  by  no  means  the  standard
viewpoint  of  financial  analysts  in  fact  most  will  insist  that  even
conservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices
for  stocks  of  the  choice  companies  we  have  expounded  our  con
trary view above it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac
tor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on
everincreasing  earnings  in  the  future  the  reader  will  have  to
decide  this  important  question  for  himselfafter  weighing  the
arguments on both sides

we have  nonetheless  opted  for  the  inclusion  of  a  modest
requirement of growth over the past decade without it the typical
company would show retrogression at least in terms of profit per

350

the intelligent investor

dollar  of  invested  capital  there  is  no  reason  for  the  defensive
investor  to  include  such  companiesthough  if  the  price  is  low
enough they could qualify as bargain opportunities

the suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well
result in a typical portfolio with an average multiplier of say 12 to
13 times note that in february 1972 american tel  tel sold at 11
times  its  threeyear  and  current  earnings  and  standard  oil  of
california  at  less  than  10  times  latest  earnings  our  basic  recom
mendation is that the stock portfolio when acquired should have
an  overall  earningsprice  ratiothe  reverse  of  the  pe  ratioat
least as high as the current highgrade bond rate this would mean
a pe ratio no higher than 133 against an aa bond yield of 75

application of our criteria to the djia at the end of 1970

all of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the djia issues at
the end of 1970 but two of them just barely here is a survey based
on  the  closing  price  of  1970  and  the  relevant  figures  the  basic
data for each company are shown in tables 141 and 142

1 size is more than ample for each company
2 financial  condition  is  adequate  in  the  aggregate but  not  for

every company2

3 some dividend has been paid by every company since at least
1940 five of the dividend records go back to the last century

 in early 2003 the yield on 10year aarated corporate bonds was around
46 suggestingby grahams formulathat a stock portfolio should have
an earningstoprice ratio at least that high taking the inverse of that num
ber by dividing 46 into 100 we can derive a suggested maximum pe
ratio of 217 at the beginning of this paragraph graham recommends that
the average stock be priced about 20 below the maximum ratio that
suggests thatin generalgraham would consider stocks selling at no more
than 17 times their threeyear average earnings to be potentially attractive
given  todays  interest  rates  and  market  conditions  as  of  december  31
2002 more than 200or better than 40of the stocks in the s  p 500
stock index had threeyear average pe ratios of 170 or lower updated aa

the intelligent investor

4 the  aggregate  earnings  have  been  quite  stable  in  the  past
decade  none  of  the  companies  reported  a  deficit  during  the
prosperous  period  196169  but  chrysler  showed  a  small
deficit in 1970

5 the  total  growthcomparing  threeyear  averages  a  decade
apartwas 77 or about 6 per year but five of the firms did
not grow by onethird

6 the ratio of yearend price to threeyear average earnings was
839 to 555 or 15 to 1right at our suggested upper limit
7 the ratio of price to net asset value was 839 to 562also just

within our suggested limit of 112 to 1

if  however  we  wish  to  apply  the  same  seven  criteria  to  each
individual company we would find that only five of them would
meet all our requirements these would be american can ameri
can  tel    tel  anaconda  swift  and  woolworth  the  totals  for
these five appear in table 143 naturally they make a much better
statistical  showing  than  the  djia as  a  whole  except  in  the  past
growth rate3

our application of specific criteria to this select group of indus
trial  stocks  indicates  that  the  number  meeting  every  one  of  our
tests  will  be  a  relatively  small  percentage  of  all listed  industrial
issues we hazard the guess that about 100 issues of this sort could
have been found in the standard  poors stock guide at the end of
1970 just about enough to provide the investor with a satisfactory
range of personal choice

the publicutility solution

if  we  turn  now  to  the  field  of  publicutility  stocks  we  find  a
much  more  comfortable  and  inviting  situation  for  the  investor

 an easytouse online stock screener that can sort the stocks in the s  p
500  by  most  of  grahams  criteria  is  available  at  wwwquickencom

 when  graham  wrote  only  one  major  mutual  fund  specializing  in  utility
stocksfranklin  utilitieswas  widely  available  today  there  are  more  than
30 graham could not have anticipated the financial havoc wrought by can

the intelligent investor

here the vast majority of issues appear to be cut out by their per
formance  record  and  their  price  ratios  in  accordance  with  the
defensive investors needs as we judge them we exclude one crite
rion  from  our  tests  of  publicutility  stocksnamely  the  ratio  of
current assets to current liabilities the workingcapital factor takes
care of itself in this industry as part of the continuous financing of
its growth by sales of bonds and shares we do require an adequate
proportion of stock capital to debt4

in table 144 we present a resume of the 15 issues in the dow
jones  publicutility  average  for  comparison  table  145  gives  a
similar picture of a random selection of fifteen other utilities taken
from the new york stock exchange list

as  1972  began  the  defensive  investor  could  have  had  quite  a
wide choice of utility common stocks each of which would have
met our requirements for both performance and price these com
panies  offered  him  everything  he  had  a  right  to  demand  from 
simply  chosen  commonstock  investments  in  comparison  with
prominent industrial companies as represented by the djia they
offered almost as good a record of past growth plus smaller fluctu
ations  in  the  annual  figuresboth  at  a  lower  price  in  relation  to
earnings and assets the dividend return was significantly higher
the  position  of  the  utilities  as  regulated  monopolies  is  assuredly
more  of  an  advantage  than  a  disadvantage  for  the  conservative
investor  under  law  they  are  entitled  to  charge  rates  sufficiently
remunerative  to  attract  the  capital  they  need  for  their  continuous
expansion  and  this  implies  adequate  offsets  to  inflated  costs
while  the  process  of  regulation  has  often  been  cumbersome  and
perhaps  dilatory  it  has  not  prevented  the  utilities  from  earning  a
fair return on their rising invested capital over many decades

celed  and  decommissioned  nuclear  energy  plants  nor  did  he  foresee  the
consequences  of  bungled  regulation  in  california  utility  stocks  are  vastly
more  volatile  than  they  were  in  grahams  day  and  most  investors  should
own them only through a welldiversified lowcost fund like the dow jones
us utilities sector index fund ticker symbol idu or utilities select sec
tor  spdr  xlu  for  more  information  see  wwwisharescom  and  www
spdrindexcomspdr be sure your broker will not charge commissions to
reinvest your dividends

stock selection for the defensive investor

359

for the defensive investor the central appeal of the publicutility
stocks at this time should be their availability at a moderate price
in relation to book value this means that he can ignore stockmar
ket considerations if he wishes and consider himself primarily as
a part owner of wellestablished and wellearning businesses the
market  quotations  are  always  there  for  him  to  take  advantage  of
when  times  are  propitiouseither  for  purchases  at  unusually
attractive low levels or for sales when their prices seem definitely
too high

the  market  record  of  the  publicutility  indexescondensed  in
table 146 along with those of other groupsindicates that there
have been ample possibilities of profit in these investments in the
past while the rise has not been as great as in the industrial index
the  individual  utilities  have  shown  more  price  stability  in  most
periods  than  have  other  groups  it  is  striking  to  observe  in  this
table  that  the  relative  priceearnings  ratios  of  the  industrials  and
the  utilities  have  changed  places  during  the  past  two  decades

the intelligent investor

these reversals will have more meaning for the active than for the
passive  investor  but  they  suggest  that  even  defensive  portfolios
should  be  changed  from  time  to  time  especially  if  the  securities
purchased  have  an  apparently  excessive  advance  and  can  be
replaced by issues much more reasonably priced alas there will
be capitalgains taxes to paywhich for the typical investor seems
to be about the same as the devil to pay our old ally experience
tells us here that it is better to sell and pay the tax than not sell and
repent

investing in stocks of financial enterprises

a considerable  variety  of  concerns  may  be  ranged  under  the
rubric  of  financial  companies  these  would  include  banks 
insurance  companies  savings  and  loan  associations  credit  and
smallloan  companies  mortgage  companies  and  investment
companies  eg  mutual  funds  it  is  characteristic  of  all  these
enterprises that they have a relatively small part of their assets in
the form of material thingssuch as fixed assets and merchandise
inventoriesbut  on  the  other  hand  most  categories  have  short
term obligations well in excess of their stock capital the question
of financial soundness is therefore more relevant here than in the
case  of  the  typical  manufacturing  or  commercial  enterprise  this
in turn has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervi
sion  with  the  design  and  general  result  of  assuring  against
unsound financial practices

broadly  speaking  the  shares  of  financial  concerns  have  pro
duced investment results similar to those of other types of common
shares table 147 shows price changes between 1948 and 1970 in
six  groups  represented  in  the  standard    poors  stockprice
indexes  the  average  for  19411943  is  taken  as  10  the  base  level

 today the financialservices industry is made up of even more components
including commercial banks savings  loan and mortgagefinancing compa
nies consumerfinance firms like creditcard issuers money managers and
trust companies investment banks and brokerages insurance companies
and firms engaged in developing or owning real estate including realestate
investment  trusts  although  the  sector  is  much  more  diversified  today
grahams caveats about financial soundness apply more than ever

the yearend 1970 figures ranged between 443 for the 9 new york
banks  and  218  for  the  11  lifeinsurance  stocks  during  the  sub
intervals  there  was  considerable  variation  in  the  respective  price
movements for example the new york city bank stocks did quite
well  between  1958  and  1968  conversely  the  spectacular  life
insurance  group  actually  lost  ground  between  1963  and  1968
these  crossmovements  are  found  in  many  perhaps  most  of  the
numerous industry groups in the standard  poors indexes

we have no very helpful remarks to offer in this broad area of
investmentother than to counsel that the same arithmetical stan
dards for price in relation to earnings and book value be applied to
the choice of companies in these groups as we have suggested for
industrial and publicutility investments

railroad issues

the railroad story is a far different one from that of the utilities
the  carriers  have  suffered  severely  from  a  combination  of  severe
competition and strict regulation their laborcost problem has of

362

the intelligent investor

course been difficult as well but that has not been confined to rail
roads  automobiles  buses  and  airlines  have  drawn  off  most  of
their  passenger  business  and  left  the  rest  highly  unprofitable  the
trucks have taken a good deal of their freight traffic more than half
of the railroad mileage of the country has been in bankruptcy or
trusteeship at various times during the past 50 years

but this halfcentury has not been all downhill for the carriers
there have been prosperous periods for the industry especially the
war years some of the lines have managed to maintain their earn
ing power and their dividends despite the general difficulties

the standard  poors index advanced sevenfold from the low
of 1942 to the high of 1968 not much below the percentage gain in
the publicutility index the bankruptcy of the penn central trans
portation  co  our  most  important  railroad  in  1970  shocked  the
financial  world  only  a  year  and  two  years  previously  the  stock
sold at close to the highest price level in its long history and it had
paid  continuous  dividends  for  more  than  120  years  on  p  423
below we present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a
competent student could have detected the developing weaknesses
in  the  companys  picture  and  counseled  against  ownership  of  its
securities the market level of railroad shares as a whole was seri
ously affected by this financial disaster

it  is  usually  unsound  to  make  blanket  recommendations  of
whole classes of securities and there are equal objections to broad
condemnations  the  record  of  railroad  share  prices  in  table  146
shows  that  the  group  as  a  whole  has  often  offered  chances  for  a
large  profit  but  in  our  view  the  great  advances  were  in  them
selves largely unwarranted let us confine our suggestion to this
there  is  no  compelling  reason  for  the  investor  to  own  railroad
shares before he buys any he should make sure that he is getting
so much value for his money that it would be unreasonable to look
for something else instead

 only  a  few  major  rail  stocks  now  remain  including  burlington  northern
csx norfolk southern and union pacific the advice in this section is at
least  as  relevant  to  airline  stocks  todaywith  their  massive  current  losses
and a halfcentury of almost incessantly poor resultsas it was to railroads
in grahams day

stock selection for the defensive investor

363

selectivity for the defensive investor

every investor would like his list to be better or more promising
than the average hence the reader will ask whether if he gets him
self a competent adviser or security analyst he should not be able to
count on being supplied with an investment package of really supe
rior merits after all he may say the rules you have outlined are
pretty simple and easygoing a highly trained analyst ought to be
able to use all his skill and techniques to improve substantially on
something as obvious as the dow jones list if not what good are all
his statistics calculations and pontifical judgments

suppose  as  a  practical  test  we  had  asked  a  hundred  security
analysts to choose the best five stocks in the dow jones average
to  be  bought  at  the  end  of  1970  few  would  have  come  up  with
identical  choices  and  many  of  the  lists  would  have  differed  com
pletely from each other

this is not so surprising as it may at first appear the underlying
reason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well
reflects  the  salient  factors  in  its  financial  record  plus  the  general
opinion as to its future prospects hence the view of any analyst that
one stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent
from his personal partialities and expectations or from the placing
of his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his
work of evaluation if all analysts were agreed that one particular
stock was better than all the rest that issue would quickly advance
to a price which would offset all of its previous advantages

 graham is summarizing the efficient markets hypothesis or emh an aca
demic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly
available information about the company with millions of investors scouring
the  market  every  day  it  is  unlikely  that  severe  mispricings  can  persist  for
long  an  old  joke  has  two  finance  professors  walking  along  the  sidewalk
when one spots a 20 bill and bends over to pick it up the other grabs his
arm and says do not bother if it was really a 20 bill someone would have
taken it already while the market is not perfectly efficient it is pretty close
most of the timeso the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock
markets 20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the
costs of trading and taxes

364

the intelligent investor

our  statement  that  the  current  price  reflects  both  known  facts
and  future  expectations  was  intended  to  emphasize  the  double
basis  for  market  valuations  corresponding  with  these  two  kinds
of value elements are two basically different approaches to security
analysis to be sure every competent analyst looks forward to the
future  rather  than  backward  to  the  past  and  he  realizes  that  his
work will prove good or bad depending on what will happen and
not  on  what  has happened  nevertheless  the  future  itself  can  be
approached in two different ways which may be called the way of
prediction or projection and the way of protection

those  who  emphasize  prediction  will  endeavor  to  anticipate
fairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future
yearsin particular whether earnings will show pronounced and
persistent growth these conclusions may be based on a very care
ful study of such factors as supply and demand in the industryor
volume  price  and  costsor  else  they  may  be  derived  from  a
rather naive projection of the line of past growth into the future if
these authorities are convinced that the fairly longterm prospects
are  unusually  favorable  they  will  almost  always  recommend  the
stock for purchase without paying too much regard to the level at
which it is selling such for example was the general attitude with
respect  to  the  airtransport  stocksan  attitude  that  persisted  for
many years despite the distressingly bad results often shown after
1946  in  the  introduction  we  have  commented  on  the  disparity
between  the  strong  price  action  and  the  relatively  disappointing
earnings record of this industry

 this  is  one  of  the  central  points  of  grahams  book  all  investors  labor
under a cruel irony we invest in the present but we invest for the future
and unfortunately the future is almost entirely uncertain inflation and inter
est rates are undependable economic recessions come and go at random
geopolitical  upheavals  like  war  commodity  shortages  and  terrorism  arrive
without  warning  and  the  fate  of  individual  companies  and  their  industries
often turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect therefore
investing on the basis of projection is a fools errand even the forecasts of
the socalled experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin for most peo
ple  investing  on  the  basis  of  protectionfrom  overpaying  for  a  stock  and
from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgmentis the best solu
tion graham expands on this concept in chapter 20

stock selection for the defensive investor

365

by  contrast  those  who  emphasize  protection  are  always  espe
cially  concerned  with  the  price  of  the  issue  at  the  time  of  study
their main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of
indicated  present  value  above  the  market  pricewhich  margin
could  absorb  unfavorable  developments  in  the  future  generally
speaking therefore it is not so necessary for them to be enthusias
tic over the companys longrun prospects as it is to be reasonably
confident that the enterprise will get along

the first or predictive approach could also be called the quali
tative  approach  since  it  emphasizes  prospects  management  and
other  nonmeasurable  albeit  highly  important  factors  that  go
under the heading of quality the second or protective approach
may  be  called  the  quantitative  or  statistical  approach  since  it
emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and
earnings assets dividends and so forth incidentally the quantita
tive  method  is  really  an  extensioninto  the  field  of  common
stocksof  the  viewpoint  that  security  analysis  has  found  to  be
sound  in  the  selection  of  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  for  invest
ment

in  our  own  attitude  and  professional  work  we  were  always
committed to the quantitative approach from the first we wanted
to make sure that we were getting ample value for our money in
concrete  demonstrable  terms  we  were  not  willing  to  accept  the
prospects and promises of the future as compensation for a lack of
sufficient value in hand this has by no means been the standard
viewpoint  among  investment  authorities  in  fact  the  majority
would  probably  subscribe  to  the  view  that  prospects  quality  of
management  other  intangibles  and  the  human  factor  far  out
weigh the indications supplied by any study of the past record the
balance sheet and all the other cold figures

thus  this  matter  of  choosing  the  best  stocks  is  at  bottom  a
highly  controversial  one  our  advice  to  the  defensive  investor  is
that  he  let  it  alone  let  him  emphasize  diversification  more  than
individual selection incidentally the universally accepted idea of
diversification is in part at least the negation of the ambitious pre
tensions of selectivity if one could select the best stocks unerringly
one  would  only  lose  by  diversifying  yet  within  the  limits  of  the
four  most  general  rules  of  commonstock  selection  suggested  for
the  defensive  investor  on  pp  114115  there  is  room  for  a  rather
considerable freedom of preference at the worst the indulgence of

366

the intelligent investor

such  preferences  should  do  no  harm  beyond  that  it  may  add
something worthwhile to the results with the increasing impact of
technological  developments  on  longterm  corporate  results  the
investor  cannot  leave  them  out  of  his  calculations  here  as  else
where he must seek a mean between neglect and overemphasis

how  should  you  tackle  the  nittygritty  work  of  stock  selection  gra
ham suggests that the defensive investor can most simply buy every
stock in the dowjones industrial average todays defensive investor
can  do  even  betterby  buying  a  total  stockmarket  index  fund  that
holds  essentially  every  stock  worth  having  a  lowcost  index  fund  is
the  best  tool  ever  created  for  lowmaintenance  stock  investingand
any effort to improve on it takes more work and incurs more risk and
higher costs than a truly defensive investor can justify

researching  and  selecting  your  own  stocks  is  not  necessary  for
most  people  it  is  not  even  advisable  however  some  defensive
investors do enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking
individual  stocksand  if  you  have  survived  a  bear  market  and  still
enjoy stock picking then nothing that graham or i could say will dis
suade you in that case instead of making a total stock market index
fund your complete portfolio make it the foundation of your portfolio
once you have that foundation in place you can experiment around
the  edges  with  your  own  stock  choices  keep  90  of  your  stock
money  in  an  index  fund  leaving  10  with  which  to  try  picking  your
own  stocks  only  after  you  build  that  solid  core  should  you  explore

during the bull market of the 1990s one of the most common
criticisms of diversification was that it lowers your potential for
high  returns  after  all  if  you  could  identify  the  next  microsoft
would not it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one
basket

well  sure  as  the  humorist  will  rogers  once  said  do not
gamble  take  all  your  savings  and  buy  some  good  stock  and
hold it till it goes up then sell it if it do not go up do not buy it

however  as  rogers  knew  2020  foresight  is  not  a  gift
granted  to  most  investors  no  matter  how  confident  we  feel
there is no way to find out whether a stock will go up until after
we  buy  it  therefore  the  stock  you  think  is  the  next  micro
soft  may  well  turn  out  to  be  the  next  microstrategy  instead
that former market star went from 3130 per share in march
2000  to  1510  at  yearend  2002  an  apocalyptic  loss  of
9951 keeping your money spread across many stocks and
industries is the only reliable insurance against the risk of being
wrong

but  diversification  does not  just  minimize  your  odds  of  being
wrong it also maximizes your chances of being right over long
periods of time a handful of stocks turn into superstocks that
go  up  10000  or  more  money magazine  identified  the  30
bestperforming stocks over the 30 years ending in 2002and
even  with  2020  hindsight  the  list  is  startlingly  unpredictable
rather than lots of technology or healthcare stocks it includes
southwest airlines worthington steel dollar general discount
stores  and  snufftobacco  maker  ust  inc2 if  you  think  you
would have been willing to bet big on any of those stocks back
in 1972 you are kidding yourself

think of it this way in the huge market haystack only a few
needles ever go on to generate truly gigantic gains the more of
the haystack you own the higher the odds go that you will end
up finding at least one of those needles by owning the entire
haystack ideally through an index fund that tracks the total us
stock market you can be sure to find every needle thus captur

let us briefly update grahams criteria for stock selection

adequate  size nowadays  to  exclude  small  companies  most
defensive investors should steer clear of stocks with a total market value
of less than 2 billion in early 2003 that still left you with 437 of the
companies in the standard  poors 500stock index to choose from

however todays defensive investorsunlike those in grahams day
can conveniently own small companies by buying a mutual fund special
izing in small stocks again an index fund like vanguard smallcap index
is the first choice although active funds are available at reasonable cost
from such firms as ariel t rowe price royce and third avenue

strong financial condition according to market strategists steve
galbraith and jay lasus of morgan stanley at the beginning of 2003
about  120  of  the  companies  in  the  s    p  500  index  met  grahams
test of a 2to1 current ratio with current assets at least twice their
current liabilities these firms had a sizeable cushion of working capital
thaton averageshould sustain them through hard times

wall street has always abounded in bitter ironies and the bursting
of the growthstock bubble has created a doozy in 1999 and 2000
hightech biotech and telecommunications stocks were supposed to
provide  aggressive  growth  and  ended  up  giving  most  of  their
investors aggressive shrinkage instead but by early 2003 the wheel
had come full circle and many of those aggressive growth stocks had
become  financially  conservativeloaded  with  working  capital  rich  in
cash and often debtfree this table provides a sampler

the lesson here is not that these stocks were a sure thing or that
you  should  rush  out  and  buy  everything  or  anything  in  this  table1
instead you should realize that a defensive investor can always pros
per  by  looking  patiently  and  calmly  through  the  wreckage  of  a  bear
market grahams criterion of financial strength still works if you build
a diversified basket of stocks whose current assets are at least double
their  current  liabilities  and  whose  longterm  debt  does  not  exceed
working  capital  you  should  end  up  with  a  group  of  conservatively
financed  companies  with  plenty  of  staying  power  the  best  values
today are often found in the stocks that were once hot and have since
gone  cold  throughout  history  such  stocks  have  often  provided  the
margin of safety that a defensive investor demands

earnings  stability according  to  morgan  stanley  86  of  all  the
companies in the s  p 500 index have had positive earnings in every
year  from  1993  through  2002  so  grahams  insistence  on  some
earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years remains
a  valid  testtough  enough  to  eliminate  chronic  losers  but  not  so
restrictive as to limit your choices to an unrealistically small sample

dividend  record as  of  early  2003  according  to  standard  
poors 354 companies in the s  p 500 or 71 of the total paid a
dividend  no  fewer  than  255  companies  have  paid  a  dividend  for  at
least 20 years in a row and according to s  p 57 companies in the
index  have  raised their  dividends  for  at  least  25  consecutive  years
that is  no  guarantee  that  they  will  do  so  forever  but  its  a  comfort
ing sign

earnings  growth how  many  companies  in  the  s    p  500
increased their earnings per share by at least one third as graham
requires  over  the  10  years  ending  in  2002  well  average  each
companys  earnings  from  1991  through  1993  and  then  determine
whether the average earnings from 2000 through 2002 were at least
33  higher  according  to  morgan  stanley  264  companies  in  the 
s  p 500 met that test but here it seems graham set a very low
hurdle 33 cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3 aver
age  annual  increase  cumulative  growth  in  earnings  per  share  of  at
least 50or a 4 average annual riseis a bit less conservative no

fewer than 245 companies in the s  p 500 index met that criterion as
of early 2003 leaving the defensive investor an ample list to choose
from  if  you  double  the  cumulative  growth  hurdle  to  100  or  7
average annual growth then 198 companies make the cutoff

moderate  pe  ratio graham  recommends  limiting  yourself  to
stocks whose current price is no more than 15 times average earnings
over  the  past  three  years  incredibly  the  prevailing  practice  on  wall
street today is to value stocks by dividing their current price by some
thing  called  next  years  earnings  that  gives  what  is  sometimes
called  the  forward  pe  ratio  but  its  nonsensical  to  derive  a
priceearnings ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown
future earnings over the long run money manager david dreman has
shown 59 of wall streets consensus earnings forecasts miss the
mark by a mortifyingly wide margineither underestimating or overesti
mating the actual reported earnings by at least 152 investing your
money on the basis of what these myopic soothsayers predict for the
coming year is as risky as volunteering to hold up the bullseye at an
archery  tournament  for  the  legally  blind  instead  calculate  a  stocks
priceearnings ratio yourself using grahams formula of current price
divided by average earnings over the past three years3

as of early 2003 how many stocks in the standard  poors 500
index were valued at no more than 15 times their average earnings of
2000 through 2002 according to morgan stanley a generous total
of 185 companies passed grahams test

moderate  pricetobook  ratio graham  recommends  a  ratio  of
price to assets or pricetobookvalue ratio of no more than 15 in
recent years an increasing proportion of the value of companies has
come from intangible assets like franchises brand names and patents
and trademarks since these factors along with goodwill from acqui
sitions are excluded from the standard definition of book value most
companies today are priced at higher pricetobook multiples than in
grahams day according to morgan stanley 123 of the companies in
the s  p 500 or one in four are priced below 15 times book value

2 david dreman bubbles and the role of analysts forecasts the journal
of psychology and financial markets vol 3 no 1 2002 pp 414

obtain  the  data  at  websites  like  wwwmorningstarcom  or  httpfinance
yahoocom

commentary on chapter 14

375

all  told  273  companies  or  55  of  the  index  have  pricetobook
ratios of less than 25

what about grahams suggestion that you multiply the pe ratio by
the pricetobook ratio and see whether the resulting number is below
225 based on data from morgan stanley at least 142 stocks in the
s    p  500  could  pass  that  test  as  of  early  2003  including  dana
corp electronic data systems sun microsystems and washington
mutual  so  grahams  blended  multiplier  still  works  as  an  initial
screen to identify reasonablypriced stocks

d you e   d i l i g e n c e

no  matter  how  defensive  an  investor  you  arein  grahams  sense  of
wishing to minimize the work you put into picking stocksthere are a
couple of steps you cannot afford to skip

do your homework through the edgar database at wwwsec
gov  you  get  instant  access  to  a  companys  annual  and  quarterly
reports along with the proxy statement that discloses the managers
compensation ownership and potential conflicts of interest read at
least five years worth4

check  out  the  neighborhood websites  like  httpquicktake
morningstarcom httpfinanceyahoocom and wwwquickencom can
readily tell you what percentage of a companys shares are owned by
institutions  anything  over  60  suggests  that  a  stock  is  scarcely
undiscovered  and  probably  overowned  when  big  institutions  sell
they  tend  to  move  in  lockstep  with  disastrous  results  for  the  stock
imagine all the radio city rockettes toppling off the front edge of the
stage at once and you get the idea those websites will also tell you
who  the  largest  owners  of  the  stock  are  if  they  are  money
management  firms  that  invest  in  a  style  similar  to  your  own  that is  a
good sign

4 for more on what to look for see the commentary on chapters 11 12 and
19 if you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of reading the proxy and
making  basic  comparisons  of  financial  health  across  five  years  worth  of
annual reports then you are too defensive to be buying individual stocks at
all  get  yourself  out  of  the  stockpicking  business  and  into  an  index  fund
where you belong

chapter 15

stock selection for the enterprising investor

in the previous chapter we have dealt with commonstock selec
tion in terms of broad groups of eligible securities from which the
defensive investor is free to make up any list that he or his adviser
prefers provided adequate diversification is achieved our empha
sis in selection has been chiefly on exclusionsadvising on the one
hand  against  all  issues  of  recognizably  poor  quality  and  on  the
other against the highestquality issues if their price is so high as to
involve a considerable speculative risk in this chapter addressed
to the enterprising investor we must consider the possibilities and
the means of making individual selections which are likely to prove
more profitable than an acrosstheboard average

what are the prospects of doing this successfully we would be
less than frank as the euphemism goes if we did not at the outset
express  some  grave  reservations  on  this  score  at  first  blush  the
case  for  successful  selection  appears  selfevident  to  get  average
resultseg  equivalent  to  the  performance  of  the  djiashould
require no special ability of any kind all that is needed is a portfo
lio  identical  with  or  similar  to  those  thirty  prominent  issues
surely  then  by  the  exercise  of  even  a  moderate  degree  of  skill
derived  from  study  experience  and  native  abilityit  should  be
possible to obtain substantially better results than the djia

yet  there  is  considerable  and  impressive  evidence  to  the  effect
that this is very hard to do even though the qualifications of those
trying  it  are  of  the  highest  the  evidence  lies  in  the  record  of  the
numerous investment companies or funds which have been in
operation for many years most of these funds are large enough to
command the services of the best financial or security analysts in
the  field  together  with  all  the  other  constituents  of  an  adequate
research  department  their  expenses  of  operation  when  spread

over  their  ample  capital  average  about  onehalf  of  1  a  year
thereon  or  less  these  costs  are  not  negligible  in  themselves  but
when they are compared with the approximately 15 annual over
all  return  on  common  stocks  generally  in  the  decade  19511960
and  even  the  6  return  in  19611970  they  do  not  bulk  large  a
small amount of superior selective ability should easily have over
come  that  expense  handicap  and  brought  in  a  superior  net  result
for the fund shareholders

taken  as  a  whole  however  the  allcommonstock  funds  failed
over  a  long  span  of  years  to  earn  quite  as  good  a  return  as  was
shown on standard  poors 500stock averages or the market as a
whole this conclusion has been substantiated by several compre
hensive  studies  to  quote  the  latest  one  before  us  covering  the
period 19601968

it  appears  from  these  results  that  random  portfolios  of  new
york  stock  exchange  stocks  with  equal  investment  in  each  stock
performed on the average better over the period than did mutual
funds in the same risk class the differences were fairly substantial
for  the  low  and  mediumrisk  portfolios  37  and  25  respec
tively  per  annum  but  quite  small  for  the  highrisk  portfolios
02 per annum1

as we pointed out in chapter 9 these comparative figures in no
way invalidate the usefulness of the investment funds as a finan
cial  institution  for  they  do  make  available  to  all  members  of  the

 the friendblumecrockett research covered january 1960 through june
1968 and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual funds
against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more than 500
of  the  largest  stocks  listed  on  the  nyse  the  funds  in  the  friendblume
crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had in the first half
of  the  measurement  period  much  as  graham  found  in  his  own  research
see above pp 158 and 229232 but that improvement did not last and
the thrust of these studiesthat mutual funds on average underperform the
market  by  a  margin  roughly  equal  to  their  operating  expenses  and  trading
costshas been reconfirmed so many times that anyone who doubts them

investing public the possibility of obtaining approximately average
results on their commonstock commitments for a variety of rea
sons most members of the public who put their money in common
stocks of their own choice fail to do nearly as well but to the objec
tive  observer  the  failure  of  the  funds  to  better  the  performance 
of  a  broad  average  is  a  pretty  conclusive  indication  that  such  an
achievement instead of being easy is in fact extremely difficult

why should this be so we can think of two different explana
tions  each  of  which  may  be  partially  applicable  the  first  is  the
possibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current
prices  not  only  all  the  important  facts  about  the  companies  past
and  current  performance  but  also  whatever  expectations  can  be
reasonably formed as to their future if this is so then the diverse
market movements which subsequently take placeand these are
often extrememust be the result of new developments and prob
abilities that could not be reliably foreseen this would make the
price movements essentially fortuitous and random to the extent
that the foregoing is true the work of the security analysthow
ever intelligent and thoroughmust be largely ineffective because
in essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable

the very multiplication of the number of security analysts may
have played an important part in bringing about this result with
hundreds  even  thousands  of  experts  studying  the  value  factors
behind an important common stock it would be natural to expect
that  its  current  price  would  reflect  pretty  well  the  consensus  of
informed opinion on its value those who would prefer it to other
issues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism
that could just as well be wrong as right

we have often thought of the analogy between the work of the
host  of  security  analysts  on  wall  street  and  the  performance  of
master  bridge  players  at  a  duplicatebridge  tournament  the  for
mer try to pick the stocks most likely to succeed the latter to get
top score for each hand played only a limited few can accomplish
either aim to the extent that all the bridge players have about the
same level of expertness the winners are likely to be determined
by  breaks  of  various  sorts  rather  than  superior  skill  on  wall
street the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that
exists  in  the  profession  under  which  ideas  and  discoveries  are
quite freely shared at the numerous gettogethers of various sorts

it is almost as if at the analogous bridge tournament the various
experts were looking over each others shoulders and arguing out
each hand as it was played

the second possibility is of a quite different sort perhaps many
of  the  security  analysts  are  handicapped  by  a  flaw  in  their  basic
approach  to  the  problem  of  stock  selection  they  seek  the  indus
tries with the best prospects of growth and the companies in these
industries  with  the  best  management  and  other  advantages  the
implication is that they will buy into such industries and such com
panies at any price however high and they will avoid less promis
ing industries and companies no matter how low the price of their
shares this would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of
the good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely
in the future for then in theory their value would be infinite and
if  the  less  promising  companies  were  headed  for  extinction  with
no salvage the analysts would be right to consider them unattrac
tive at any price

the  truth  about  our  corporate  ventures  is  quite  otherwise
extremely  few  companies  have  been  able  to  show  a  high  rate  of
uninterrupted  growth  for  long  periods  of  time  remarkably  few
also of the larger companies suffer ultimate extinction for most
their history is one of vicissitudes of ups and downs of change in
their relative standing in some the variations from rags to riches
and  back  have  been  repeated  on  almost  a  cyclical  basisthe
phrase used to be a standard one applied to the steel industryfor
others spectacular changes have been identified with deterioration
or improvement of management

how  does  the  foregoing  inquiry  apply  to  the  enterprising
investor  who  would  like  to  make  individual  selections  that  will
yield superior results it suggests first of all that he is taking on a

 as we discuss in the commentary on chapter 9 there are several other
reasons  mutual  funds  have  not  been  able  to  outperform  the  market  aver
ages  including  the  low  returns  on  the  funds  cash  balances  and  the  high
costs of researching and trading stocks also a fund holding 120 compa
nies a typical number can trail the s  p 500stock index if any of the other
380 companies  in  that  benchmark  turns  out  to  be  a  great  performer  the
fewer stocks a fund owns the more likely it is to miss the next microsoft

the intelligent investor

difficult  and  perhaps  impracticable  assignment  readers  of  this
book  however  intelligent  and  knowing  could  scarcely  expect  to
do  a  better  job  of  portfolio  selection  than  the  top  analysts  of  the
country but if it is true that a fairly large segment of the stock mar
ket is often discriminated against or entirely neglected in the stan
dard analytical selections then the intelligent investor may be in a
position to profit from the resultant undervaluations

but to do so he must follow specific methods that are not gener
ally accepted on wall street since those that are so accepted do not
seem  to  produce  the  results  everyone  would  like  to  achieve  it
would be rather strange ifwith all the brains at work profession
ally in the stock marketthere could be approaches which are both
sound and relatively unpopular yet our own career and reputation
have been based on this unlikely fact

a summary of the grahamnewman methods

to give  concreteness  to  the  last  statement  it  should  be  worth
while to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged
in  during  the  thirtyyear  life  of  grahamnewman  corporation
between  1926  and  1956  these  were  classified  in  our  records  as
follows

arbitrages the purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale

 in this section as he did also on pp 363364 graham is summarizing the
efficient market hypothesis recent appearances to the contrary the prob
lem  with  the  stock  market  today  is  not  that  so  many  financial  analysts  are
idiots  but  rather  that  so  many  of  them  are  so  smart  as  more  and  more
smart  people  search  the  market  for  bargains  that  very  act  of  searching
makes those bargains rarerand in a cruel paradox makes the analysts look
as if they lack the intelligence to justify the search the markets valuation of
a given stock is the result of a vast continuous realtime operation of col
lective intelligence most of the time for most stocks that collective intelli
gence  gets  the  valuation  approximately  right  only  rarely  does  grahams
mr market see chapter 8 send prices wildly out of whack
 graham launched grahamnewman corp in january 1936 and dissolved
it when he retired from active money management in 1956 it was the suc
cessor to a partnership called the benjamin graham joint account which
he ran from january 1926 through december 1935

of one or more other securities into which it was to be exchanged
under a plan of reorganization merger or the like

liquidations purchase  of  shares  which  were  to  receive  one  or

more cash payments in liquidation of the companys assets

operations of these two classes were selected on the twin basis
of a a calculated annual return of 20 or more and b our judg
ment that the chance of a successful outcome was at least four out
of five

related hedges the purchase of convertible bonds or convertible
preferred  shares  and  the  simultaneous  sale  of  the  common  stock
into which they were exchangeable the position was established
at close to a parity basisie at a small maximum loss if the senior
issue had actually to be converted and the operation closed out in
that way but a profit would be made if the common stock fell con
siderably more than the senior issue and the position closed out in
the market

netcurrentasset  or  bargain  issues the  idea  here  was  to
acquire  as  many  issues  as  possible  at  a  cost  for  each  of  less  than
their  book  value  in  terms  of  netcurrentassets  aloneie  giving
no value to the plant account and other assets our purchases were
made  typically  at  twothirds  or  less  of  such  strippeddown  asset
value  in  most  years  we  carried  a  wide  diversification  hereat
least 100 different issues

we should add that from time to time we had some largescale
acquisitions  of  the  control  type  but  these  are  not  relevant  to  the
present discussion

we kept close track of the results shown by each class of opera
tion  in  consequence  of  these  followups  we  discontinued  two
broader  fields  which  were  found  not  to  have  shown  satisfactory
overall results the first was the purchase of apparently attractive
issuesbased on our general analysiswhich were not obtainable
at  less  than  their  workingcapital  value  alone  the  second  were
unrelated  hedging  operations  in  which  the  purchased  security
was  not  exchangeable  for  the  common  shares  sold  such  opera
tions  correspond  roughly  to  those  recently  embarked  on  by  the
new group of hedge funds in the investmentcompany field in

 an unrelated hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by one com
pany and shortselling or betting on a decline in a security issued by a dif

382

the intelligent investor

both cases a study of the results realized by us over a period of ten
years  or  more  led  us  to  conclude  that  the  profits  were  not  suffi
ciently dependableand the operations not sufficiently headache
proofto justify our continuing them

hence  from  1939  on  our  operations  were  limited  to  self
liquidating  situations  related  hedges  workingcapital  bargains
and  a  few  control  operations  each  of  these  classes  gave  us  quite
consistently satisfactory results from then on with the special fea
ture that the related hedges turned in good profits in the bear mar
kets when our undervalued issues were not doing so well

we hesitate  to  prescribe  our  own  diet  for  any  large  number  of
intelligent  investors  obviously  the  professional  techniques  we
have followed are not suitable for the defensive investor who by
definition  is  an  amateur  as  for  the  aggressive  investor  perhaps
only a small minority of them would have the type of temperament
needed  to  limit  themselves  so  severely  to  only  a  relatively  small
part  of  the  world  of  securities  most  activeminded  practitioners
would prefer to venture into wider channels their natural hunting
grounds  would  be  the  entire  field  of  securities  that  they  felt  a
were  certainly  not  overvalued  by  conservative  measures  and  b
appeared decidedly more attractivebecause of their prospects or
past  record  or  boththan  the  average  common  stock  in  such
choices  they  would  do  well  to  apply  various  tests  of  quality  and
pricereasonableness  along  the  lines  we  have  proposed  for  the
defensive investor but they should be less inflexible permitting a
considerable  plus  in  one  factor  to  offset  a  small  black  mark  in
another for example he might not rule out a company which had
shown a deficit in a year such as 1970 if large average earnings and
other  important  attributes  made  the  stock  look  cheap  the  enter
prising  investor  may  confine  his  choice  to  industries  and  compa
nies  about  which  he  holds  an  optimistic  view  but  we  counsel
strongly against paying a high price for a stock in relation to earn

ferent  company  a  related  hedge  involves  buying  and  selling  different
stocks or bonds issued by the same company the new group of hedge
funds  described  by  graham  were  widely  available  around  1968  but  later
regulation by the us securities and exchange commission restricted ac
cess to hedge funds for the general public

ings  and  assets  because  of  such  enthusiasm  if  he  followed  our
philosophy  in  this  field  he  would  more  likely  be  the  buyer  of
important  cyclical  enterprisessuch  as  steel  shares  perhaps
when the current situation is unfavorable the nearterm prospects
are poor and the low price fully reflects the current pessimism

secondary companies

next in order for examination and possible selection would come
secondary companies that are making a good showing have a satis
factory  past  record  but  appear  to  hold  no  charm  for  the  public
these  would  be  enterprises  on  the  order  of  eltra and  emhart  at
their 1970 closing prices see chapter 13 above there are various
ways of going about locating such companies we should like to try
a novel approach here and give a reasonably detailed exposition of
one such exercise in stock selection ours is a double purpose many
of our readers may find a substantial practical value in the method
we shall follow or it may suggest comparable methods to try out
beyond that what we shall do may help them to come to grips with
the real world of common stocks and introduce them to one of the
most fascinating and valuable little volumes in existence it is stan
dard  poors stock guide published monthly and made available
to the general public under annual subscription in addition many
brokerage firms distribute the guide to their clients on request

the great bulk of the guide is given over to about 230 pages of
condensed statistical information on the stocks of more than 4500
companies  these  include  all  the  issues  listed  on  the  various
exchanges say 3000 plus some 1500 unlisted issues most of the
items needed for a first and even a second look at a given company
appear  in  this  compendium  from  our  viewpoint  the  important
missing  datum  is  the  netassetvalue  or  book  value  per  share
which can be found in the larger standard  poors volumes and
elsewhere

 in 2003 an intelligent investor following grahams train of thought would
be searching for opportunities in the technology telecommunications and

the  investor  who  likes  to  play  around  with  corporate  figures
will find himself in clover with the stock guide he can open to any
page and see before his eyes a condensed panorama of the splen
dors and miseries of the stock market with alltime high and low
prices going as far back as 1936 when available he will find com
panies that have multiplied their price 2000 times from the minus
cule low to the majestic high for prestigious ibm the growth was
only 333 times in that period he will find not so exceptionally
a company whose shares advanced from 38 to 68 and then fell back
to 32 in the dividend record column he will find one that goes back
to 1791paid by industrial national bank of rhode island which
recently saw fit to change its ancient corporate name if he looks
at  the  guide for  the  yearend  1969  he  will  read  that  penn  central
co as successor to pennsylvania railroad has been paying divi
dends  steadily  since  1848  alas  it  was  doomed  to  bankruptcy  a
few months later he will find a company selling at only 2 times its
last  reported  earnings  and  another  selling  at  99  times  such  earn
ings3 in most cases he will find it difficult to tell the line of business
from  the  corporate  name  for  one  us  steel  there  will  be  three

a winnowing of the stock guide

suppose we look for a simple prima facie indication that a stock
is  cheap  the  first  such  clue  that  comes  to  mind  is  a  low  price  in
relation to recent earnings let us make a preliminary list of stocks
that sold at a multiple of nine or less at the end of 1970 that datum
is conveniently provided in the last column of the evennumbered
pages for an illustrative sample we shall take the first 20 such low
multiplier stocks they begin with the sixth issue listed aberdeen
mfg co which closed the year at 1014 or 9 times its reported earn
ings  of  125  per  share  for  the  12  months  ended  september  1970
the  twentieth  such  issue  is  american  maize  products  which
closed at 912 also with a multiplier of 9

the  group  may  have  seemed  mediocre  with  10  issues  selling
below  10  per  share  this  fact  is  not  truly  important  it  would
probablynot necessarilywarn defensive investors against such
a  list  but  the  inference  for  enterprising  investors  might  be  favor
able on balance before making a further scrutiny let us calculate
some numbers our list represents about one in ten of the first 200
issues  looked  at  on  that  basis  the  guide should  yield  say  450
issues  selling  at  multipliers  under  10  this  would  make  a  goodly
number of candidates for further selectivity

so let us apply to our list some additional criteria rather similar
to those we suggested for the defensive investor but not so severe
we suggest the following

1 financial condition a current assets at least 112 times current
liabilities and b debt not more than 110 of net current assets
for industrial companies

 for todays investor the cutoff is more likely to be around 1 per sharethe
level below which many stocks are delisted or declared ineligible for trad
ing on major exchanges just monitoring the stock prices of these companies
can take a considerable amount of effort making them impractical for defen
sive  investors  the  costs  of  trading  lowpriced  stocks  can  be  very  high
finally companies with very low stock prices have a distressing tendency to
go out of business however a diversified portfolio of dozens of these dis
tressed companies may still appeal to some enterprising investors today

386

the intelligent investor

2 earnings  stability  no  deficit  in  the  last  five  years  covered  in

the stock guide

3 dividend record some current dividend
4 earnings growth last years earnings more than those of 1966
5 price less than 120 net tangible assets

the earnings figures in the guide were generally for those end
ing september 30 1970 and thus do not include what may be a bad
quarter at the end of that year but an intelligent investor cannot ask
for  the  moonat  least  not  to  start  with  note  also  that  we  set  no
lower  limit  on  the  size  of  the  enterprise  small  companies  may
afford enough safety if bought carefully and on a group basis

when we have applied the five additional criteria our list of 20
candidates is reduced to only five let us continue our search until
the first 450 issues in the guide have yielded us a little portfolio
of  15  stocks  meeting  our  six  requirements  they  are  set  forth  in
table  151  together  with  some  relevant  data  the  group  of
course is presented for illustration only and would not necessarily
have been chosen by our inquiring investor

the fact is that the user of our method would have had a much
wider choice if our winnowing approach had been applied to all
4500  companies  in  the  stock  guide and  if  the  ratio  for  the  first
tenth had held good throughout we would end up with about 150
companies meeting all six of our criteria of selection the enterpris
ing  investor  would  then  be  able  to  follow  his  judgmentor  his
partialities and prejudicesin making a third selection of say one
out of five in this ample list

the stock  guide material  includes  earnings  and  dividend
rankings  which  are  based  on  stability  and  growth  of  these  fac
tors  for  the  past  eight  years  thus  price attractiveness  does  not
enter here we include the s  p rankings in our table 151 ten of
the 15 issues are ranked b  average and one american maize
is given the high rating of a if our enterprising investor wanted
to add a seventh mechanical criterion to his choice by considering
only  issues  ranked  by  standard    poors  as  average  or  better  in
quality he might still have about 100 such issues to choose from
one  might  say  that  a  group  of  issues  of  at  least  average  quality
meeting criteria of financial condition as well purchasable at a low
multiplier of current earnings and below asset value should offer
good promise of satisfactory investment results

single criteria for choosing common stocks

an inquiring reader might well ask whether the choice of a bet
ter than average portfolio could be made a simpler affair than we
have  just  outlined  could  a  single  plausible  criterion  be  used  to
good advantagesuch as a low priceearnings ratio or a high div
idend return or a large asset value the two methods of this sort
that  we  have  found  to  give  quite  consistently  good  results  in  the
longer past have been a the purchase of lowmultiplier stocks of
important companies such as the djia list and b the choice of a
diversified  group  of  stocks  selling  under  their  netcurrentasset

388

the intelligent investor

value or workingcapital value we have already pointed out that
the lowmultiplier criterion applied to the djia at the end of 1968
worked out badly when the results are measured to mid1971 the
record  of  commonstock  purchases  made  at  a  price  below  their
workingcapital value has no such bad mark against it the draw
back  here  has  been  the  drying  up  of  such  opportunities  during
most of the past decade

what about other bases of choice in writing this book we have
made a series of experiments each based on a single fairly obvi
ous  criterion  the  data  used  would  be  readily  found  in  the  stan
dard    poors  stock  guide in  all  cases  a  30stock  portfolio  was
assumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then
revalued  at  june  30  1971  the  separate  criteria  applied  were  the
following as applied to otherwise random choices 1 a low multi
plier  of  recent  earnings  not  confined  to  djia issues  2  a high
dividend return 3 a very long dividend record 4 a very large
enterprise  as  measured  by  number  of  outstanding  shares  5  a
strong financial position 6 a low price in dollars per share 7 a
low price in relation to the previous high price 8 a high quality
ranking by standard  poors

it will be noted that the stock guide has at least one column relat
ing  to  each  of  the  above  criteria  this  indicates  the  publishers
belief  that  each  is  of  importance  in  analyzing  and  choosing  com
mon  stocks  as  we  pointed  out  above  we  should  like  to  see
another figure added the netassetvalue per share

the  most  important  fact  that  emerges  from  our  various  tests
relates  to  the  performance  of  stocks  bought  at  random  we  have
tested this performance for three 30stock portfolios each made up
of  issues  found  on  the  first  line  of  the  december  31  1968  stock
guide and  also  found  in  the  issue  for  august  31  1971  between
these  two  dates  the  s    p composite  was  practically  unchanged
and  the  djia lost  about  5  but  our  90  randomly  chosen  issues
declined  an  average  of  22  not  counting  19  issues  that  were
dropped from the guide and probably showed larger losses these
comparative  results  undoubtedly  reflect  the  tendency  of  smaller
issues  of  inferior  quality  to  be  relatively  overvalued  in  bull  mar
kets and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger
issues  in  the  ensuing  price  collapse  but  also  to  delay  their  full
recoveryin many cases indefinitely the moral for the intelligent

stock selection for the enterprising investor

389

investor is of course to avoid secondquality issues in making up
a portfolio unlessfor the enterprising investorthey are demon
strable bargains

other  results  gleaned  from  our  portfolio  studies  may  be  sum

marized as follows

only  three  of  the  groups  studied  showed  up  better  than  the 
s  p composite and hence better than the djia viz 1 industri
als with the highest quality ranking a these advanced 912 in
the period against a decline of 24 for the s  p industrials and
56 for the djia however the ten publicutility issues rated a
declined 18 against a decline of 14 for the 55stock s  p public
utility index it is worth remarking that the s  p rankings showed
up very well in this single test in every case a portfolio based on a
higher ranking did better than a lowerranking portfolio 2 com
panies  with  more  than  50  million  shares  outstanding  showed  no
change on the whole as against a small decline for the indexes 3
strangely enough stocks selling at a high price per share over 100
showed a slight 1 composite advance

among our various tests we made one based on book value a
figure not given in the stock guide here we foundcontrary to our
investment philosophythat companies that combined major size
with  a  large  goodwill  component  in  their  market  price  did  very
well as a whole in the 212year holding period by goodwill com
ponent  we  mean  the  part  of  the  price  that  exceeds  the  book
value  our  list  of  goodwill  giants  was  made  up  of  30  issues
each of which had a goodwill component of over a billion dollars
representing  more  than  half  of  its  market  price  the  total  market
value  of  these  goodwill  items  at  the  end  of  1968  was  more  than
120 billions despite these optimistic market valuations the group
as  a  whole  showed  a  price  advance  per  share  of  15  between
december 1968 and august 1971 and acquitted itself best among
the 20odd lists studied

a fact  like  this  must  not  be  ignored  in  a  work  on  investment

 in grahams terms a large amount of goodwill can result from two causes
a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more than the
value of their assets or its own stock can trade for substantially more than
its book value

policies  it  is  clear  that  at  the  least  a  considerable  momentum is
attached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size
an  excellent  past  record  of  earnings  the  publics  expectation  of
continued earnings growth in the future and strong market action
over  many  past  years  even  if  the  price  may  appear  excessive  by
our quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may
well  carry  such  issues  along  more  or  less  indefinitely  naturally
this assumption does not apply to every individual issue in the cat
egory for example the indisputable goodwill leader ibm moved
down  from  315  to  304  in  the  30month  period  it  is  difficult  to
judge  to  what  extent  the  superior  market  action  shown  is  due  to
true or objective investment merits and to what extent to long
established popularity no doubt both factors are important here
clearly  both  the  longterm  and  the  recent  market  action  of  the
goodwill giants would recommend them for a diversified portfo
lio  of  common  stocks  our  own  preference  however  remains  for
other types that show a combination of favorable investment fac
tors including asset values of at least twothirds the market price
the  tests  using  other  criteria  indicate  in  general  that  random
lists based on a single favorable factor did better than random lists
chosen  for  the  opposite  factoreg  lowmultiplier  issues  had  a
smaller  decline  in  this  period  than  highmultiplier  issues  and
longterm dividend payers lost less than those that were not pay
ing dividends at the end of 1968 to that extent the results support
our recommendation that the issues selected meet a combination of
quantitative or tangible criteria

finally we should comment on the much poorer showing made
by  our  lists  as  a  whole  as  compared  with  the  price  record  of  the 
s  p composite the latter is weighted by the size of each enter
prise whereas our tests are based on taking one share of each com
pany evidently the larger emphasis given to giant enterprises by
the s  p method made a significant difference in the results and
points up once again their greater price stability as compared with

bargain issues or netcurrentasset stocks

ing 30 issues at a price less than their netcurrentasset value the rea

found in the stock guide at the end of 1968 but the picture changed in
the 1970 decline and at the low prices of that year a goodly number
of common stocks could have been bought at below their working
capital value it always seemed and still seems ridiculously simple
to say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at
a price less than the applicable net current assets aloneafter deduct
ing all prior claims and counting as zero the fixed and other assets
the  results  should  be  quite  satisfactory  they  were  so  in  our
experience for more than 30 yearssay between 1923 and 1957
excluding a time of real trial in 19301932

has this approach any relevance at the beginning of 1971 our
answer  would  be  a  qualified  yes a quick  runover  of  the  stock
guide would have uncovered some 50 or more issues that appeared
to  be  obtainable  at  or  below  netcurrentasset  value as  might  be
expected a good many of these had been doing badly in the diffi
cult  year  1970  if  we  eliminated  those  which  had  reported  net
losses  in  the  last  12month  period  we  would  be  still  left  with
enough issues to make up a diversified list

we have  included  in  table  152  some  data  on  five  issues  that
sold at less than their workingcapital value at their low prices of

 technically the workingcapital value of a stock is the current assets per

the intelligent investor

1970  these  give  some  food  for  reflection  on  the  nature  of  stock
price  fluctuations  how  does  it  come  about  that  wellestablished
companies whose brands are household names all over the coun
try  could  be  valued  at  such  low  figuresat  the  same  time  when
other concerns with better earnings growth of course were selling
for  billions  of  dollars  in  excess  of  what  their  balance  sheets
showed to quote the old days once more the idea of good will
as  an  element  of  intangible  value  was  usually  associated  with  a
trade name names such as lady pepperell in sheets jantzen in
swim suits and parker in pens would be considered assets of great
value indeed but now if the market does not like a company not
only  renowned  trade  names  but  land  buildings  machinery  and
what  you  will  can  all  count  for  nothing  in  its  scales  pascal  said
that  the  heart  has  its  reasons  that  the  reason  does not  under
stand for heart read wall street

there is another contrast that comes to mind when the going is
good and new issues are readily salable stock offerings of no qual
ity  at  all  make  their  appearance  they  quickly  find  buyers  their
prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels
in relation to assets and earnings that would put ibm xerox and
polaroid to shame wall street takes this madness in its stride with
no  overt  efforts  by  anyone  to  call  a  halt  before  the  inevitable  col
lapse in prices the sec cannot do much more than insist on disclo
sure  of  information  about  which  the  speculative  public  could not
care  less  or  announce  investigations  and  usually  mild  punitive
actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly
broken when many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enter
prises disappear from view or nearly so it is all taken philosophi
cally  enough  as  part  of  the  game  everybody  swears  off  such
inexcusable extravagancesuntil next time

thanks  for  the  lecture  says  the  gentle  reader  but  what  about
your bargain issues can one really make money in them with
out  taking  a  serious  risk  yes  indeed  if you  can  find  enough  of
them to make a diversified group and if you do not lose patience if

they  fail  to  advance  soon  after  you  buy  them  sometimes  the
patience  needed  may  appear  quite  considerable  in  our  previous
edition we hazarded a single example p 188 which was current
as  we  wrote  it  was  burtondixie  corp  with  stock  selling  at  20
against netcurrentasset value of 30 and book value of about 50 a
profit  on  that  purchase  would  not  have  been  immediate  but  in
august 1967 all the shareholders were offered 5334 for their shares
probably  at  just  about  book  value  a patient  holder  who  had
bought the shares in march 1964 at 20 would have had a profit of
165 in 312 yearsa noncompounded annual return of 47 most
of the bargain issues in our experience have not taken that long to
show good profitsnor have they shown so high a rate for a some
what  similar  situation  current  as  we  write  see  our  discussion  of
national presto industries above p 168

special situations or workouts

let us touch briefly on this area since it is theoretically includ
able  in  the  program  of  operations  of  an  enterprising  investor  it
was commented upon above here we shall supply some examples
of the genre and some further remarks on what it appears to offer
an openminded and alert investor

three such situations among others were current early in 1971

and they may be summarized as follows

situation 1 acquisition of kayserroth by bordens in january
1971  borden  inc  announced  a  plan  to  acquire  control  of  kayser
roth diversified apparel by giving 113 shares of its own stock in
exchange  for  one  share  of  kayserroth  on  the  following  day  in
active  trading  borden  closed  at  26  and  kayserroth  at  28  if  an
operator had bought 300 shares of kayserroth and sold 400 bor
den at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the
announced terms he would have had a profit of some 24 on the
cost of his shares less commissions and some other items assum
ing the deal had gone through in six months his final profit might
have been at about a 40 per annum rate

situation 2  in  november  1970  national  biscuit  co  offered  to
buy control of aurora plastics co at 11 in cash the stock was sell
ing at about 812 it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at
yearend here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25
subject to the risks of nonconsummation and to the time element

394

the intelligent investor

situation 3 universalmarion co which had ceased its business
operations asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern
the treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of
about 2812 per share a substantial part of which was in liquid form
the stock closed 1970 at 2112 indicating a possible gross profit here if
book value was realized in liquidation of more than 30

if  operations  of  this  kind  conducted  on  a  diversified  basis  for
spreading the risk could be counted to yield annual profits of say
20  or  better  they  would  undoubtedly  be  more  than  merely
worthwhile since this is not a book on special situations we are
not going into the details of the businessfor it really is a business
let  us  point  out  two  contradictory  developments  there  in  recent
years  on  the  one  hand  the  number  of  deals  to  choose  from  has
increased enormously as compared with say ten years ago this is
a consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to
diversify their activities through various types of acquisitions etc
in 1970 the number of merger announcements aggregated some
5000  down  from  over  6000  in  1969  the  total  money  values
involved in these deals amounted to many many billions perhaps
only a small fraction of the 5000 announcements could have pre
sented a clearcut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special
situations man but this fraction was still large enough to keep him
busy studying picking and choosing

the other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of
the mergers announced failed to be consummated in such cases of
course  the  aimedfor  profit  is  not  realized  and  is  likely  to  be
replaced by a more or less serious loss reasons for nonsuccess are
numerous  including  antitrust  intervention  shareholder  opposi
tion change in market conditions unfavorable indications from
further  study  inability  to  agree  on  details  and  others  the  trick
here of course is to have the judgment buttressed by experience
to pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are
likely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail

 as discussed in the commentary on chapter 7 merger arbitrage is wholly
inappropriate for most individual investors

further comment on the examples above

kayserroth the  directors  of  this  company  had  already
rejected  in  january  1971  the  borden  proposal  when  this  chapter
was written if the operation had been undone immediately the
overall  loss  including  commissions  would  have  been  about  12
of the cost of the kayserroth shares

aurora plastics because of the bad showing of this company
in 1970 the takeover terms were renegotiated and the price reduced
to 1012 the shares were paid for at the end of may the annual rate
of return realized here was about 25

universalmarion this  company  promptly  made  an  initial
distribution in cash and stock worth about 7 per share reducing
the investment to say 1412 however the market price fell as low as
13 subsequently casting doubt on the ultimate outcome of the liq
uidation

assuming  that  the  three  examples  given  are  fairly  representa
tive of workout or arbitrage opportunities as a whole in 1971 it
is clear that they are not attractive if entered into upon a random
basis  this  has  become  more  than  ever  a  field  for  professionals
with the requisite experience and judgment

there  is  an  interesting  sidelight  on  our  kayserroth  example
late in 1971 the price fell below 20 while borden was selling at 25
equivalent to 33 for kayserroth under the terms of the exchange
offer  it  would  appear  that  either  the  directors  had  made  a  great
mistake in turning down that opportunity or the shares of kayser
roth were now badly undervalued in the market something for a
security analyst to look into

max  heine  founder  of  the  mutual  series  funds  liked  to  say  that
there are many roads to jerusalem what this masterly stock picker
meant  was  that  his  own  valuecentered  method  of  selecting  stocks
was not the only way to be a successful investor in this chapter well
look at several techniques that some of todays leading money man
agers use for picking stocks

first though its worth repeating that for most investors selecting
individual stocks is unnecessaryif not inadvisable the fact that most
professionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most
amateurs  can  do  better  the  vast  majority  of  people  who  try  to  pick
stocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought the lucki
est ones discover this early on while the less fortunate take years to
learn it a small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own
stocks everyone else would be better off getting help ideally through
an index fund

graham advised investors to practice first just as even the greatest
athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per
formance he suggested starting off by spending a year tracking and
picking stocks but not with real money1 in grahams day you would

have  practiced  using  a  ledger  of  hypothetical  buys  and  sells  on  a 
legal pad nowadays you can use portfolio trackers at websites like
wwwmorningstarcom  httpfinanceyahoocom  httpmoneycnn
comservicesportfolio  or  wwwmarketocracycom  at  the  last  site
ignore the marketbeating hype on its funds and other services

by testdriving your techniques before trying them with real money
you  can  make  mistakes  without  incurring  any  actual  losses  develop
the  discipline  to  avoid  frequent  trading  compare  your  approach
against those of leading money managers and learn what works for
you best of all tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre
vent  you  from  forgetting  that  some  of  your  hunches  turn  out  to  be
stinkers that will force you to learn from your winners and your losers
after a year measure your results against how you would have done if
you had put all your money in an s  p 500 index fund if you did not
enjoy the experiment or your picks were poor no harm doneselecting
individual  stocks  is  not  for  you  get  yourself  an  index  fund  and  stop
wasting your time on stock picking

if you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns
gradually  assemble  a  basket  of  stocksbut  limit  it  to  a  maximum  of
10  of  your  overall  portfolio  keep  the  rest  in  an  index  fund  and
remember  you  can  always  stop  if  it  no  longer  interests  you  or  your
returns turn bad

so  how  should  you  go  about  looking  for  a  potentially  rewarding
stock  you  can  use  websites  like  httpfinanceyahoocom  and
wwwmorningstarcom to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug
gested in chapter 14 or you can take a more patient craftsmanlike
approach unlike most people many of the best professional investors

william nygren of the oakmark fund robert rodriguez of fpa capi

the  daily  list  of  new  52week  lows  in  the  wall  street  journal or  the
similar table in the market week section of barrons that will point
you  toward  stocks  and  industries  that  are  unfashionable  or  unloved
and  that  thus  offer  the  potential  for  high  returns  once  perceptions

net income or earnings per share eps has been distorted in
recent years by factors like stockoption grants and accounting
gains and charges to see how much a company is truly earning
on the capital it deploys in its businesses look beyond eps to
roic  or  return  on  invested  capital  christopher  davis  of  the
davis funds defines it with this formula

roic  owner earnings cid3 invested capital

where owner earnings is equal to

operating profit

plus depreciation

plus amortization of goodwill

minus federal income tax paid at the companys average rate

minus cost of stock options

minus maintenance or essential capital expenditures

minus any income generated by unsustainable rates of return on
pension funds as of 2003 anything greater than 65

and where invested capital is equal to

total assets

minus cash as well as shortterm investments and noninterest
bearing current liabilities

plus past accounting charges that reduced invested capital

roic has the virtue of showing after all legitimate expenses
what  the  company  earns  from  its  operating  businessesand
how efficiently it has used the shareholders money to generate
that return an roic of at least 10 is attractive even 6 or
7  can  be  tempting  if  the  company  has  good  brand  names

lexisnexis for examples of other firms in the same industries that have

to locate their past annual reports you may be able to determine the
ratio of purchase price to the earnings of those acquired companies
you  can  then  apply  that  ratio  to  estimate  how  much  a  corporate
acquirer might pay for a similar division of the company you are inves
tigating

by separately analyzing each of the companys divisions this way
you may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current
stock  price  longleafs  hawkins  likes  to  find  what  he  calls  60cent

grahams ideas buffett and his partner charles munger have
combined  grahams  margin  of  safety  and  detachment  from
the market with their own innovative emphasis on future growth
here is an alltoobrief summary of buffetts approach

he looks for what he calls franchise companies with strong
consumer  brands  easily  understandable  businesses  robust
financial health and nearmonopolies in their markets like h  r
block  gillette  and  the  washington  post  co  buffett  likes  to
snap  up  a  stock  when  a  scandal  big  loss  or  other  bad  news
passes over it like a storm cloudas when he bought cocacola
soon after its disastrous rollout of new coke and the market
crash  of  1987  he  also  wants  to  see  managers  who  set  and
meet  realistic  goals  build  their  businesses  from  within  rather
than through acquisition allocate capital wisely and do not pay
themselves  hundredmilliondollar  jackpots  of  stock  options
buffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings so
the company will be worth more in the future than it is today

in  his  annual  reports  archived  at  wwwberkshirehathaway
com buffett has set out his thinking like an open book probably
no other investor graham included has publicly revealed more
about  his  approach  or  written  such  compellingly  readable

convertible issues and warrants

convertible  bonds  and  preferred  stocks  have  been  taking  on  a
predominant  importance  in  recent  years  in  the  field  of  senior
financing  as  a  parallel  development  stockoption  warrants
which  are  longterm  rights  to  buy  common  shares  at  stipulated
priceshave  become  more  and  more  numerous  more  than  half
the  preferred  issues  now  quoted  in  the  standard    poors  stock
guide have conversion privileges and this has been true also of a
major part of the corporate bond financing in 19681970 there are
at least 60 different series of stockoption warrants dealt in on the
american stock exchange in 1970 for the first time in its history
the  new  york  stock  exchange  listed  an  issue  of  longterm  war
rants giving rights to buy 31400000 american tel  tel shares at
52  each  with  mother  bell  now  leading  that  procession  it  is
bound to be augmented by many new fabricators of warrants as
we  shall  point  out  later  they  are  a  fabrication  in  more  than  one
sense

in the overall picture the convertible issues rank as much more
important than the warrants and we shall discuss them first there
are two main aspects to be considered from the standpoint of the
investor first how do they rank as investment opportunities and
risks  second  how  does  their  existence  affect  the  value  of  the
related commonstock issues

convertible issues are claimed to be especially advantageous to
both the investor and the issuing corporation the investor receives
the  superior  protection  of  a  bond  or  preferred  stock  plus  the
opportunity to participate in any substantial rise in the value of the

 graham detested warrants as he makes clear on pp 413416

the intelligent investor

common  stock  the  issuer  is  able  to  raise  capital  at  a  moderate
interest or preferred dividend cost and if the expected prosperity
materializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav
ing it exchanged into common stock thus both sides to the bargain
will fare unusually well

obviously  the  foregoing  paragraph  must  overstate  the  case
somewhere for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar
gain  much  better  for  both  sides  in  exchange  for  the  conversion
privilege  the  investor  usually  gives  up  something  important  in
quality  or  yield  or  both1 conversely  if  the  company  gets  its
money at lower cost because of the conversion feature it is surren
dering in return part of the common shareholders claim to future
enhancement  on  this  subject  there  are  a  number  of  tricky  argu
ments to be advanced both pro and con the safest conclusion that
can be reached is that convertible issues are like any other form of
security  in  that  their  form  itself  guarantees  neither  attractiveness
nor  unattractiveness  that  question  will  depend  on  all  the  facts
surrounding the individual issue

we do  know  however  that  the  group  of  convertible  issues
floated  during  the  latter  part  of  a  bull  market  are  bound  to  yield
unsatisfactory results as a whole it is at such optimistic periods
unfortunately that most of the convertible financing has been done
in  the  past  the  poor  consequences  must  be  inevitable  from  the

ably  make  the  conversion  privilege  much  less  attractiveand
often  also  call  into  question  the  underlying  safety  of  the  issue

 graham is pointing out that despite the promotional rhetoric that investors
usually hear convertible bonds do not automatically offer the best of both
worlds higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand what
wall  street  gives  with  one  hand  it  usually  takes  away  with  the  other  an
investment may offer the best of one world or the worst of another but the
best of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package
 according  to  goldman  sachs  and  ibbotson  associates  from  1998
through  2002  convertibles  generated  an  average  annual  return  of  48
that was considerably better than the 06 annual loss on us stocks but
substantially  worse  than  the  returns  of  mediumterm  corporate  bonds  a

our  first  edition  of  the  relative  price  behavior  of  convertible  and
straight  nonconvertible  preferreds  offered  in  1946  the  closing
year of the bull market preceding the extraordinary one that began
in 1949

a comparable  presentation  is  difficult  to  make  for  the  years
19671970  because  there  were  virtually  no  new  offerings  of  non
convertibles  in  those  years  but  it  is  easy  to  demonstrate  that  the
average price decline of convertible preferred stocks from decem
ber  1967  to  december  1970  was  greater  than  that  for  common
stocks as a whole which lost only 5 also the convertibles seem
to  have  done  quite  a  bit  worse  than  the  older  straight  preferred
shares  during  the  period  december  1968  to  december  1970  as  is
shown by the sample of 20 issues of each kind in table 162 these

75 annual gain and longterm corporate bonds an 83 annual gain in
the  mid1990s  according  to  merrill  lynch  roughly  15  billion  in  convert
ibles  were  issued  annually  by  1999  issuance  had  more  than  doubled  to
39 billion in 2000 58 billion in convertibles were issued and in 2001
another  105  billion  emerged  as  graham  warns  convertible  securities
always  come  out  of  the  woodwork  near  the  end  of  a  bull  marketlargely
because even poorquality companies then have stock returns high enough
to make the conversion feature seem attractive

comparisons  would  demonstrate  that  convertible  securities  as  a
whole have relatively poor quality as senior issues and also are tied
to  common  stocks  that  do  worse  than  the  general  market  except
during a speculative upsurge these observations do not apply to
all convertible issues of course in the 1968 and 1969 particularly a
fair number of strong companies used convertible issues to combat
the inordinately high interest rates for even firstquality bonds but
it  is  noteworthy  that  in  our  20stock  sample  of  convertible  pre
ferreds only one showed an advance and 14 suffered bad declines

 recent structural changes in the convertible market have negated some of
these  criticisms  convertible  preferred  stock  which  made  up  roughly  half
the  total  convertible  market  in  grahams  day  now  accounts  for  only  an
eighth of the market maturities are shorter making convertible bonds less
volatile  and  many  now  carry  call  protection  or  assurances  against  early
redemption  and  more  than  half  of  all  convertibles  are  now  investment
grade a significant improvement in credit quality from grahams time thus
in 2002 the merrill lynch all us convertible index lost 86versus the
221  loss  of  the  s    p  500stock  index  and  the  313  decline  in  the
nasdaq composite stock index

the conclusion to be drawn from these figures is not that con
vertible issues are in themselves less desirable than nonconvertible
or  straight  securities  other  things  being  equal  the  opposite  is
true but we clearly see that other things are not equal in practice
and  that  the  addition  of  the  conversion  privilege  oftenperhaps
generallybetrays  an  absence  of  genuine  investment  quality  for
the issue

it is true of course that a convertible preferred is safer than the
common  stock  of  the  same  companythat  is  to  say  it  carries
smaller risk of eventual loss of principal consequently those who
buy new convertibles instead of the corresponding common stock
are logical to that extent but in most cases the common would not
have been an intelligent purchase to begin with at the ruling price
and the substitution of the convertible preferred did not improve
the picture sufficiently furthermore a good deal of the buying of
convertibles was done by investors who had no special interest or
confidence  in  the  common  stockthat  is  they  would  never  have
thought  of  buying  the  common  at  the  timebut  who  were
tempted  by  what  seemed  an  ideal  combination  of  a  prior  claim
plus a conversion privilege close to the current market in a num
ber of instances this combination has worked out well but the sta
tistics seem to show that it is more likely to prove a pitfall

in connection with the ownership of convertibles there is a spe
cial  problem  which  most  investors  fail  to  realize  even  when  a
profit appears it brings a dilemma with it should the holder sell on
a small rise should he hold for a much bigger advance if the issue
is calledas often happens when the common has gone up consid
erablyshould he sell out then or convert into and retain the com
mon stock

let us talk in concrete terms you buy a 6 bond at 100 convert
ible into stock at 25that is at the rate of 40 shares for each 1000
bond the stock goes to 30 which makes the bond worth at least
120 and so it sells at 125 you either sell or hold if you hold hop
ing for a higher price you are pretty much in the position of a com

 a bond is called when the issuing corporation forcibly pays it off ahead
of  the  stated  maturity  date  or  final  due  date  for  interest  payments  for  a
brief summary of how convertible bonds work see note 1 in the commen
tary on this chapter p 418

408

the intelligent investor

mon shareholder since if the stock goes down your bond will go
down  too a conservative  person  is  likely  to  say  that  beyond  125
his position has become too speculative and therefore he sells and
makes a gratifying 25 profit

so far so good but pursue the matter a bit in many cases where
the holder sells at 125 the common stock continues to advance car
rying  the  convertible  with  it  and  the  investor  experiences  that
peculiar  pain  that  comes  to  the  man  who  has  sold  out  much  too
soon  the  next  time  he  decides  to  hold  for  150  or  200  the  issue
goes up to 140 and he does not sell then the market breaks and his
bond slides down to 80 again he has done the wrong thing

aside  from  the  mental  anguish  involved  in  making  these  bad
guessesand  they  seem  to  be  almost  inevitablethere  is  a  real
arithmetical  drawback  to  operations  in  convertible  issues  it  may
be  assumed  that  a  stern  and  uniform  policy  of  selling  at  25  or
30  profit  will  work  out  best  as  applied  to  many  holdings  this
would then mark the upper limit of profit and would be realized
only on the issues that worked out well but ifas appears to be
truethese  issues  often  lack  adequate  underlying  security  and
tend to be floated and purchased in the latter stages of a bull mar
ket then a goodly proportion of them will fail to rise to 125 but will
not  fail  to  collapse  when  the  market  turns  downward  thus  the
spectacular  opportunities  in  convertibles  prove  to  be  illusory  in
practice  and  the  overall  experience  is  marked  by  fully  as  many
substantial lossesat least of a temporary kindas there are gains
of similar magnitude

because of the extraordinary length of the 19501968 bull market
convertible issues as a whole gave a good account of themselves for
some 18 years but this meant only that the great majority of common
stocks enjoyed large advances in which most convertible issues were
able to share the soundness of investment in convertible issues can
only be tested by their performance in a declining stock marketand
this has always proved disappointing as a whole

in our first edition 1949 we gave an illustration of this special

 in  recent  years  convertibles  have  tended  to  outperform  the  standard  
poors 500stock index during declining stock markets but they have typi
cally  underperformed  other  bondswhich  weakens  but  does  not  fully
negate the criticism graham makes here

convertible issues and warrants

409

problem  of  what  to  do  with  a  convertible  when  it  goes  up  we
believe it still merits inclusion here like several of our references it
is based on our own investment operations we were members of a
select group mainly of investment funds who participated in a
private offering of convertible 412 debentures of eversharp co at
par  convertible  into  common  stock  at  40  per  share  the  stock
advanced rapidly to 6512 and then after a threefortwo split to the
equivalent of 88 the latter price made the convertible debentures
worth  no  less  than  220  during  this  period  the  two  issues  were
called at a small premium hence they were practically all converted
into common stock which was retained by a number of the original
investmentfund  buyers  of  the  debentures  the  price  promptly
began a severe decline and in march 1948 the stock sold as low as
738 this represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues or a
loss of 75 of the original price instead of a profit of over 100

the real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers
converted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its
great decline in so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of wall
street which runs never convert a convertible bond why this
advice because once you convert you have lost your strategic com
bination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive
profit you have probably turned from investor into speculator and
quite often at an unpropitious time because the stock has already
had  a  large  advance  if  never  convert  a  convertible  is  a  good
rule how came it that these experienced fund managers exchanged
their eversharp bonds for stock to their subsequent embarrassing
loss the answer no doubt is that they let themselves be carried
away by enthusiasm for the companys prospects as well as by the
favorable market action of the shares wall street has a few pru
dent principles the trouble is that they are always forgotten when
they are most needed hence that other famous dictum of the old
timers do as i say not as i do

our  general  attitude  toward  new  convertible  issues  is  thus  a
mistrustful  one  we  mean  here  as  in  other  similar  observations

 this sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of the 1990s
among the few prudent principles that investors forgot were such market
cliches as trees do not grow to the sky and bulls make money bears make
money but pigs get slaughtered

410

the intelligent investor

that the investor should look more than twice before he buys them
after such hostile scrutiny he may find some exceptional offerings
that are too good to refuse the ideal combination of course is a
strongly  secured  convertible  exchangeable  for  a  common  stock
which itself is attractive and at a price only slightly higher than the
current  market  every  now  and  then  a  new  offering  appears  that
meets these requirements by the nature of the securities markets
however you are more likely to find such an opportunity in some
older  issue  which  has  developed  into  a  favorable  position  rather
than in a new flotation if a new issue is a really strong one it is
not likely to have a good conversion privilege

the fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in
a  standardtype  convertible  issue  is  well  illustrated  by  the  exten
sive use of this type of security in the financing of american tele
phone  telegraph company between 1913 and 1957 the company
sold  at  least  nine  separate  issues  of  convertible  bonds  most  of
them through subscription rights to shareholders the convertible
bonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in
a much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a
stock offering since the bonds were popular with many financial
institutions which possess huge resources but some of which were
not permitted to buy stocks the interest return on the bonds has
generally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on
the stocka factor that was calculated to offset the prior claim of
the  bondholders  since  the  company  maintained  its  9  dividend
rate for 40 years from 1919 to the stock split in 1959 the result was
the eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into
common  stock  thus  the  buyers  of  these  convertibles  have  fared
well through the yearsbut not quite so well as if they had bought
the  capital  stock  in  the  first  place  this  example  establishes  the
soundness of american telephone  telegraph but not the intrin
sic  attractiveness  of  convertible  bonds  to  prove  them  sound  in
practice  we  should  need  to  have  a  number  of  instances  in  which
the  convertible  worked  out  well  even  though  the  common  stock
proved disappointing such instances are not easy to find

effect of convertible issues on the status of 
the common stock

in a large number of cases convertibles have been issued in con
nection with mergers or new acquisitions perhaps the most strik
ing  example  of  this  financial  operation  was  the  issuance  by  the
nvf corp of nearly 100000000 of its 5 convertible bonds plus
warrants  in  exchange  for  most  of  the  common  stock  of  sharon
steel co this extraordinary deal is discussed below pp 429433
typically  the  transaction  results  in  a  pro  forma  increase  in  the
reported earnings per share of common stock the shares advance
in response to their larger earnings socalled but also because the
management has given evidence of its energy enterprise and abil
ity  to  make  more  money  for  the  shareholders  but  there  are  two
offsetting factors one of which is practically ignored and the other
entirely so in optimistic markets the first is the actual dilution of
the  current  and  future  earnings  on  the  common  stock  that  flows
arithmetically from the new conversion rights this dilution can be
quantified by taking the recent earnings or assuming some other
figures  and  calculating  the  adjusted  earnings  per  share  if  all  the
convertible shares or bonds were actually converted in the major
ity of companies the resulting reduction in pershare figures is not
significant  but  there  are  numerous  exceptions  to  this  statement
and there is danger that they will grow at an uncomfortable rate

tioners of convertible legerdemain in table 163 we list seven com

true  if  the  preferred  stock  had  a  conversion  privilege  close  to  the
market  the  reverse  is  generally  true  at  present as  a  result  there
are  a  considerable  number  of  convertible  preferred  stocks  which
are clearly more attractive than the related common shares own
ers of the common have nothing to lose and important advantages
to gain by switching from their junior shares into the senior issue

example  a typical  example  was  presented  by  studebaker
worthington  corp  at  the  close  of  1970  the  common  sold  at  57
while the 5 convertible preferred finished at 8712 each preferred
share  is  exchangeable  for  112 shares  of  common  then  worth  8512
this would indicate a small money difference against the buyer of
the preferred but dividends are being paid on the common at the
annual  rate  of  120  or  180  for  the  112 shares  against  the  5
obtainable on one share of preferred thus the original adverse dif
ference  in  price  would  probably  be  made  up  in  less  than  a  year
after  which  the  preferred  would  probably  return  an  appreciably
higher dividend yield than the common for some time to come but
most  important  of  course  would  be  the  senior  position  that  the
common shareholder would gain from the switch at the low prices

of 1968 and again in 1970 the preferred sold 15 points higher than
112 shares  of  common  its  conversion  privilege  guarantees  that  it
could never sell lower than the common package2

stockoption warrants

let  us  mince  no  words  at  the  outset  we  consider  the  recent
development of stockoption warrants as a near fraud an existing
menace and a potential disaster they have created huge aggregate
dollar values out of thin air they have no excuse for existence
except  to  the  extent  that  they  mislead  speculators  and  investors
they  should  be  prohibited  by  law  or  at  least  strictly  limited  to  a
minor part of the total capitalization of a company

for an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the
reader  to  the  section  of  faust part  2  in  which  goethe  describes
the  invention  of  paper  money as  an  ominous  precedent  on  wall
street  history  we  may  mention  the  warrants  of american    for
eign power co which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a
billion  dollars  although  they  appeared  only  in  a  footnote  to  the
companys balance sheet by 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to
8  million  and  in  1952  the  warrants  were  wiped  out  in  the
companys recapitalizationeven though it had remained solvent
originally  stockoption  warrants  were  attached  now  and  then
to bond issues and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion
privilege  they  were  unimportant  in  amount  and  hence  did  no
harm their use expanded in the late 1920s along with many other
financial abuses but they dropped from sight for long years there
after they were bound to turn up again like the bad pennies they
are  and  since  1967  they  have  become  familiar  instruments  of

 warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in
the nineteenth century and were fairly common even in grahams day they
have since diminished in importance and popularityone of the few recent
developments that would give graham unreserved pleasure as of yearend
2002  there  were  only  seven  remaining  warrant  issues  on  the  new  york
stock exchangeonly the ghostly vestige of a market because warrants are
no  longer  commonly  used  by  major  companies  todays  investors  should
read the rest of grahams chapter only to see how his logic works

414

the intelligent investor

finance  in  fact  a  standard  procedure  has  developed  for  raising
the capital for new realestate ventures affiliates of large banks by
selling units of an equal number of common shares and warrants
to  buy  additional  common  shares  at  the  same  price  example in
1971 clevetrust realty investors sold 2500000 of these combina
tions of common stock or shares of beneficial interest and war
rants for 20 per unit

let  us  consider  for  a  moment  what  is  really  involved  in  this
financial setup ordinarily a commonstock issue has the first right
to  buy  additional  common  shares  when  the  companys  directors
find it desirable to raise capital in this manner this socalled pre
emptive  right  is  one  of  the  elements  of  value  entering  into  the
ownership of common stockalong with the right to receive divi
dends  to  participate  in  the  companys  growth  and  to  vote  for
directors when separate warrants are issued for the right to sub
scribe  additional  capital  that  action  takes  away  part  of  the  value
inherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate
certificate an analogous thing could be done by issuing separate
certificates  for  the  right  to  receive  dividends  for  a  limited  or
unlimited  period  or  the  right  to  share  in  the  proceeds  of  sale  or
liquidation  of  the  enterprise  or  the  right  to  vote  the  shares  why
then are these subscription warrants created as part of the original
capital  structure  simply  because  people  are  inexpert  in  financial
matters  they  do not  realize  that  the  common  stock  is  worth  less
with  warrants  outstanding  than  otherwise  hence  the  package  of
stock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market
than would the stock alone note that in the usual company reports
the  pershare  earnings  are  or  have  been  computed  without
proper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants the result
is of course to overstate the true relationship between the earnings
and the market value of the companys capitalization

 today  the  last  remnant  of  activity  in  warrants  is  in  the  cesspool  of  the
nasdaq  bulletin  board  or  overthecounter  market  for  tiny  companies
where common stock is often bundled with warrants into a unit the con
temporary  equivalent  of  what  graham  calls  a  package  if  a  stockbroker
ever offers to sell you units in any company you can be 95 certain that
warrants are involved and at least 90 certain that the broker is either a
thief or an idiot legitimate brokers and firms have no business in this area

convertible issues and warrants

415

the simplest and probably the best method of allowing for the
existence of warrants is to add the equivalent of their market value
to  the  commonshare  capitalization  thus  increasing  the  true
market  price  per  share  where  large  amounts  of  warrants  have
been  issued  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  senior  securities  it  is
customary to make the adjustment by assuming that the proceeds
of  the  stock  payment  are  used  to  retire  the  related  bonds  or  pre
ferred shares this method does not allow adequately for the usual
premium  value  of  a  warrant  above  exercisable  value  in  table 
164 we compare the effect of the two methods of calculation in the
case of national general corp for the year 1970

does the company itself derive an advantage from the creation
of these warrants in the sense that they assure it in some way of
receiving additional capital when it needs some not at all ordi
narily there is no way in which the company can require the war
rantholders to exercise their rights and thus provide new capital
to the company prior to the expiration date of the warrants in the
meantime if the company wants to raise additional commonstock
funds it must offer the shares to its shareholders in the usual way
which  means  somewhat  under  the  ruling  market  price  the  war
rants are no help in such an operation they merely complicate the
situation  by  frequently  requiring  a  downward  revision  in  their
own  subscription  price  once  more  we  assert  that  large  issues  of
stockoption warrants serve no purpose except to fabricate imagi
nary market values

the paper money that goethe was familiar with when he wrote
his faust were  the  notorious  french  assignats  that  had  been
greeted as a marvelous invention and were destined ultimately to
lose all of their valueas did the billion dollars worth of american
  foreign  power  warrants  some  of  the  poets  remarks  apply

 the  notorious  french  assignats  were  issued  during  the  revolution  of
1789 they were originally debts of the revolutionary government purport
edly secured by the value of the real estate that the radicals had seized from
the catholic church and the nobility but the revolutionaries were bad finan
cial  managers  in  1790  the  interest  rate  on  assignats  was  cut  soon  they
stopped paying interest entirely and were reclassified as paper money but
the government refused to redeem them for gold or silver and issued massive
amounts of new assignats they were officially declared worthless in 1797

practical postscript

the crime of the warrants is in having been born once born
they function as other security forms and offer chances of profit as
well  as  of  loss  nearly  all  the  newer  warrants  run  for  a  limited
timegenerally  between  five  and  ten  years  the  older  warrants
were often perpetual and they were likely to have fascinating price
histories over the years

example the record books will show that tricontinental corp
warrants which date from 1929 sold at a negligible 132 of a dol
lar each in the depth of the depression from that lowly estate their
price rose to a magnificent 7534 in 1969 an astronomical advance of
some 242000 the warrants then sold considerably higher than
the shares themselves this is the kind of thing that occurs on wall
street  through  technical  developments  such  as  stock  splits  a
recent example is supplied by lingtemcovought warrants which
in  the  first  half  of  1971  advanced  from  212 to  1212and  then  fell
back to 4

no doubt shrewd operations can be carried on in warrants from
time to time but this is too technical a matter for discussion here
we might say that warrants tend to sell relatively higher than the
corresponding market components related to the conversion privi
lege  of  bonds  or  preferred  stocks  to  that  extent  there  is  a  valid
argument for selling bonds with warrants attached rather than cre
ating  an  equivalent  dilution  factor  by  a  convertible  issue  if  the
warrant total is relatively small there is no point in taking its theo
retical aspect too seriously if the warrant issue is large relative to
the outstanding stock that would probably indicate that the com
pany  has  a  topheavy  senior  capitalization  it  should  be  selling
additional common stock instead thus the main objective of our
attack  on  warrants  as  a  financial  mechanism  is  not  to  condemn
their  use  in  connection  with  moderatesize  bond  issues  but  to
argue  against  the  wanton  creation  of  huge  papermoney  mon
strosities of this genre

although  convertible  bonds  are  called  bonds  they  behave  like
stocks work like options and are cloaked in obscurity

if  you  own  a  convertible  you  also  hold  an  option  you  can  either
keep  the  bond  and  continue  to  earn  interest  on  it  or  you  can
exchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predeter
mined ratio an option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another
security at a given price within a specific period of time because they
are exchangeable into stock convertibles pay lower rates of interest
than most comparable bonds on the other hand if a companys stock
price soars a convertible bond exchangeable into that stock will per
form  much  better  than  a  conventional  bond  conversely  the  typical
convertiblewith  its  lower  interest  ratewill  fare  worse  in  a  falling
bond market1

1 as a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice consider the
475 convertible subordinated notes issued by doubleclick inc in 1999
they  pay  4750  in  interest  per  year  and  are  each  convertible  into  2424
shares of the companys common stock a conversion ratio of 2424 as of
yearend  2002  doubleclicks  stock  was  priced  at  566  a  share  giving
each bond a conversion value of 13720 566 cid1 2424 yet the bonds
traded  roughly  six  times  higher  at  88130creating  a  conversion  pre
mium or excess over their conversion value of 542 if you bought at that
price your breakeven time or payback period was very long you paid
roughly  750  more  than  the  conversion  value  of  the  bond  so  it  will  take
nearly 16 years of 4750 interest payments for you to earn back that con

from 1957 through 2002 according to ibbotson associates con
vertible bonds earned an annual average return of 83only two per
centage  points  below  the  total  return  on  stocks  but  with  steadier
prices and shallower losses2 more income less risk than stocks no
wonder  wall  streets  salespeople  often  describe  convertibles  as  a
best  of  both  worlds  investment  but  the  intelligent  investor  will
quickly realize that convertibles offer less income and more risk than
most  other  bonds so  they  could  by  the  same  logic  and  with  equal
justice be called a worst of both worlds investment which side you
come down on depends on how you use them

in truth convertibles act more like stocks than bonds the return on
convertibles is about 83 correlated to the standard  poors 500
stock  indexbut  only  about  30  correlated  to  the  performance  of
treasury bonds thus converts zig when most bonds zag for con
servative investors with most or all of their assets in bonds adding a
diversified  bundle  of  converts  is  a  sensible  way  to  seek  stocklike
returns  without  having  to  take  the  scary  step  of  investing  in  stocks
directly you could call convertible bonds stocks for chickens

as convertibles expert f barry nelson of advent capital manage
ment points out this roughly 200 billion market has blossomed since
grahams day most converts are now mediumterm in the sevento
10year  range  roughly  half  are  investmentgrade  and  many  issues
now carry some call protection an assurance against early redemp
tion all these factors make them less risky than they used to be3

version premium since each doubleclick bond is convertible to just over
24 common shares the stock will have to rise from 566 to more than 36
if  conversion  is  to  become  a  practical  option  before  the  bonds  mature  in
2006 such a stock return is not impossible but it borders on the miracu
lous the cash yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate given
the low probability of conversion
2 like many of the track records commonly cited on wall street this one is
hypothetical  it  indicates  the  return  you  would  have  earned  in  an  imagin
ary  index  fund  that  owned  all  major  convertibles  it  does  not  include  any
management  fees  or  trading  costs  which  are  substantial  for  convertible
securities in the real world your returns would have been roughly two per
centage points lower

and bank loansso in a bankruptcy convertible holders do not have prior

its expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds and diversifi
cation is impractical unless you have well over 100000 to invest in
this sector alone fortunately todays intelligent investor has the con
venient recourse of buying a lowcost convertible bond fund fidelity
and  vanguard  offer  mutual  funds  with  annual  expenses  comfortably
under 1 while several closedend funds are also available at a rea
sonable cost and occasionally at discounts to net asset value4

on  wall  street  cuteness  and  complexity  go  handinhandand
convertibles are no exception among the newer varieties are a jumble
of  securities  with  acronymic  nicknames  like  lyons  elks  eyes
percs mips chips and yeelds these intricate securities put a
floor under your potential losses but also cap your potential profits
and often compel you to convert into common stock on a fixed date
like most investments that purport to ensure against loss see sidebar
on  p  421  these  things  are  generally  more  trouble  than  they  are
worth you can best shield yourself against loss not by buying one of
these  quirky  contraptions  but  by  intelligently  diversifying  your  entire
portfolio across cash bonds and us and foreign stocks

claim to the companys assets and while they are not nearly as dicey as
highyield  junk  bonds  many  converts  are  still  issued  by  companies  with
less  than  sterling  credit  ratings  finally  a  large  portion  of  the  convertible
market  is  held  by  hedge  funds  whose  rapidfire  trading  can  increase  the
volatility of prices

as the bear market clawed its way through 2003 it dug up an
old fad writing covered call options a recent google search
on covered call writing turned up more than 2600 hits what
are covered calls and how do they work imagine that you buy
100  shares  of  ixnay  corp  at  95  apiece  you  then  sell  or
write  a  call  option  on  your  shares  in  exchange  you  get  a
cash payment known as a call premium let us say its 10 per
share the buyer of the option meanwhile has the contractual
right to buy your ixnay shares at a mutually agreedupon price
say 100 you get to keep the stock so long as it stays below
100 and you earn a fat 1000 in premium income which will
cushion the fall if ixnays stock crashes

less risk more income what is not to like
well now imagine that ixnays stock price jumps overnight to
110  then  your  option  buyer  will  exercise  his  rights  yanking
your shares away for 100 apiece you have still got your 1000
in income but hes got your ixnayand the more it goes up the
harder you will kick yourself1

since the potential gain on a stock is unlimited while no loss
can exceed 100 the only person you will enrich with this strat
egy  is  your  broker  you have  put  a  floor  under  your  losses  but
you have  also  slapped  a  ceiling  over  your  gains  for  individual
investors  covering  your  downside  is  never  worth  surrendering
most of your upside

1 alternatively you could buy back the call option but you would have to take

a loss on itand options can have even higher trading costs than stocks

four extremely instructive case histories

the word extremely in the title is a kind of pun because the his
tories  represent  extremes  of  various  sorts  that  were  manifest  on
wall street in recent years they hold instruction and grave warn
ings for everyone who has a serious connection with the world of
stocks and bondsnot only for ordinary investors and speculators
but  for  professionals  security  analysts  fund  managers  trust
account administrators and even for bankers who lend money to
corporations the four companies to be reviewed and the different
extremes that they illustrate are

penn central railroad co an extreme example of the neglect of
the most elementary warning signals of financial weakness by all
those who had bonds or shares of this system under their supervi
sion a crazily high market price for the stock of a tottering giant

lingtemcovought  inc an  extreme  example  of  quick  and
unsound  empire  building  with  ultimate  collapse  practically
guaranteed but helped by indiscriminate bank lending

nvf corp an extreme example of one corporate acquisition in
which  a  small  company  absorbed  another  seven  times  its  size
incurring  a  huge  debt  and  employing  some  startling  accounting
devices

aaa enterprises an extreme example of public stockfinancing
of a small company its value based on the magic word franchis
ing  and  little  else  sponsored  by  important  stockexchange
houses  bankruptcy  followed  within  two  years  of  the  stock  sale
and the doubling of the initial inflated price in the heedless stock
market

four extremely instructive case histories

423

the penn central case

this  is  the  countrys  largest  railroad  in  assets  and  gross  rev
enues  its  bankruptcy  in  1970  shocked  the  financial  world  it  has
defaulted  on  most  of  its  bond  issues  and  has  been  in  danger  of
abandoning  its  operations  entirely  its  security  issues  fell  drasti
cally in price the common stock collapsing from a high level of 8612
as recently as 1968 to a low of 512 in 1970 there seems little doubt
that these shares will be wiped out in reorganization

our  basic  point  is  that  the  application  of  the  simplest  rules  of
security analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment
would have revealed the fundamental weakness of the penn cen
tral system long before its bankruptcycertainly in 1968 when the
shares were selling at their post1929 record and when most of its
bond  issues  could  have  been  exchanged  at  even  prices  for  well
secured publicutility obligations with the same coupon rates the
following comments are in order

1 in the s  p bond guide the interest charges of the system are
shown  to  have  been  earned  191  times  in  1967  and  198  times  in
1968 the minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our
textbook security  analysis is  5  times  before  income  taxes  and  29
times  after  income  taxes  at  regular  rates  as  far  as  we  know  the
validity  of  these  standards  has  never  been  questioned  by  any
investment authority on the basis of our requirements for earnings
after taxes the penn central fell short of the requirements for safety
but our aftertax requirement is based on a beforetax ratio of five
times with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest in
the case of penn central it had been paying no income taxes to speak
of for the past 11 years hence the coverage of its interest charges
before  taxes  was  less  than  two  timesa  totally  inadequate  figure
against our conservative requirement of 5 times

 how shocked was the financial world by the penn centrals bankruptcy
which was filed over the weekend of june 2021 1970 the closing trade
in penn centrals stock on friday june 19 was 1125 per sharehardly a
goingoutofbusiness  price  in  more  recent  times  stocks  like  enron  and
worldcom  have  also  sold  at  relatively  high  prices  shortly  before  filing  for
bankruptcy protection

424

the intelligent investor

2 the fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a
period should have raised serious questions about the validity of its
reported earnings

3  the  bonds  of  the  penn  central  system  could  have  been
exchanged in 1968 and 1969 at no sacrifice of price or income for
far  better  secured  issues  for  example  in  1969  pennsylvania  rr
412s due 1994 part of penn central had a range of 61 to 7412 while
pennsylvania electric co 438s due 1994 had a range of 6414 to 7214
the public utility had earned its interest 420 times before taxes in
1968  against  only  198  times  for  the  penn  central  system  during
1969  the  latters  comparative  showing  grew  steadily  worse  an
exchange of this sort was clearly called for and it would have been
a lifesaver for a penn central bondholder at the end of 1970 the
railroad  414s  were  in  default  and  selling  at  only  1812  while  the
utilitys 438s closed at 6612

4 penn central reported earnings of 380 per share in 1968 its
high price of 8612 in that year was 24 times such earnings but any
analyst  worth  his  salt  would  have  wondered  how  real  were
earnings of this sort reported without the necessity of paying any
income taxes thereon

5  for  1966  the  newly  merged  company  had  reported  earn
ings  of  680  a  sharein  reflection  of  which  the  common  stock
later rose to its peak of 8612 this was a valuation of over 2 billion
for the equity how many of these buyers knew at the time that the
so  lovely  earnings  were  before a  special  charge  of  275  million  or
12 per share to be taken in 1971 for costs and losses incurred on
the merger o wondrous fairyland of wall street where a company
can announce profits of 680 per share in one place and special
costs and losses of 12 in another and shareholders and specula
tors rub their hands with glee

 penn central was the product of the merger announced in 1966 of the
pennsylvania railroad and the new york central railroad
 this  kind  of  accounting  legerdemain  in  which  profits  are  reported  as  if
unusual or extraordinary or nonrecurring charges do not matter antici
pates the reliance on pro forma financial statements that became popular
in the late 1990s see the commentary on chapter 12

four extremely instructive case histories

425

6  a railroad  analyst  would  have  long  since  known  that  the
operating picture of the penn central was very bad in comparison
with  the  more  profitable  roads  for  example  its  transportation
ratio was 475 in 1968 against 352 for its neighbor norfolk 
western

7  along  the  way  there  were  some  strange  transactions  with
peculiar accounting results1 details are too complicated to go into
here

conclusion whether better management could have saved the
penn  central  bankruptcy  may  be  arguable  but  there  is  no  doubt
whatever that no bonds and no shares of the penn central system
should  have  remained  after  1968  at  the  latest  in  any  securities
account watched over by competent security analysts fund man
agers trust officers or investment counsel moral security analysts
should  do  their  elementary  jobs  before  they  study  stockmarket
movements  gaze  into  crystal  balls  make  elaborate  mathematical
calculations or go on allexpensepaid field trips

lingtemcovought inc

this  is  a  story  of  headoverheels  expansion  and  headover
heels debt ending up in terrific losses and a host of financial prob
lems  as  usually  happens  in  such  cases  a  fairhaired  boy  or
young genius was chiefly responsible for both the creation of the
great empire and its ignominious downfall but there is plenty of
blame to be accorded others as well

 a railroads transportation ratio now more commonly called its operating
ratio measures the expenses of running its trains divided by the railroads
total  revenues  the  higher  the  ratio  the  less  efficient  the  railroad  today
even a ratio of 70 would be considered excellent
 today  penn  central  is  a  faded  memory  in  1976  it  was  absorbed  into
consolidated  rail  corp  conrail  a  federallyfunded  holding  company 
that bailed out several failed railroads conrail sold shares to the public in
1987 and in 1997 was taken over jointly by csx corp and norfolk south
ern corp
 lingtemcovought inc was founded in 1955 by james joseph ling an
electrical contractor who sold his first 1 million worth of shares to the pub

426

the intelligent investor

the rise and fall of lingtemcovought can be summarized by
setting  forth  condensed  income  accounts  and  balancesheet  items
for  five  years  between  1958  and  1970  this  is  done  in  table  171
the first column shows the companys modest beginnings in 1958
when its sales were only 7 million the next gives figures for 1960
the enterprise had grown twentyfold in only two years but it was
still comparatively small then came the heyday years to 1967 and
1968 in which sales again grew twentyfold to 28 billion with the
debt figure expanding from 44 million to an awesome 1653 mil
lion in 1969 came new acquisitions a further huge increase in debt
to a total of 1865 million and the beginning of serious trouble
a large  loss  after  extraordinary  items  was  reported  for  the  year
the stock price declined from its 1967 high of 16912 to a low of 24
the young genius was superseded as the head of the company the
1970  results  were  even  more  dreadful  the  enterprise  reported  a
final  net  loss  of  close  to  70  million  the  stock  fell  away  to  a  low
price of 718 and its largest bond issue was quoted at one time at a
pitiable  15  cents  on  the  dollar  the  companys  expansion  policy
was  sharply  reversed  various  of  its  important  interests  were
placed on the market and some headway was made in reducing its
mountainous obligations

the figures in our table speak so eloquently that few comments

are called for but here are some

lic by becoming his own investment banker hawking prospectuses from a
booth set up at the texas state fair his success at that led him to acquire
dozens of different companies almost always using ltvs stock to pay for
them  the  more  companies  ltv  acquired  the  higher  its  stock  went  the
higher  its  stock  went  the  more  companies  it  could  afford  to  acquire  by
1969 ltv was the 14th biggest firm on the fortune 500 list of major us
corporations and then as graham shows the whole house of cards came
crashing down ltv corp now exclusively a steelmaker ended up seeking
bankruptcy protection in late 2000 companies that grow primarily through
acquisitions  are  called  serial  acquirersand  the  similarity  to  the  term
serial killers is no accident as the case of ltv demonstrates serial acquir
ers  nearly  always  leave  financial  death  and  destruction  in  their  wake
investors who understood this lesson of grahams would have avoided such
darlings of the 1990s as conseco tyco and worldcom

the intelligent investor

1  the  companys  expansion  period  was  not  without  an  inter
ruption in 1961 it showed a small operating deficit butadopting
a practice that was to be seen later in so many reports for 1970
evidently  decided  to  throw  all  possible  charges  and  reserves  into
the one bad year these amounted to a round 13 million which
was  more  than  the  combined  net  profits  of  the  preceding  three
years it was now ready to show record earnings in 1962 etc

2 at the end of 1966 the net tangible assets are given as 766 per
share  of  common  adjusted  for  a  3for2  split  thus  the  market
price  in  1967  reached  22  times    its  reported  asset  value  at  the
time  at  the  end  of  1968  the  balance  sheet  showed  286  million
available  for  3800000  shares  of  common  and  class aa stock  or
about  77  per  share  but  if  we  deduct  the  preferred  stock  at  full
value and exclude the goodwill items and the huge bonddiscount
asset there would remain 13 million for the commona mere
3 per share this tangible equity was wiped out by the losses of
the following years

3  toward  the  end  of  1967  two  of  our  bestregarded  banking
firms  offered  600000  shares  of  lingtemcovought  stock  at  111
per share it had been as high as 16912 in less than three years the
price fell to 718

 the sordid tradition of hiding a companys true earnings picture under the
cloak of restructuring charges is still with us piling up every possible charge
in one year is sometimes called big bath or kitchen sink accounting this
bookkeeping gimmick enables companies to make an easy show of appar
ent  growth  in  the  following  yearbut  investors  should  not  mistake  that  for
real business health
 the  bonddiscount  asset  appears  to  mean  that  ltv  had  purchased
some  bonds  below  their  par  value  and  was  treating  that  discount  as  an
asset on the grounds that the bonds could eventually be sold at par gra
ham scoffs at this since there is rarely any way to know what a bonds mar
ket price will be on a given date in the future if the bonds could be sold only
at values below par this asset would in fact be a liability
 we can only imagine what graham would have thought of the investment
banking  firms  that  brought  infospace  inc  public  in  december  1998  the
stock  adjusted  for  later  splits  opened  for  trading  at  3125  peaked  at

4 at the end of 1967 the bank loans had reached 161 million
and  a  year  later  they  stood  at  414  millionwhich  should  have
been  a  frightening  figure  in  addition  the  longterm  debt
amounted to 1237 million by 1969 combined debt reached a total
of  1869  million  this  may  have  been  the  largest  combined  debt
figure of any industrial company anywhere and at any time with
the single exception of the impregnable standard oil of nj

5 the losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since

the formation of the company

moral the primary question raised in our mind by the ling
temcovought  story  is  how  the  commercial  bankers  could  have
been persuaded to lend the company such huge amounts of money
during  its  expansion  period  in  1966  and  earlier  the  companys
coverage of interest charges did not meet conservative standards
and the same was true of the ratio of current assets to current liabil
ities and of stock equity to total debt but in the next two years the
banks  advanced  the  enterprise  nearly  400  million  additional  for
further diversification this was not good business for them and
it was worse in its implications for the companys shareholders if
the lingtemcovought case will serve to keep commercial banks
from  aiding  and  abetting  unsound  expansions  of  this  type  in  the
future some good may come of it at last

the nvf takeover of sharon steel a collectors item

at the end of 1968 nvf company was a company with 46 mil
lion of longterm debt 174 million of stock capital 31 million of
sales  and  502000  of  net  income  before  a  special  credit  of
374000 its business was described as vulcanized fiber and plas
tics the management decided to take over the sharon steel corp

130532 per share in march 2000 and finished 2002 at a princely 845
per share
 graham  would  have  been  disappointed  though  surely  not  surprised  to
see  that  commercial  banks  have  chronically  kept  supporting  unsound
expansions enron and worldcom two of the biggest collapses in corpo
rate history were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank loans

430

the intelligent investor

which had 43 million of longterm debt 101 million of stock cap
ital 219 million of sales and 2929000 of net earnings the com
pany it wished to acquire was thus seven times the size of nvf in
early 1969 it made an offer for all the shares of sharon the terms
per share were 70 face amount of nvf junior 5 bonds due 1994
plus  warrants  to  buy  112 shares  of  nvf  stock  at  22  per  share  of
nvf  the  management  of  sharon  strenuously  resisted  this
takeover  attempt  but  in  vain  nvf  acquired  88  of  the  sharon
stock under the offer issuing therefore 102 million of its 5 bonds
and warrants for 2197000 of its shares had the offer been 100
operative  the  consolidated  enterprise  would  for  the  year  1968
have had 163 million in debt only 22 million in tangible stock
capital  250  million  of  sales  the  netearnings  question  would
have been a bit complicated but the company subsequently stated
them  as  a  net  loss  of  50  cents  per  share  of  nvf  stocks  before  an
extraordinary  credit  and  net  earnings  of  3  cents  per  share  after
such credit

first  comment among  all  the  takeovers  effected  in  the  year
1969 this was no doubt the most extreme in its financial dispropor
tions  the  acquiring  company  had  assumed  responsibility  for  a
new and topheavy debt obligation and it had changed its calcu
lated 1968 earnings from a profit to a loss into the bargain a mea
sure of the impairment of the companys financial position by this

 in  june  1972  just  after  graham  finished  this  chapter  a  federal  judge
found that nvfs chairman victor posner had improperly diverted the pen
sion assets of sharon steel to assist affiliated companies in their takeovers
of other corporations in 1977 the us securities and exchange commis
sion secured a permanent injunction against posner nvf and sharon steel
to  prevent  them  from  future  violations  of  federal  laws  against  securities
fraud  the  commission  alleged  that  posner  and  his  family  had  improperly
obtained  17  million  in  personal  perks  from  nvf  and  sharon  overstated
sharons  pretax  earnings  by  139  million  misrecorded  inventory  and
shifted  income  and  expenses  from  one  year  to  another  sharon  steel
which  graham  had  singled  out  with  his  cold  and  skeptical  eye  became
known  among wall  street  wags  as  share  and  steal  posner  was  later  a
central  force  in  the  wave  of  leveraged  buyouts  and  hostile  takeovers  that
swept the united states in the 1980s as he became a major customer for
the junk bonds underwritten by drexel burnham lambert

step is found in the fact that the new 5 bonds did not sell higher
than 42 cents on the dollar during the year of issuance this would
have  indicated  grave  doubt  of  the  safety  of  the  bonds  and  of  the
companys  future  however  the  management  actually  exploited
the bond price in a way to save the company annual income taxes
of about 1000000 as will be shown

the 1968 report published after the sharon takeover contained
a condensed picture of its results carried back to the yearend this
contained two most unusual items

1  there  is  listed  as  an  asset  58600000  of  deferred  debt
expense  this  sum  is  greater  than  the  entire  stockholders
equity placed at 40200000

2 however not included in the shareholders equity is an item
of 20700000 designated as excess of equity over cost of invest
ment in sharon

second comment if we eliminate the debt expense as an asset
which  it  hardly  seems  to  be  and  include  the  other  item  in  the
shareholders  equity  where  it  would  normally  belong  then  we
have  a  more  realistic  statement  of  tangible  equity  for  nvf  stock
viz  2200000  thus  the  first  effect  of  the  deal  was  to  reduce
nvfs real equity from 17400000 to 2200000 or from 2371
per share to about 3 per share on 731000 shares in addition the
nvf shareholders had given to others the right to buy 312 times as
many additional shares at six points below the market price at the
close  of  1968  the  initial  market  value  of  the  warrants  was  then
about 12 each or a total of some 30 million for those involved in
the purchase offer actually the market value of the warrants well
exceeded  the  total  market  value  of  the  outstanding  nvf  stock
another evidence of the tailwaggingdog nature of the transaction

the accounting gimmicks

when  we  pass  from  this  pro  forma  balance  sheet  to  the  next
years report we find several strangeappearing entries in addition
to the basic interest expense a hefty 7500000 there is deducted
1795000  for  amortization  of  deferred  debt  expense  but  this
last is nearly offset on the next line by a very unusual income item

432

the intelligent investor

indeed  amortization  of  equity  over  cost  of  investment  in  sub
sidiary  cr  1650000  in  one  of  the  footnotes  we  find  an  entry
not appearing in any other report that we know of part of the stock
capital is there designated as fair market value of warrants issued
in connection with acquisition etc 22129000

what on earth do all these entries mean none of them is even
referred  to  in  the  descriptive  text  of  the  1969  report  the  trained
security  analyst  has  to  figure  out  these  mysteries  by  himself
almost in detective fashion he finds that the underlying idea is to
derive a tax advantage from the low initial price of the 5 deben
tures for readers who may be interested in this ingenious arrange
ment we set forth our solution in appendix 6

other unusual items

1  right  after  the  close  of  1969  the  company  bought  in  no  less
than 650000 warrants at a price of 938 each this was extraordi
nary  when  we  consider  that  a  nvf  itself  had  only  700000  in
cash at the yearend and had 4400000 of debt due in 1970 evi
dently the 6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed b
it was buying in this warrant paper money at a time when its 5
bonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollarordinarily a
warning that financial difficulties lay ahead

2 as a partial offset to this the company had retired 5100000
of  its  bonds  along  with  253000  warrants  in  exchange  for  a  like
amount  of  common  stock  this  was  possible  because  by  the
vagaries  of  the  securities  markets  people  were  selling  the  5
bonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of
1312 paying no dividend

3 the company had plans in operation not only for selling stock
to its employees but also for selling them a larger number of war
rants to buy the stock like the stock purchases the warrants were
to be paid for 5 down and the rest over many years in the future
this is the only such employeepurchase plan for warrants that we
know of will someone soon invent and sell on installments a right
to buy a right to buy a share and so on

changed  its  method  of  arriving  at  its  pension  costs  and  also

adopted lower depreciation rates these accounting changes added
about 1 per share to the reported earnings of nvf before dilution

5 at the end of 1970 standard  poors stock guide reported that
nvf shares were selling at a priceearning ratio of only 2 the lowest
figure for all the 4500odd issues in the booklet as the old wall street
saying went this was important if true the ratio was based on the
years closing price of 834 and the computed earnings of 538 per
share for the 12 months ended september 1970 using these figures
the shares were selling at only 16 times earnings but this ratio did
not  allow  for  the  large  dilution  factor  nor  for  the  adverse  results
actually realized in the last quarter of 1970 when the full years fig
ures finally appeared they showed only 203 per share earned for
the  stock  before  allowing  for  dilution  and  180  per  share  on  a
diluted basis note also that the aggregate market price of the stock
and warrants on that date was about 14 million against a bonded
debt of 135 milliona skimpy equity position indeed

aaa enterprises

history

about  15  years  ago  a  college  student  named  williams  began
selling mobile homes then called trailers in 1965 he incorpo

 the large dilution factor would be triggered when nvf employees exer
cised their warrants to buy common stock the company would then have to
issue  more  shares  and  its  net  earnings  would  be  divided  across  a  much
greater number of shares outstanding
 jackie g williams founded aaa enterprises in 1958 on its first day of trad
ing the stock soared 56 to close at 2025 williams later announced that
aaa would come up with a new franchising concept every month if people
would step into a mobile home to get their income taxes done by mr tax of
america just imagine what else they might do inside a trailer but aaa ran
out of time and money before williams ran out of ideas the history of aaa
enterprises is reminiscent of the saga of a later company with charismatic man
agement  and  scanty  assets  zzzz  best  achieved  a  stockmarket  value  of
roughly 200 million in the late 1980s even though its purported industrial
vacuumcleaning business was little more than a telephone and a rented office
run by a teenager named barry minkow zzzz best went bust and minkow

the intelligent investor

rated his business in that year he sold 5800000 of mobile homes
and earned 61000 before corporate tax by 1968 he had joined the
franchising  movement  and  was  selling  others  the  right  to  sell
mobile  homes  under  his  business  name  he  also  conceived  the
bright  idea  of  going  into  the  business  of  preparing  incometax
returns using his mobile homes as offices he formed a subsidiary
company  called  mr  tax  of america  and  of  course  started  to  sell
franchises  to  others  to  use  the  idea  and  the  name  he  multiplied
the  number  of  corporate  shares  to  2710000  and  was  ready  for  a
stock  offering  he  found  that  one  of  our  largest  stockexchange
houses along with others was willing to handle the deal in march
1969 they offered the public 500000 shares of aaa enterprises at
13 per share of these 300000 were sold for mr williamss per
sonal  account  and  200000  were  sold  for  the  company  account
adding 2400000 to its resources the price of the stock promptly
doubled  to  28  or  a  value  of  84  million  for  the  equity  against  a
book value of say 4200000 and maximum reported earnings of
690000 the stock was thus selling at a tidy 115 times its current
and  largest  earnings  per  share  no  doubt  mr  williams  had
selected  the  name aaa enterprise  so  that  it  might  be  among  the
first  in  the  phone  books  and  the  yellow  pages a collateral  result
was that his company was destined to appear as the first name in
standard    poors  stock  guide like abubenadhems  it  led  all
the  rest  this  gives  a  special  reason  to  select  it  as  a  harrowing
example of 1969 new financing and hot issues

comment  this  was  not  a  bad  deal  for  mr  williams  the
300000  shares  he  sold  had  a  book  value  in  december  of  1968  of
180000  and  he  netted  therefor  20  times  as  much  or  a  cool
3600000  the  underwriters  and  distributors  split  500000
between them less expenses

went to jail even as you read this another similar company is being formed
and a new generation of investors will be taken for a ride no one who has
read graham however should climb on board

1 this did not seem so brilliant a deal for the clients of the sell
ing houses they were asked to pay about ten times the book value
of the stock after the bootstrap operation of increasing their equity
per share from 59 cents to 135 with their own money before the
best  year  1968  the  companys  maximum  earnings  had  been  a
ridiculous  7  cents  per  share  there  were  ambitious  plans  for  the
future of coursebut the public was being asked to pay heavily in
advance for the hopedfor realization of these plans

2 nonetheless the price of the stock doubled soon after original
issuance  and  any  one  of  the  brokeragehouse  clients  could  have
gotten out at a handsome profit did this fact alter the flotation or
did  the  advance  possibility  that  it  might  happen  exonerate  the
original distributors of the issue from responsibility for this public
offering and its later sequel not an easy question to answer but it
deserves careful consideration by wall street and the government
regulatory agencies

subsequent history

with  its  enlarged  capital  aaa enterprises  went  into  two  addi
tional businesses in 1969 it opened a chain of retail carpet stores and
it  acquired  a  plant  that  manufactured  mobile  homes  the  results
reported for the first nine months were not exactly brilliant but they
were a little better than the year before22 cents a share against 14

 by  purchasing  more  common  stock  at  a  premium  to  its  book  value  the
investing public increased the value of aaas equity per share but investors
were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps since most of the
rise in shareholders equity came from the publics own willingness to over
pay for the stock
 grahams point is that investment banks are not entitled to take credit for
the gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial public offering unless
they  are  also  willing  to  take  the  blame  for  the  stocks  performance  in  the
longer  term  many  internet  ipos  rose  1000  or  more  in  1999  and  early
2000  most  of  them  lost  more  than  95  in  the  subsequent  three  years
how could these early gains earned by a few investors justify the massive
destruction of wealth suffered by the millions who came later many ipos
were  in  fact  deliberately  underpriced  to  manufacture  immediate  gains
that would attract more attention for the next offering

436

the intelligent investor

cents  what  happened  in  the  next  months  was  literally  incredible
the company lost 4365000 or 149 per share this consumed all its
capital before the financing plus the entire 2400000 received on the
sale of stock plus twothirds of the amount reported as earned in the
first nine months of 1969 there was left a pathetic 242000 or 8 cents
per share of capital for the public shareholders who had paid 13 for
the new offering only seven months before nonetheless the shares
closed the year 1969 at 818 bid or a valuation of more than 25 mil
lion for the company

further comment 1 it is too much to believe that the company
had actually earned 686000 from january to september 1969 and
then lost 4365000 in the next three months there was something
sadly badly and accusingly wrong about the september 30 report

2 the years closing price of 818 bid was even more of a demon
stration  of  the  complete  heedlessness  of  stockmarket  prices  than
were the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent hotissue
advance  to  a  high  bid  of  28  these  latter  quotations  at  least  were
based on enthusiasm and hopeout of all proportion to reality and
common sense but at least comprehensible the yearend valuation
of 25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus
cule remnant of its capital for which a completely insolvent condi
tion was imminent and for which the words enthusiasm or hope
would be only bitter sarcasms it is true the yearend figures had not
been published by december 31 but it is the business of wall street
houses associated with a company to have monthly operating state
ments and a fairly exact idea of how things are going

final chapter

for the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of
1 million it now had a goodsized capital deficit it was kept out
of  bankruptcy  by  loans  made  by  mr  williams  up  to  a  total  of
2500000 no further statements seem to have been issued until
in  january  1971 aaa enterprises  finally  filed  a  petition  in  bank
ruptcy the quotation for the stock at monthend was still 50 cents
a share bid or 1500000 for the entire issue which evidently had
no more than wallpaper value end of our story

any company identified with franchising computers electronics

could and should the sec be given other powers to protect the pub
lic beyond the present ones which are limited to requiring the print
ing of all important relevant facts in the offering prospectus should
some kind of box score for public offerings of various types be com
piled and published in conspicuous fashion should every prospec
tus  and  perhaps  every  confirmation  of  sale  under  an  original
offering carry some kind of formal warranty that the offering price
for the issue is not substantially out of line with the ruling prices for
issues of the same general type already established in the market as
we  write  this  edition  a  movement  toward  reform  of  wall  street
abuses  is  under  way  it  will  be  difficult  to  impose  worthwhile
changes  in  the  field  of  new  offerings  because  the  abuses  are  so
largely the result of the publics own heedlessness and greed but the
matter deserves long and careful consideration

prevent investors from overdosing on their own greed not even commu

to describe  tyco  international  ltd  we  can  only  paraphrase  winston
churchill and say that never has so much been sold by so many to so
few from 1997 through 2001 this bermudabased conglomerate spent
a total of more than 37 billionmost of it in shares of tyco stockbuying
companies  the  way  imelda  marcos  bought  shoes  in  fiscal  year  2000
alone according to its annual report tyco acquired approximately 200
companiesan average of more than one every other day

the  result  tyco  grew  phenomenally  fast  in  five  years  revenues
went from 76 billion to 34 billion and operating income shot from a
476 million loss to a 62 billion gain no wonder the company had a
total stockmarket value of 114 billion at the end of 2001

but tycos financial statements were at least as mindboggling as
its growth nearly every year they featured hundreds of millions of dol
lars in acquisitionrelated charges these expenses fell into three main
categories

1 merger or restructuring or other nonrecurring costs
2 charges for the impairment of longlived assets and
3 writeoffs of purchased inprocess research and development

for  the  sake  of  brevity  let us  refer  to  the  first  kind  of  charge  as
moron the second as chilla and the third as woopiprad how
did they show up over time

as you can see the moron chargeswhich are supposed to be
nonrecurringshowed up in four out of five years and totaled a whopping
25  billion  chilla  cropped  up  just  as  chronically  and  amounted  to
more than 700 million woopiprad came to another halfbillion dol
lars3

the intelligent investor would ask







if tycos strategy of growththroughacquisition was such a neat
idea how come it had to spend an average of 750 million a year
cleaning up after itself
if as seems clear tyco was not in the business of making things
but  rather  in  the  business  of  buying  other  companies  that  make
thingsthen  why  were  its  moron  charges  nonrecurring
were not they just part of tycos normal costs of doing business
and with accounting charges for past acquisitions junking up every
years earnings who could tell what next years would be

3 when accounting for acquisitions loading up on woopiprad enabled
tyco to reduce the portion of the purchase price that it allocated to goodwill
since woopiprad can be expensed up front while goodwill under the
accounting rules then in force had to be written off over multiyear periods
this maneuver enabled tyco to minimize the impact of goodwill charges on
its future earnings

in  fact  an  investor  could not  even  tell  what  tycos  past earnings
were in 1999 after an accounting review by the us securities and

curring costs had actually recurred in that year too at the same time

what kind of business did buyers get for that price etoys sales
had risen 4261 in the previous year and it had added 75000 cus
tomers  in  the  last  quarter  alone  but  in  its  20  months  in  business
etoys had produced total sales of 306 million on which it had run a
net loss of 308 millionmeaning that etoys was spending 2 to sell
every dollars worth of toys

the  ipo  prospectus  also  disclosed  that  etoys  would  use  some
proceeds  of  the  offering  to  acquire  another  online  operation  baby

the previous year to land this prize etoys would pay a mere 205

a comparison of eight pairs of companies

in  this  chapter  we  shall  attempt  a  novel  form  of  exposition  by
selecting eight pairs of companies which appear next to each other
or nearly so on the stockexchange list we hope to bring home in a
concrete and vivid manner some of the many varieties of character
financial  structure  policies  performance  and  vicissitudes  of  cor
porate enterprises and of the investment and speculative attitudes
found on the financial scene in recent years in each comparison we
shall comment only on those aspects that have a special meaning
and import

pair i real estate investment trust stores offices factories
etc and realty equities corp of new york real estate
investment general construction

in  this  first  comparison  we  depart  from  the  alphabetical  order
used for the other pairs it has a special significance for us since it
seems  to  encapsulate  on  the  one  hand  all  that  has  been  reason
able  stable  and  generally  good  in  the  traditional  methods  of 
handling  other  peoples  money  in  contrastin  the  other  com
panywith the reckless expansion the financial legerdemain and
the rollercoaster changes so often found in presentday corporate
operations the two enterprises have similar names and for many
years they appeared side by side on the american stock exchange
list their stockticker symbolsrei and reccould easily have
been  confused  but  one  of  them  is  a  staid  new  england  trust
administered by three trustees with operations dating back nearly
a century and with dividends paid continuously since 1889 it has
kept throughout to the same type of prudent investments limiting

the other is a typical new yorkbased suddengrowth venture
which  in  eight  years  blew  up  its  assets  from  62  million  to  154
million  and  its  debts  in  the  same  proportion  which  moved  out
from  ordinary  realestate  operations  to  a  miscellany  of  ventures
including two racetracks 74 movie theaters three literary agencies
a publicrelations firm hotels supermarkets and a 26 interest in
a  large  cosmetics  firm  which  went  bankrupt  in  1970  this  con
glomeration of business ventures was matched by a corresponding
variety of corporate devices including the following

par value of only 1 and carried as a liability at 1 per share
2 a stated  commonstock  value  of  2500000  1  per  share

the trust had kept the noiseless tenor of its way increasing both
its  revenues  and  its  pershare  earnings  by  about  threequarters

strous and vulnerable

how  did  wall  street  react  to  these  diverse  developments  by
paying as little attention as possible to the trust and a lot to realty
equities  in  1968  the  latter  shot  up  from  10  to  3734 and  the  listed
warrants  from  6  to  3612  on  combined  sales  of  2420000  shares
while this was happening the trust shares advanced sedately from
20  to  3014 on  modest  volume  the  march  1969  balance  sheet  of

the intelligent investor

the next year it became clear that all was not well in the equities
picture  and  the  price  fell  to  912  when  the  report  for  march  1970
appeared  the  shareholders  must  have  felt  shellshocked  as  they
read that the enterprise had sustained a net loss of 13200000 or
517  per  sharevirtually  wiping  out  their  former  slim  equity
this  disastrous  figure  included  a  reserve  of  8800000  for  future
losses  on  investments  nonetheless  the  directors  had  bravely  
declared an extra dividend of 5 cents right after the close of the fis
cal  year  but  more  trouble  was  in  sight  the  companys  auditors
refused  to  certify  the  financial  statements  for  196970  and  the
shares  were  suspended  from  trading  on  the  american  stock
exchange  in  the  overthecounter  market  the  bid  price  dropped
below 2 per share

real estate investment trust shares had typical price fluctuations
after 1969 the low in 1970 was 1612 with a recovery to 2656 in early
1971 the latest reported earnings were 150 per share and the stock
was selling moderately above its 1970 book value of 2160 the issue
may have been somewhat overpriced at its record high in 1968 but the
shareholders  have  been  honestly  and  well  served  by  their  trustees
the real estate equities story is a different and a sorry one

pair 2 air products and chemicals industrial and medical
gases etc and air reduction co industrial gases and
equipment chemicals

even more than our first pair these two resemble each other in
both name and line of business the comparison they invite is thus
of  the  conventional  type  in  security  analysis  while  most  of  our
other pairs are more heteroclite in nature products is a newer

sive realty trusts

company  than  reduction  and  in  1969  had  less  than  half  the
others volume nonetheless its equity issues sold for 25 more in
the aggregate than air reductions stock as table 182 shows the
reason  can  be  found  both  in air  reductions  greater  profitability
and in its stronger growth record we find here the typical conse
quences of a better showing of quality air products sold at 1612
times  its  latest  earnings  against  only  91  times  for air  reduction
also  air  products  sold  well  above  its  asset  backing  while  air
reduction  could  be  bought  at  only  75  of  its  book  value  air
reduction paid a more liberal dividend but this may be deemed to
reflect  the  greater  desirability  for  air  products  to  retain  its  earn
ings also air reduction had a more comfortable workingcapital
position on this point we may remark that a profitable company
can always put its current position in shape by some form of per
manent  financing  but  by  our  standards air  products  was  some
what overbonded

if the analyst were called on to choose between the two compa
nies he would have no difficulty in concluding that the prospects
of air  products  looked  more  promising  than  those  of air  reduc
tion but did this make air products more attractive at its consider
ably higher relative price we doubt whether this question can be
answered in a definitive fashion in general wall street sets qual
ity above quantity in its thinking and probably the majority of
security  analysts  would  opt  for  the  better  but  dearer air  prod
ucts  as  against  the  poorer  but  cheaper air  reduction  whether
this preference is to prove right or wrong is more likely to depend
on the unpredictable future than on any demonstrable investment
principle in this instance air reduction appears to belong to the
group of important companies in the lowmultiplier class if as the
studies referred to above would seem to indicate that group as a

whole is  likely  to  give  a  better  account  of  itself  than  the  high
multiplier stocks then air reduction should logically be given the
preferencebut  only  as  part  of  a  diversified  operation  also  a
thoroughgoing study of the individual companies could lead the
analyst  to  the  opposite  conclusion  but  that  would  have  to  be  for
reasons beyond those already reflected in the past showing

sequel air products stood up better than air reduction in the

much  more  for  the  money  in  terms  of  current  or  past  earnings
and dividends the very low book value of home illustrates a basic
ambiguity or contradiction in commonstock analysis on the one
hand  it  means  that  the  company  is  earning  a  high  return  on  its
capitalwhich in general is a sign of strength and prosperity on
the other it means that the investor at the current price would be
especially  vulnerable  to  any  important  adverse  change  in  the
companys  earnings  situation  since  hospital  was  selling  at  over
four times its book value in 1969 this cautionary remark must be
applied to both companies

a comparison of eight pairs of companies

455

conclusions our clearcut view would be that both companies
were  too  rich  at  their  current  prices  to  be  considered  by  the
investor who decides to follow our ideas of conservative selection
this  does  not  mean  that  the  companies  were  lacking  in  promise
the trouble is rather that their price contained too much prom
ise  and  not  enough  actual  performance  for  the  two  enterprises
combined  the  1969  price  reflected  almost  5  billion  of  goodwill
valuation  how  many  years  of  excellent  future  earnings  would  it
take to realize that goodwill factor in the form of dividends or
tangible assets

shortterm sequel  at  the  end  of  1969  the  market  evidently
thought more highly of the earnings prospects of hospital than of
home since it gave the former almost twice the multiplier of the
latter  as  it  happened  the  favored  issue  showed  a  microscopic
decline in earnings in 1970 while home turned in a respectable 8
gain the market price of hospital reacted significantly to this one
year  disappointment  it  sold  at  32  in  february  1971a  loss  of
about  30  from  its  1969  closewhile  home  was  quoted  slightly
above its corresponding level

pair 4 h  r block inc incometax service and blue bell

these  companies  rub  shoulders  as  relative  newcomers  to  the
new york stock exchange where they represent two very different
genres  of  success  stories  blue  bell  came  up  the  hard  way  in  a
highly  competitive  industry  in  which  eventually  it  became  the
largest factor its earnings have fluctuated somewhat with industry
conditions  but  their  growth  since  1965  has  been  impressive  the
companys operations go back to 1916 and its continuous dividend
record  to  1923  at  the  end  of  1969  the  stock  market  showed  no
enthusiasm for the issue giving it a priceearnings ratio of only 11
against about 17 for the s  p composite index

published figures date only to 1961 in which year it earned 83000
on revenues of 610000 but eight years later on our comparison
date  its  revenues  had  soared  to  536  million  and  its  net  to  63
million at  that  time  the  stock  markets  attitude  toward  this  fine
performer  appeared  nothing  less  than  ecstatic  the  price  of  55  at
the  close  of  1969  was  more  than  100  times  the  last  reported  12
months  earningswhich  of  course  were  the  largest  to  date  the
aggregate  market  value  of  300  million  for  the  stock  issue  was
nearly  30  times  the  tangible  assets  behind  the  shares  this  was
almost unheard of in the annals of serious stockmarket valuations
at  that  time  ibm  was  selling  at  about  9  times  and  xerox  at  11
times book value

our  table  184  sets  forth  in  dollar  figures  and  in  ratios  the
extraordinary discrepancy in the comparative valuations of block
and  blue  bell  true  block  showed  twice  the  profitability  of  blue
bell  per  dollar  of  capital  and  its  percentage  growth  in  earnings
over  the  past  five  years  from  practically  nothing  was  much
higher but as a stock enterprise blue bell was selling for less than
onethird  the  total  value  of  block  although  blue  bell  was  doing
four  times  as  much  business  earning  212 times  as  much  for  its
stock had 512 times as much in tangible investment and gave nine
times the dividend yield on the price

indicated conclusions  an  experienced  analyst  would  have
conceded great momentum to block implying excellent prospects
for future growth he might have had some qualms about the dan
gers of serious competition in the incometaxservice field lured by
the handsome return on capital realized by block1 but mindful of
the  continued  success  of  such  outstanding  companies  as  avon
products  in  highly  competitive  areas  he  would  have  hesitated  to
predict a speedy flattening out of the block growth curve his chief

 nearly  30  times  is  reflected  in  the  entry  of  2920  under  pricebook

tech companies sold for hundreds of times their asset value see the com
mentary  on  this  chapter  talk  about  almost  unheard  of  in  the  annals  of

concern  would  be  simply  whether  the  300  million  valuation  for
the company had not already fully valued and perhaps overvalued
all  that  one  could  reasonably  expect  from  this  excellent  business
by contrast the analyst should have had little difficulty in recom
mending blue bell as a fine company quite conservatively priced

pair 5 international flavors  fragrances flavors etc for

manufacturer farm machinery construction machinery

this comparison should carry more than one surprise everyone
knows of international harvester one of the 30 giants in the dow
jones  industrial  average  how  many  of  our  readers  have  even
heard of international flavors  fragrances nextdoor neighbor to
harvester on the new york stock exchange list yet mirabile dictu
iff was actually selling at the end of 1969 for a higher aggregate
market  value  than  harvester747  million  versus  710  million
this is the more amazing when one reflects that harvester had 17
times the stock capital of flavors and 27 times the annual sales in

 graham  is  alerting  readers  to  a  form  of  the  gamblers  fallacy  in  which
investors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price purely because
it is overvalued just as a coin does not become more likely to turn up heads
after landing on tails for nine times in a row so an overvalued stock or stock
market can stay overvalued for a surprisingly long time that makes short
selling or betting that stocks will drop too risky for mere mortals
 international  harvester  was  the  heir  to  mccormick  harvesting  machine
co the manufacturer of the mccormick reaper that helped make the mid
western  states  the  breadbasket  of  the  world  but  international  harvester
fell on hard times in the 1970s and in 1985 sold its farmequipment busi
ness to tenneco after changing its name to navistar the remaining com
pany was booted from the dow in 1991 although it remains a member of
the s  p 500 index international flavors  fragrances also a constituent
of the s  p 500 had a total stockmarket value of 3 billion in early 2003

fact only three years before the net earnings of harvester had been
larger than the 1969 sales of flavors how did these extraordinary
disparities develop the answer lies in the two magic words prof
itability and growth flavors made a remarkable showing in both
categories while harvester left everything to be desired

the story is told in table 185 here we find flavors with a sen
sational profit of 143 of sales before income tax the figure was
23 compared with a mere 26 for harvester similarly flavors

460

the intelligent investor

had  earned  197  on  its  stock  capital  against  an  inadequate  55
earned by harvester in five years the net earnings of flavors had
nearly  doubled  while  those  of  harvester  practically  stood  still
between  1969  and  1959  the  comparison  makes  similar  reading
these differences in performance produced a typical stockmarket
divergence  in  valuation  flavors  sold  in  1969  at  55  times  its  last
reported earnings and harvester at only 107 times correspond
ingly flavors was valued at 104 times its book value while har
vester was selling at a 41 discount from its net worth

comment and conclusions the first thing to remark is that the
market success of flavors was based entirely on the development
of its central business and involved none of the corporate wheel
ing  and  dealing  acquisition  programs  topheavy  capitalization
structures and other familiar wall street practices of recent years
the  company  has  stuck  to  its  extremely  profitable  knitting  and
that is virtually its whole story the record of harvester raises an
entirely different set of questions but these too have nothing to do
with high finance why have so many great companies become
relatively unprofitable even during many years of general prosper
ity what is the advantage of doing more than 212 billion of busi
ness 
justify  the
shareholders investment it is not for us to prescribe the solution
of  this  problem  but  we  insist  that  not  only  management  but  the
rank and file of shareholders should be conscious that the problem
exists and that it calls for the best brains and the best efforts possi
ble  to  deal  with  it  from  the  standpoint  of  commonstock  selec
tion  neither  issue  would  have  met  our  standards  of  sound
reasonably  attractive  and  moderately  priced  investment  flavors
was  a  typical  brilliantly  successful  but  lavishly  valued  company

if  the  enterprise  cannot  earn  enough  to 

 for more of grahams thoughts on shareholder activism see the commen
tary on chapter 19 in criticizing harvester for its refusal to maximize share
holder value graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of the companys
future  management  in  2001  a  majority  of  shareholders  voted  to  remove
navistars restrictions against outside takeover bidsbut the board of direc
tors simply refused to implement the shareholders wishes its remarkable
that  an  antidemocratic  tendency  in  the  culture  of  some  companies  can
endure for decades

461

harvesters showing was too mediocre to make it really attractive
even  at  its  discount  price  undoubtedly  there  were  better  values
available in the reasonably priced class

sequel to 1971  the  low  price  of  harvester  at  the  end  of  1969
protected it from a large further decline in the bad break of 1970 it
lost only 10 more flavors proved more vulnerable and declined
to  45  a  loss  of  30  in  the  subsequent  recovery  both  advanced
well above their 1969 close but harvester soon fell back to the 25
level

pair 6 mcgraw edison public utility and equipment
housewares mcgrawhill inc books films instruction
systems magazine and newspaper publishers information
services

this  pair  with  so  similar  nameswhich  at  times  we  shall  call
edison and hillare two large and successful enterprises in vastly
different fields we have chosen december 31 1968 as the date of
our comparison developed in table 186 the issues were selling at
about the same price but because of hills larger capitalization it
was valued at about twice the total figure of the other this differ
ence should appear somewhat surprising since edison had about
50 higher sales and onequarter larger net earnings as a result
we find that the key ratiothe multiplier of earningswas more
than twice as great for hill as for edison this phenomenon seems
explicable  chiefly  by  the  persistence  of  a  strong  enthusiasm  and
partiality  exhibited  by  the  market  toward  shares  of  book
publishing  companies  several  of  which  had  been  introduced  to
public trading in the later 1960s

actually by the end of 1968 it was evident that this enthusiasm
had  been  overdone  the  hill  shares  had  sold  at  56  in  1967  more
than 40 times the justreported record earnings for 1966 but a small
decline had appeared in 1967 and a further decline in 1968 thus the
current high multiplier of 35 was being applied to a company that

 mcgrawhill remains a publiclytraded company that owns among other
operations businessweek magazine  and  standard    poors  corp
mcgrawedison is now a division of cooper industries

82 per share in the may 1970 debacle its price suffered a devas

pair 7 national general corp a large conglomerate and
national presto industries diverse electric appliances
ordnance

these  two  companies  invite  comparison  chiefly  because  they
are so different let us call them general and presto we have
selected the end of 1968 for our study because the writeoffs taken
by general in 1969 made the figures for that year too ambiguous
the full flavor of generals farflung activities could not be savored
the  year  before  but  it  was  already  conglomerate  enough  for
anyones taste the condensed description in the stock guide read
nationwide  theatre  chain  motion  picture  and  tv  production
savings  and  loan  assn  book  publishing  to  which  could  be
added  then  or  later  insurance  investment  banking  records
music publishing computerized services real estateand 35 of
performance  systems  inc  name  recently  changed  from  minnie
pearls chicken system inc presto had also followed a diversifi
cation  program  but  in  comparison  with  general  it  was  modest
indeed  starting  as  the  leading  maker  of  pressure  cookers  it  had
branched out into various other household and electric appliances
quite  differently  also  it  took  on  a  number  of  ordnance  contracts
for the us government

 in the may 1970 debacle that graham refers to the us stock market
lost 55 from the end of march to the end of june 1970 the s  p 500
index lost 19 of its value one of the worst threemonth returns on record

464

the intelligent investor

our table 187 summarizes the showing of the companies at the
end  of  1968  the  capital  structure  of  presto  was  as  simple  as  it
could benothing but 1478000 shares of common stock selling in
the market for 58 million contrastingly general had more than
twice as many shares of common plus an issue of convertible pre
ferred  plus  three  issues  of  stock  warrants  calling  for  a  huge
amount  of  common  plus  a  towering  convertible  bond  issue  just
given  in  exchange  for  stock  of  an  insurance  company  plus  a
goodly sum of nonconvertible bonds all this added up to a market
capitalization of 534 million not counting an impending issue of
convertible bonds and 750 million including such issue despite
national generals enormously greater capitalization it had actu
ally done considerably less gross business than presto in their fiscal
years and it had shown only 75 of prestos net income

the determination of the true market value of generals common
stock  capitalization  presents  an  interesting  problem  for  security
analysts  and  has  important  implications  for  anyone  interested  in
the  stock  on  any  basis  more  serious  than  outright  gambling  the
relatively small 412 convertible preferred can be readily taken care
of by assuming its conversion into common when the latter sells at
a  suitable  market  level  this  we  have  done  in  table  187  but  the
warrants  require  different  treatment  in  calculating  the  full  dilu
tion basis the company assumes exercise of all the warrants and
the application of the proceeds to the retirement of debt plus use of
the  balance  to  buy  in  common  at  the  market  these  assumptions
actually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in
calendar 1968which were reported as 151 both before and after
allowance  for  dilution  we  consider  this  treatment  illogical  and
unrealistic as we see it the warrants represent a part of the com
monstock package and their market value is part of the effective
market  value  of  the  commonstock  part  of  the  capital  see  our
discussion of this point on p 415 above this simple technique of
adding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has
a  radical  effect  on  the  showing  of  national  general  at  the  end  of
1968 as appears from the calculation in table 187 in fact the true
market price of the common stock turns out to be more than twice
the quoted figure hence the true multiplier of the 1968 earnings is
more  than  doubledto  the  inherently  absurd  figure  of  69  times
the  total  market  value  of  the  commonstock  equivalents  then

becomes 413 million which is over three times the tangible assets
shown therefor

these figures appear the more anomalous when comparison is
made with those of presto one is moved to ask how could presto
possibly be valued at only 69 times its current earnings when the
multiplier for general was nearly 10 times as great all the ratios of
presto are quite satisfactorythe growth figure suspiciously so in
fact by that we mean that the company was undoubtedly benefit
ing considerably from its war work and the shareholders should
be prepared for some falling off in profits under peacetime condi
tions but on balance presto met all the requirements of a sound
and  reasonably  priced  investment  while  general  had  all  the  ear
marks of a typical conglomerate of the late 1960s vintage full of
corporate gadgets and grandiose gestures but lacking in substan
tial values behind the market quotations

sequel general continued its diversification policy in 1969 with
some increase in its debt but it took a whopping writeoff of mil
lions  chiefly  in  the  value  of  its  investment  in  the  minnie  pearl
chicken deal the final figures showed a loss of 72 million before
tax credit and 464 million after tax credit the price of the shares
fell to 1612 in 1969 and as low as 9 in 1970 only 15 of its 1968 high
of 60 earnings for 1970 were reported as 233 per share diluted
and the price recovered to 2812 in 1971 national presto increased its
pershare  earnings  somewhat  in  both  1969  and  1970  marking  10
years  of  uninterrupted  growth  of  profits  nonetheless  its  price
declined to 2112 in the 1970 debacle this was an interesting figure
since it was less than four times the last reported earnings and less
than the net current assets available for the stock at the time late in
1971 we find the price of national presto 60 higher at 34 but the
ratios are still startling the enlarged working capital is still about
equal  to  the  current  price  which  in  turn  is  only  512 times  the  last
reported earnings if the investor could now find ten such issues for
diversification he could be confident of satisfactory results

 national  presto  remains  a  publiclytraded  company  national  general  was
acquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate american financial
group which at various times has had interests in cable television banking
real estate mutual funds insurance and bananas afg is also the final resting
place of some of the assets of penn central corp see chapter 17

assets for the common sold at about four times the aggregate value
of  the  other  the  highervalued  company  was  about  to  report  a
large loss after special charges it had not paid a dividend in thir
teen  years  the  other  had  a  long  record  of  satisfactory  earnings
had  paid  continuous  dividends  since  1936  and  was  currently
returning one of the highest dividend yields in the entire common
stock list to indicate more vividly the disparity in the performance
of the two companies we append in table 188b the earnings and
price record for 19611970

the history of the two companies throws an interesting light on
the  development  of  mediumsized  businesses  in  this  country  in
contrast  with  much  largersized  companies  that  have  mainly
appeared  in  these  pages  whiting  was  incorporated  in  1896  and
thus goes back at least 75 years it seems to have kept pretty faith
fully  to  its  materialshandling  business  and  has  done  quite  well
with it over the decades willcox  gibbs goes back even farther
to 1866and was long known in its industry as a prominent maker

of industrial sewing machines during the past decade it adopted a
policy  of  diversification  in  what  seems  a  rather  outlandish  form
for on the one hand it has an extraordinarily large number of sub
sidiary  companies  at  least  24  making  an  astonishing  variety  of
products but on the other hand the entire conglomeration adds up
to mighty small potatoes by usual wall street standards

the earnings developments in whiting are rather characteristic
of our business concerns the figures show steady and rather spec
tacular growth from 41 cents a share in 1960 to 363 in 1968 but
they carried no assurance that such growth must continue indefi
nitely  the  subsequent  decline  to  only  177  for  the  12  months
ended  january  1971  may  have  reflected  nothing  more  than  the
slowing down of the general economy but the stock price reacted
in severe fashion falling about 60 from its 1968 high 4312 to the
close  of  1969  our  analysis  would  indicate  that  the  shares  repre
sented  a  sound  and  attractive  secondaryissue  investmentsuit
able  for  the  enterprising  investor  as  part  of  a  group  of  such
commitments

sequel willcox  gibbs showed a small operating loss for 1970
its  price  declined  drastically  to  a  low  of  412  recovering  in  typical
fashion to 912 in february 1971 it would be hard to justify that price
statistically whiting had a relatively small decline to 1634 in 1970
at  that  price  it  was  selling  at  just  about  the  current  assets  alone
available for the shares its earnings held at 185 per share to july
1971 in early 1971 the price advanced to 2412 which seemed rea
sonable enough but no longer a bargain by our standards

general observations

the issues used in these comparisons were selected with some
malice aforethought and thus they cannot be said to present a ran
dom crosssection of the commonstock list also they are limited
to the industrial section and the important areas of public utilities

 whiting corp ended up a subsidiary of wheelabratorfrye but was taken
private in 1983 willcox  gibbs is now owned by group rexel an electri

the intelligent investor

transportation companies and financial enterprises do not appear
but they vary sufficiently in size lines of business and qualitative
and  quantitative  aspects  to  convey  a  fair  idea  of  the  choices  con
fronting an investor in common stocks

the relationship between price and indicated value has also dif
fered greatly from one case to another for the most part the compa
nies with better growth records and higher profitability have sold at
higher multipliers of current earningswhich is logical enough in

general whether the specific differentials in priceearnings ratios
are justified by the factsor will be vindicated by future devel
opmentscannot be answered with confidence on the other hand
we do have quite a few instances here in which a worthwhile judg
ment  can  be  reached  these  include  virtually  all  the  cases  where
there has been great market activity in companies of questionable
underlying  soundness  such  stocks  not  only  were  speculative
which  means  inherently  riskybut  a  good  deal  of  the  time  they
were  and  are  obviously  overvalued  other  issues  appeared  to  be
worth more than their price being affected by the opposite sort of
market attitudewhich we might call underspeculationor by
undue pessimism because of a shrinkage in earnings

in table 189 we provide some data on the price fluctuations of
the issues covered in this chapter most of them had large declines
between  1961  and  1962  as  well  as  from  1969  to  1970  clearly  the
investor  must  be  prepared  for  this  type  of  adverse  market  move

fluctuations  of  mcgrawhill  common  stock  for  the  period
19581970 it will be noted that in each of the last 13 years the price
either  advanced  or  declined  over  a  range  of  at  least  three  to  two
from one year to the next in the case of national general fluctua
tions of at least this amplitude both upward and downward were
shown in each twoyear period

in  studying  the  stock  list  for  the  material  in  this  chapter  we
were  impressed  once  again  by  the  wide  difference  between  the
usual  objectives  of  security  analysis  and  those  we  deem  depend
able and rewarding most security analysts try to select the issues
that will give the best account of themselves in the future in terms
chiefly  of  market  action  but  considering  also  the  development  of
earnings we are frankly skeptical as to whether this can be done
with  satisfactory  results  our  preference  for  the  analysts  work
would  be  rather  that  he  should  seek  the  exceptional  or  minority
cases in which he can form a reasonably confident judgment that
the  price  is  well  below  value  he  should  be  able  to  do  this  work
with  sufficient  expertness  to  produce  satisfactory  average  results
over the years

its  well  established  that  people  often  assign  a  mental  value  to
stocks based largely on the emotional imagery that companies evoke1
but the intelligent investor always digs deeper here is what a skeptical
look at cisco and syscos financial statements would have turned up

 much  of  ciscos  growth  in  revenues  and  earnings  came  from
acquisitions since september alone cisco had ponied up 102
billion to buy 11 other firms how could so many companies be
mashed  together  so  quickly 2 also  roughly  a  third  of  ciscos

more money see paul slovic melissa finucane ellen peters and donald

earnings  over  the  previous  six  months  came  not  from  its  busi
nesses  but  from  tax  breaks  on  stock  options  exercised  by  its
executives  and  employees  and  cisco  had  gained  58  billion
selling investments then bought 6 billion more was it an inter
net  company  or  a  mutual  fund  what  if  those  investments
stopped going up
sysco  had  also  acquired  several  companies  over  the  same
periodbut  paid  only  about  130  million  stock  options  for
syscos insiders totaled only 15 of shares outstanding versus
69 at cisco if insiders cashed their options syscos earnings
per  share  would  be  diluted  much  less  than  ciscos  and  sysco
had  raised  its  quarterly  dividend  from  nine  cents  a  share  to  10
cisco paid no dividend

finally as wharton finance professor jeremy siegel pointed out no
company as big as cisco had ever been able to grow fast enough to
justify a priceearnings ratio above 60let alone a pe ratio over 2003
once a company becomes a giant its growth must slow downor it
will  end  up  eating  the  entire  world  the  great  american  satirist
ambrose  bierce  coined  the  word  incompossible  to  describe  two
things  that  are  conceivable  separately  but  cannot  exist  together  a
company can be a giant or it can deserve a giant pe ratio but both
together are incompossible

the  wheels  soon  came  off  the  cisco  juggernaut  first  in  2001
came  a  12  billion  charge  to  restructure  some  of  those  acquisi
tions over the next two years 13 billion in losses on those invest
ments  leaked  out  from  2000  through  2002  ciscos  stock  lost
threequarters of its value sysco meanwhile kept dishing out profits

a  636  gain  in  five  trading  days  yahoo  kept  whooping  along
through yearend closing at 432687 on december 31 in a single
month the stock had more than doubled gaining roughly 58 billion
to reach a total market value of 114 billion4

in the previous four quarters yahoo had racked up 433 million in
revenues and 349 million in net income so yahoos stock was now
priced at 263 times revenues and 3264 times earnings remember
that a pe ratio much above 25 made graham grimace5

why  was  yahoo  screaming  upward  after  the  market  closed  on
november 30 standard  poors announced that it would add yahoo
to its s  p 500 index as of december 7 that would make yahoo a
compulsory holding for index funds and other big investorsand that
sudden  rise  in  demand  was  sure  to  drive  the  stock  even  higher  at
least temporarily with some 90 of yahoos stock locked up in the
hands of employees venturecapital firms and other restricted hold
ers just a fraction of its shares could trade so thousands of people
bought the stock only because they knew other people would have to
buy itand price was no object

4 yahoos stock split twoforone in february 2000 the share prices given
here are not adjusted for that split in order to show the levels the stock actu
ally  traded  at  but  yahoos  percentage  return  and  market  value  as  cited
here do reflect the split

was only 59 billion or 119 of yahoos capitalization at that price
yums stock was selling at just over nine times its earnings and only
73 of its revenues6

as  graham  liked  to  say  in  the  short  run  the  market  is  a  voting
machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine yahoo won the
shortterm popularity contest but in the end its earnings that matter

lion on only 34 million in total revenues the stock of this minuscule

capitalization  of  15  billion was  it  overpriced  yes  we  have  a  big

shrugged in an interview but we have a big market to play in were
seeing incredible demand    analysts expect us to make 140 mil
lion in revenue this year and in the past we have exceeded expecta
tions

two things jump out from hoffmans answer





since  commerce  one  was  already  losing  2  on  every  dollar  in
sales if it quadrupled its revenues as analysts expect would not
it lose money even more massively
how could commerce one have exceeded expectations in the
past what past

asked whether his company would ever turn a profit hoffman was
ready  there  is  no  question  we  can  turn  this  into  a  profitable  busi
ness we plan on becoming profitable in the fourth quarter of 2001 a
year analysts see us making over 250 million in revenues

there come those analysts again i like commerce one at these
levels  because  its  growing  faster  than  ariba  a  close  competitor
whose  stock  was  also  trading  at  around  400  times  revenues  said
jeanette sing an analyst at the wasserstein perella investment bank
if these growth rates continue commerce one will be trading at 60
to 70 times sales in 2001 in other words i can name a stock that is

on march 2 2000 the datanetworking company 3com corp sold
5  of  its  palm  inc  subsidiary  to  the  public  the  remaining  95  of
palms  stock  would  be  spun  off  to  3coms  shareholders  in  the  next
few  months  for  each  share  of  3com  they  held  investors  would
receive 1525 shares of palm

so there were two ways you could get 100 shares of palm by try
ing to elbow your way into the ipo or by buying 66 shares of 3com
and waiting until the parent company distributed the rest of the palm
stock  getting  oneandahalf  shares  of  palm  for  each  3com  share
you would  end  up  with  100  shares  of  the  new  companyand  you would  still
have 66 shares of 3com

but who wanted to wait a few months while 3com was struggling
against giant rivals like cisco palm was a leader in the hot space of
handheld digital organizers so palms stock shot up from its offering price
of 38 to close at 9506 a 150 firstday return that valued palm at
more than 1350 times its earnings over the previous 12 months

that  same  day  3coms  share  price  dropped from  10413  to
8181 where should 3com have closed that day given the price of
palm the arithmetic is easy

regulators  revealed  that  they  might  charge  him  with  violations  of  laws

each 3com share was entitled to receive 1525 shares of palm
each share of palm closed at 9506
1525 cid1 9506  14497

that is  what  each  3com  share  was  worth  based  on  its  stake  in
palm alone thus at 8181 traders were saying that all of 3coms
other businesses combined were worth a negative 6316 per share
or a total of minus 22 billion rarely in history has any stock been
priced more stupidly9

but  there  was  a  catch  just  as  3com  was not  really  worth  minus
22  billion  palm  was not  really  worth  over  1350  times  earnings  by
the end of 2002 both stocks were hurting in the hightech recession
but it was palms shareholders who really got smackedbecause they
abandoned all common sense when they bought in the first place

the year 2000 started off with a bang for cmgi inc as the stock hit
16322 on january 3a gain of 1126 over its price just one year
before  the  company  an  internet  incubator  financed  and  acquired
startup firms in a variety of online businessesamong them such early
stars as theglobecom and lycos10

cmgi spent 538 million acquiring whole or partial stakes in internet
companies  in  fiscal  year  1999  as  its  stock  shot  from  852  to

could afford to buy the higher its stock went first stocks would go up
on the rumor that cmgi might buy them then once cmgi acquired
them  its  own  stock  would  go  up  because  it  owned  them  no  one
cared that cmgi had lost 127 million on its operations in the latest
fiscal year

cmgis  headquarters  in  andover  sits  the  main  office  of  commerce

between  july  9  and  july  23  2002  ball  corps  stock  dropped  from
4369 to 3348a loss of 24 that left the company with a stock
market value of 19 billion over the same two weeks stryker corps
shares fell from 4955 to 4560 an 8 drop that left strkyer valued
at a total of 9 billion

what  had  made  these  two  companies  worth  so  much  less  in  so
short  a  time  stryker  which  manufactures  orthopedic  implants  and
surgical  equipment  issued  only  one  press  release  during  those  two
weeks  on  july  16  stryker  announced  that  its  sales  grew  15  to
734  million  in  the  second  quarter  while  earnings  jumped  31  to
86  million  the  stock  rose  7  the  next  day  then  rolled  right  back
downhill

ball the original maker of the famous ball jars used for canning
fruits  and  vegetables  now  makes  metal  and  plastic  packaging  for
industrial customers ball issued no press releases at all during those
two weeks on july 25 however ball reported that it had earned 50
million on sales of 1 billion in the second quartera 61 rise in net
income over the same period one year earlier that brought its earn
ings over the trailing four quarters to 152 million so the stock was
trading  at  just  125  times  balls  earnings  and  with  a  book  value  of
11 billion you could buy the stock for 17 times what the companys
tangible  assets  were  worth  ball  did  however  have  just  over  900
million in debt

stryker  was  in  a  different  league  over  the  last  four  quarters  the
company  had  generated  301  million  in  net  income  strykers  book
value was 570 million so the company was trading at fat multiples of
30 times its earnings over the past 12 months and nearly 16 times its
book value on the other hand from 1992 through the end of 2001
strykers earnings had risen 186 annually its dividend had grown

commentary on chapter 18

by nearly 21 per year and in 2001 stryker had spent 142 million
on research and development to lay the groundwork for future growth
what then had pounded these two stocks down between july 9
and july 23 2002 as worldcom keeled over into bankruptcy the dow
jones  industrial  average  fell  from  909609  to  770234  a  153
plunge the good news at ball and stryker got lost in the bad headlines
and falling markets which took these two stocks down with them

although ball ended up priced far more cheaply than stryker the
lesson here is not that ball was a steal and stryker was a wild pitch
instead  the  intelligent  investor  should  recognize  that  market  panics
can  create  great  prices  for  good  companies  like  ball  and  good
prices for great companies like stryker ball finished 2002 at 5119

the company would produce in 2000

how  credible  was  that  estimate  nortels  accounts  receivable
sales to customers that had not yet paid the billhad shot up by 1
billion in a year the company said the rise was driven by increased
sales in the fourth quarter of 1999 however inventories had also bal

even faster than those increased sales could unload it

on the other hand nortels price87 times the guesstimate of what it

in the short run but they are always revalidated in the end if you buy a
stock purely because its price has been going upinstead of asking

shareholders and managements 

dividend policy

ever since 1934 we have argued in our writings for a more intelli
gent and energetic attitude by shareholders toward their manage
ments  we  have  asked  them  to  take  a  generous  attitude  toward
those  who  are  demonstrably  doing  a  good  job  we  have  asked
them  also  to  demand  clear  and  satisfying  explanations  when  the
results  appear  to  be  worse  than  they  should  be  and  to  support
movements  to  improve  or  remove  clearly  unproductive  manage
ments shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the com
petence of the management when the results 1 are unsatisfactory
in themselves 2 are poorer than those obtained by other compa
nies  that  appear  similarly  situated  and  3  have  resulted  in  an
unsatisfactory market price of long duration

in the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been accom
plished through intelligent action by the great body of sharehold
ers a sensible crusaderif there are any suchwould take this as
a  sign  that  he  has  been  wasting  his  time  and  that  he  had  better
give up the fight as it happens our because has not been lost it has
been  rescued  by  an  extraneous  developmentknown  as  take
overs or takeover bids we said in chapter 8 that poor manage

 ironically  takeovers  began  drying  up  shortly  after  grahams  last  revised
edition appeared and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the absolute low
point  of  modern  american  industrial  efficiency  cars  were  lemons  televi
sions and radios were constantly on the fritz and the managers of many
publiclytraded  companies  ignored  both  the  present  interests  of  their  out
side shareholders and the future prospects of their own businesses all of

ments produce poor market prices the low market prices in turn
attract  the  attention  of  companies  interested  in  diversifying  their
operationsand these are now legion innumerable such acquisi
tions have been accomplished by agreement with the existing man
agements or else by accumulation of shares in the market and by
offers  made  over  the  head  of  those  in  control  the  price  bid  has
usually been within the range of the value of the enterprise under
reasonably  competent  management  hence  in  many  cases  the
inert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions of out
siderswho at times may be enterprising individuals or groups
acting on their own

it  can  be  stated  as  a  rule  with  very  few  exceptions  that  poor
managements are not changed by action of the public stockhold
ers but only by the assertion of control by an individual or com
pact group this is happening often enough these days to put the
management including the board of directors of a typical publicly
controlled company on notice that if its operating results and the
resulting market price are highly unsatisfactory it may become the
target of a successful takeover move as a consequence boards of
directors have probably become more alive than previously to their
fundamental duty to see that their company has a satisfactory top
management many more changes of presidents have been seen in
recent years than formerly

not  all  companies  in  the  unsatisfactory  class  have  benefited
from such developments also the change has often occurred after
a  long  period  of  bad  results  without  remedial  action  and  has
depended on enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low
prices  to  permit  the  energetic  outsiders  to  acquire  a  controlling
position in the shares but the idea that public shareholders could
really  help  themselves  by  supporting  moves  for  improving  man
agement and management policies has proved too quixotic to war

this began to change in 1984 when independent oilman t boone pickens
launched  a  hostile  takeover  bid  for  gulf  oil  soon  fueled  by  junkbond
financing provided by drexel burnham lambert corporate raiders stalked
the landscape of corporate america scaring longsclerotic companies into
a new regimen of efficiency while many of the companies involved in buy
outs and takeovers were ravaged the rest of american business emerged

rant further space in this book those individual shareholders who
have enough gumption to make their presence felt at annual meet
ingsgenerally  a  completely  futile  performancewill  not  need
our  counsel  on  what  points  to  raise  with  the  managements  for
others the advice would probably be wasted nevertheless let us
close this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an
open mind and with careful attention any proxy material sent them
by fellowshareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatis
factory management situation in the company

shareholders and dividend policy

in the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of
argument  between  public  or  minority  shareholders  and  man
agements in general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi
dends  while  the  managements  preferred  to  keep  the  earnings  in
the  business  to  strengthen  the  company  they  asked  the  share
holders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter
prise and for their own future longterm benefit but in recent years
the attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a
gradual but significant change the basic argument now for paying
small  rather  than  liberal  dividends  is  not  that  the  company
needs the money but rather that it can use it to the shareholders
direct  and  immediate  advantage  by  retaining  the  funds  for  prof
itable expansion years ago it was typically the weak company that
was more or less forced to hold on to its profits instead of paying
out  the  usual  60  to  75  of  them  in  dividends  the  effect  was
almost always adverse to the market price of the shares nowadays
it is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber
ately  keeps  down  its  dividend  payments  with  the  approval  of
investors and speculators alike

there was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof

 the irony that graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s
when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was the less likely it
was  to  pay  a  dividendor  for  its  shareholders  to  want  one  the  payout
ratio or the percentage of their net income that companies paid out as div
idends dropped from 60 to 75 in grahams day to 35 to 40 by
the end of the 1990s

490

the intelligent investor

its  in  the  business  where  such  retention  could  be  counted  on  to
produce  a  goodly  increase  in  earnings  but  there  were  several
strong  counterarguments  such  as  the  profits  belong  to  the
shareholders  and  they  are  entitled  to  have  them  paid  out  within
the limits of prudent management many of the shareholders need
their dividend income to live on the earnings they receive in divi
dends are real money while those retained in the company may
or may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders
these counterarguments were so compelling in fact that the stock
market  showed  a  persistent  bias  in  favor  of  the  liberal  dividend
payers  as  against  the  companies  that  paid  no  dividends  or  rela
tively small ones1

in  the  last  20  years  the  profitable  reinvestment  theory  has
been  gaining  ground  the  better  the  past  record  of  growth  the
readier  investors  and  speculators  have  become  to  accept  a  low
payout policy so much is this true that in many cases of growth
favorites the dividend rateor even the absence of any dividend
has seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price

a striking example of this development is found in the history
of texas instruments incorporated the price of its common stock
rose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960 while earnings were advancing
from 43 cents to 391 per share and while no dividend of any kind
was paid in 1962 cash dividends were initiated but by that year
the earnings had fallen to 214 and the price had shown a spectac
ular drop to a low of 49

another  extreme  illustration  is  provided  by  superior  oil  in
1948 the company reported earnings of 3526 per share paid 3 in
dividends  and  sold  as  high  as  235  in  1953  the  dividend  was
reduced to 1 but the high price was 660 in 1957 it paid no dividend

 in  the  late  1990s  technology  companies  were  particularly  strong  advo
cates of the view that all of their earnings should be plowed back into the
business  where  they  could  earn  higher  returns  than  any  outside  share
holder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him
or  her  in  dividends  incredibly  investors  never  questioned  the  truth  of  this
patronizing daddyknowsbest principleor even realized that a companys
cash  belongs  to  the  shareholders  not  its  managers  see  the  commentary

at all and sold at 2000 this unusual issue later declined to 795 in
1962 when it earned 4950 and paid 750

investment  sentiment  is  far  from  crystallized  in  this  matter  of
dividend  policy  of  growth  companies  the  conflicting  views  are
well  illustrated  by  the  cases  of  two  of  our  very  largest  corpora
tionsamerican  telephone    telegraph  and  international  busi
ness  machines  american  tel    tel  came  to  be  regarded  as  an
issue with good growth possibilities as shown by the fact that in
1961  it  sold  at  25  times  that  years  earnings  nevertheless  the
companys cash dividend policy has remained an investment and
speculative consideration of first importance its quotation making
an active response to even rumors of an impending increase in the
dividend  rate  on  the  other  hand  comparatively  little  attention
appears to have been paid to the cash dividend on ibm which in
1960 yielded only 05 at the high price of the year and 15 at the
close  of  1970  but  in  both  cases  stock  splits  have  operated  as  a
potent stockmarket influence

the  markets  appraisal  of  cashdividend  policy  appears  to  be
developing  in  the  following  direction  where  prime  emphasis  is
not placed on growth the stock is rated as an income issue and
the  dividend  rate  retains  its  longheld  importance  as  the  prime
determinant  of  market  price at  the  other  extreme  stocks  clearly
recognized to be in the rapidgrowth category are valued primarily
in terms of the expected growth rate over say the next decade and
the cashdividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning

while  the  above  statement  may  properly  describe  present  ten
dencies  it  is  by  no  means  a  clearcut  guide  to  the  situation  in  all
common stocks and perhaps not in the majority of them for one
thing many companies occupy an intermediate position between
growth  and  nongrowth  enterprises  it  is  hard  to  say  how  much
importance should be ascribed to the growth factor in such cases
and the markets view thereof may change radically from year to
year  secondly  there  seems  to  be  something  paradoxical  about

 superior  oils  stock  price  peaked  at  2165  per  share  in  1959  when  it
paid a 4 dividend for many years superior was the highestpriced stock

the intelligent investor

requiring the companies showing slower growth to be more liberal
with their cash dividends for these are generally the less prosper
ous concerns and in the past the more prosperous the company the
greater  was  the  expectation  of  both  liberal  and  increasing  pay
ments

it  is  our  belief  that  shareholders  should  demand  of  their  man
agements either a normal payout of earningson the order say of
twothirdsor  else  a  clearcut  demonstration  that  the  reinvested
profits have produced a satisfactory increase in pershare earnings
such a demonstration could ordinarily be made in the case of a rec
ognized growth company but in many other cases a low payout is
clearly  the  because  of  an  average  market  price  that  is  below  fair
value  and  here  the  shareholders  have  every  right  to  inquire  and
probably to complain

a niggardly  policy  has  often  been  imposed  on  a  company
because its financial position is relatively weak and it has needed
all or most of its earnings plus depreciation charges to pay debts
and bolster its workingcapital position when this is so there is not
much the shareholders can say about itexcept perhaps to criticize
the  management  for  permitting  the  company  to  fall  into  such  an
unsatisfactory  financial  position  however  dividends  are  some
times  held  down  by  relatively  unprosperous  companies  for  the
declared  purpose  of  expanding  the  business  we  feel  that  such  a
policy  is  illogical  on  its  face  and  should  require  both  a  complete
explanation  and  a  convincing  defense  before  the  shareholders
should accept it in terms of the past record there is no reason a pri
ori  to  believe  that  the  owners  will  benefit  from  expansion  moves
undertaken  with  their  money  by  a  business  showing  mediocre
results and continuing its old management

stock dividends and stock splits

it is important that investors understand the essential difference
between  a  stock  dividend  properly  socalled  and  a  stock  split
the  latter  represents  a  restatement  of  the  commonstock  struc
turein a typical case by issuing two or three shares for one the
new shares are not related to specific earnings reinvested in a spe
cific past period its purpose is to establish a lower market price for
the  single  shares  presumably  because  such  lower  price  range

shareholders and managements

493

would  be  more  acceptable  to  old  and  new  shareholders  a stock
split may be carried out by what technically may be called a stock
dividend which involves a transfer of sums from earned surplus
to capital account or else by a change in par value which does not
affect the surplus account

what we should call a proper stock dividend is one that is paid to
shareholders to give them a tangible evidence or representation of
specific earnings  which  have  been  reinvested  in  the  business  for
their account over some relatively short period in the recent past
say  not  more  than  the  two  preceding  years  it  is  now  approved
practice to value such a stock dividend at the approximate value at
the  time  of  declaration  and  to  transfer  an  amount  equal  to  such
value from earned surplus to capital accounts thus the amount of
a typical stock dividend is relatively smallin most cases not more
than 5 in essence a stock dividend of this sort has the same over
all  effect  as  the  payment  of  an  equivalent  amount  of  cash  out  of
earnings when accompanied by the sale of additional shares of like
total value to the shareholders however a straight stock dividend
has  an  important  tax  advantage  over  the  otherwise  equivalent
combination  of  cash  dividends  with  stock  subscription  rights
which is the almost standard practice for publicutility companies
the  new  york  stock  exchange  has  set  the  figure  of  25  as  a
practical  dividing  line  between  stock  splits  and  stock  dividends
those of 25 or more need not be accompanied by the transfer of
their  market  value  from  earned  surplus  to  capital  and  so  forth
some  companies  especially  banks  still  follow  the  old  practice  of

 today  virtually  all  stock  splits  are  carried  out  by  a  change  in  value  in  a
twoforone  split  one  share  becomes  two  each  trading  at  half  the  former
price of the original single share in a threeforone split one share becomes
three each trading at a third of the former price and so on only in very rare
cases is a sum transferred from earned surplus to capital account as in
grahams day
 rule 703 of the new york stock exchange governs stock splits and stock
dividends the nyse now designates stock dividends of greater than 25
and less than 100 as partial stock splits unlike in grahams day these
stock  dividends  may  now  trigger  the  nyses  accounting  requirement  that
the amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained earnings

494

the intelligent investor

declaring any kind of stock dividend they pleaseeg one of 10
not  related  to  recent  earningsand  these  instances  maintain  an
undesirable confusion in the financial world

we have long been a strong advocate of a systematic and clearly
enunciated  policy  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  cash  and  stock
dividends under such a policy stock dividends are paid periodi
cally to capitalize all or a stated portion of the earnings reinvested
in  the  business  such  a  policycovering  100  of  the  reinvested
earningshas  been  followed  by  purex  government  employees
insurance and perhaps a few others

stock dividends of all types seem to be disapproved of by most
academic writers on the subject they insist that they are nothing
but  pieces  of  paper  that  they  give  the  shareholders  nothing  they
did  not  have  before  and  that  they  entail  needless  expense  and
inconvenience on our side we consider this a completely doctri
naire  view  which  fails  to  take  into  account  the  practical  and 
psychological  realities  of  investment  true  a  periodic  stock  divi
dendsay of 5changes only the form of the owners invest
ment  he  has  105  shares  in  place  of  100  but  without  the  stock
dividend the original 100 shares would have represented the same

 this  policy  already  unusual  in  grahams  day  is  extremely  rare  today  in
1936  and  again  in  1950  roughly  half  of  all  stocks  on  the  nyse  paid  a
socalled special dividend by 1970 however that percentage had declined
to less than 10 and by the 1990s was well under 5 see harry dean
gelo linda deangelo and douglas j skinner special dividends and the
evolution of dividend signaling journal of financial economics vol 57 no
3 september 2000 pp 309354 the most plausible explanation for this
decline  is  that  corporate  managers  became  uncomfortable  with  the  idea
that  shareholders  might  interpret  special  dividends  as  a  signal  that  future
profits might be low
 the academic criticism of dividends was led by merton miller and franco
modigliani whose influential article dividend policy growth and the valua
tion of shares 1961 helped win them nobel prizes in economics miller
and modigliani argued in essence that dividends were irrelevant since an
investor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and a
rising stock price or through a rising stock price alone so long as the total
return is the same in either case

495

ownership interest now embodied in his 105 shares nonetheless
the change of form is actually one of real importance and value to
him  if  he  wishes  to  cash  in  his  share  of  the  reinvested  profits  he
can do so by selling the new certificate sent him instead of having
to break up his original certificate he can count on receiving the
same  cashdividend  rate  on  105  shares  as  formerly  on  his  100
shares a 5 rise in the cashdividend rate without the stock divi
dend would not be nearly as probable

the  advantages  of  a  periodic  stockdividend  policy  are  most
evident when it is compared with the usual practice of the public
utility companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking
back  a  good  part  of  this  money  from  the  shareholders  by  selling
them additional stock through subscription rights as we men
tioned  above  the  shareholders  would  find  themselves  in  exactly
the  same  position  if  they  received  stock  dividends  in  lieu  of  the
popular  combination  of  cash  dividends  followed  by  stock  sub
scriptionsexcept that they would save the income tax otherwise
paid on the cash dividends those who need or wish the maximum
annual cash income with no additional stock can get this result by
selling their stock dividends in the same way as they sell their sub
scription rights under present practice

the aggregate amount of income tax that could be saved by sub
stituting  stock  dividends  for  the  present  stockdividendsplus
subscriptionrights  combination  is  enormous  we  urge  that  this

 grahams  argument  is  no  longer  valid  and  todays  investors  can  safely
skip over this passage shareholders no longer need to worry about having
to break up a stock certificate since virtually all shares now exist in elec
tronic rather than paper form and when graham says that a 5 increase in
a cash dividend on 100 shares is less probable than a constant dividend
on 105 shares its unclear how he could even calculate that probability
 subscription  rights  often  simply  known  as  rights  are  used  less  fre
quently than in grahams day they confer upon an existing shareholder the
right to buy new shares sometimes at a discount to market price a share
holder who does not participate will end up owning proportionately less of
the company thus as is the case with so many other things that go by the
name of rights some coercion is often involved rights are most common
today among closedend funds and insurance or other holding companies

496

the intelligent investor

change be made by the public utilities despite its adverse effect on
the  us  treasury  because  we  are  convinced  that  it  is  completely
inequitable to impose a second personal income tax on earnings
which are not really received by the shareholders since the compa
nies take the same money back through sales of stock

efficient  corporations  continuously  modernize  their  facilities
their products their bookkeeping their managementtraining pro
grams their employee relations it is high time they thought about
modernizing their major financial practices not the least important
of which is their dividend policy

 the administration of president george w bush made progress in early
2003  toward  reducing  the  problem  of  doubletaxation  of  corporate  divi
dends although it is too soon to know how helpful any final laws in this area
will turn out to be a cleaner approach would be to make dividend payments
taxdeductible to the corporation but that is not part of the proposed legis
lation

perhaps no other part of the intelligent investor was more drastically
changed by graham than this in the first edition this chapter was one
of a pair that together ran nearly 34 pages that original section the
investor  as  business  owner  dealt  with  shareholders  voting  rights
ways of judging the quality of corporate management and techniques
for  detecting  conflicts  of  interest  between  insiders  and  outside
investors by his last revised edition however graham had pared the
whole discussion back to less than eight terse pages about dividends
why did graham cut away more than threequarters of his original
argument  after  decades  of  exhortation  he  evidently  had  given  up
hope  that  investors  would  ever  take  any  interest  in  monitoring  the
behavior of corporate managers

but the latest epidemic of scandalallegations of managerial mis
behavior shady accounting or tax maneuvers at major firms like aol
enron  global  crossing  sprint  tyco  and  worldcomis  a  stark
reminder  that  grahams  earlier  warnings  about  the  need  for  eternal
vigilance are more vital than ever let us bring them back and discuss
them in light of todays events

graham begins his original 1949 discussion of the investor as busi

are king acting as a majority they can hire and fire managements and
bend them completely to their will but in practice says graham

commentary on chapter 19

the shareholders are a complete washout as a class they show nei

whatever the management recommends and no matter how poor the
managements record of accomplishment may be    the only way to
inspire the average american shareholder to take any independently
intelligent action would be by exploding a firecracker under him   
we cannot resist pointing out the paradoxical fact that jesus seems
to have been a more practical businessman than are american share

graham  wants  you  to  realize  something  basic  but  incredibly  pro
found when you buy a stock you become an owner of the company
its  managers  all  the  way  up  to  the  ceo  work  for  you  its  board  of
directors must answer to you its cash belongs to you its businesses

in at least four parables in the gospels there is reference to a highly critical
relationship  between  a  man  of  wealth  and  those  he  puts  in  charge  of  his
property most to the point are the words that a certain rich man speaks to
his  steward  or  manager  who  is  accused  of  wasting  his  goods  give  an

out that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional security ana

the  right  to  call  for  a  formal  investigation  of  managers  whose  leadership
does  not  enhance  the  value  of  the  stock  graham  adds  dryly  that  such
action is almost unheard of in practice this he says highlights the wide

management relationships

todays investors have forgotten grahams message they put most of
their effort into buying a stock a little into selling itbut none into own
ing it certainly graham reminds us there is just as much reason to
exercise care and judgment in being as in becoming a stockholder 3

so  how  should  you  as  an  intelligent  investor  go  about  being  an
intelligent owner graham starts by telling us that there are just two
basic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention

1 is the management reasonably efficient
2 are  the  interests  of  the  average  outside shareholder  receiving

proper recognition 4

you should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each
companys profitability size and competitiveness against similar firms
in its industry what if you conclude that the managers are no good
then urges graham

a few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced
that  a  change  is  needed  and  should  be  willing  to  work  toward  that
end  second  the  rank  and  file  of  the  stockholders  should  be  open
minded  enough  to  read  the  proxy  material  and  to  weigh  the  argu
ments on both sides they must at least be able to know when their
company has been unsuccessful and be ready to demand more than
artful platitudes as a vindication of the incumbent management third
it  would  be  most  helpful  when  the  figures  clearly  show  that  the
results are well below average if it became the custom to call in out
side business engineers to pass upon the policies and competence
of the management5

to  the  board  of  directors  however  the  company  would  bear  the  costs  of

back in 1999 enron corp ranked seventh on the fortune 500
list  of  americas  top  companies  the  energy  giants  revenues
assets and earnings were all rising like rockets

but what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering
numbersand  had  simply  put  enrons  1999  proxy  statement
under  the  microscope  of  common  sense  under  the  heading
certain  transactions  the  proxy  disclosed  that  enrons  chief
financial  officer  andrew  fastow  was  the  managing  member
of two partnerships ljm1 and ljm2 that bought energy and
communications  related  investments  and  where  was  ljm1
and ljm2 buying from why where else but from enron the
proxy  reported  that  the  partnerships  had  already  bought  170
million of assets from enronsometimes using money borrowed
from enron

the intelligent investor would immediately have asked

 did  enrons  directors  approve  this  arrangement  yes  said

the proxy

 would  fastow  get  a  piece  of  ljms  profits  yes  said  the

proxy

 as enrons chief financial officer was fastow obligated to act
exclusively  in  the  interests  of  enrons  shareholders  of
course

 was  fastow  therefore  dutybound  to  maximize  the  price

enron obtained for any assets it sold absolutely

 but  if  ljm  paid  a  high  price  for  enrons  assets  would  that
lower  ljms  potential  profitsand  fastows  personal
income clearly

 on the other hand if ljm paid a low price would that raise
profits  for  fastow  and  his  partnerships  but  hurt  enrons
income clearly

 should enron lend fastows partnerships any money to buy
assets  from  enron  that  might  generate  a  personal  profit  for
fastow say what

 does not  all  this  constitute  profoundly  disturbing  conflicts  of

interest no other answer is even possible

commentary on chapter 19

501

 what does this arrangement say about the judgment of the
directors  who  approved  it  it  says  you  should  take  your
investment dollars elsewhere

two  clear  lessons  emerge  from  this  disaster  never  dig  so
deep  into  the  numbers  that  you  check  your  common  sense  at
the door and always read the proxy statement before and after
you buy a stock

what is proxy material and why does graham insist that you read
it in its proxy statement which it sends to every shareholder a com
pany  announces  the  agenda  for  its  annual  meeting  and  discloses
details  about  the  compensation  and  stock  ownership  of  managers
and directors along with transactions between insiders and the com
pany shareholders are asked to vote on which accounting firm should
audit the books and who should serve on the board of directors if you
use your common sense while reading the proxy this document can
be like a canary in a coal minean early warning system signaling that
something is wrong see the enron sidebar above

yet on average between a third and a half of all individual investors

cannot be bothered to vote their proxies6 do they even read them

understanding and voting your proxy is as every bit as fundamental

contd from p 499 graham had in mind were money managers rating agen
cies  and  organizations  of  security  analysts  today  investors  could  choose
from among hundreds of consulting firms restructuring advisers and mem
bers of entities like the risk management association
6 tabulations  of  voting  results  for  2002  by  georgeson  shareholder  and
adps investor communication services two leading firms that mail proxy
solicitations to investors suggest response rates that average around 80
to 88 including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their clients
which  are  automatically  voted  in  favor  of  management  unless  the  clients
specify otherwise thus the owners of between 12 and 20 of all shares
are not voting their proxies since individuals own only 40 of us shares
by  market  value  and  most  institutional  investors  like  pension  funds  and
insurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy issues that means
that roughly a third of all individual investors are neglecting to vote

502

commentary on chapter 19

to being an intelligent investor as following the news and voting your
conscience is to being a good citizen it does not matter whether you
own  10  of  a  company  or  with  your  piddling  100  shares  just
110000  of  1  if  you have  never  read  the  proxy  of  a  stock  you  own
and  the  company  goes  bust  the  only  person  you  should  blame  is
yourself if you do read the proxy and see things that disturb you then





vote against every director to let them know you disapprove
attend the annual meeting and speak up for your rights
find an online message board devoted to the stock like those at
httpfinanceyahoocom  and  rally  other  investors  to  join  your
because

graham had another idea that could benefit todays investors

   there are advantages to be gained through the selection of one or
more professional and independent directors these should be men
of wide business experience who can turn a fresh and expert eye on
the  problems  of  the  enterprise    they  should  submit  a  separate
annual report addressed directly to the stockholders and containing
their views on the major question which concerns the owners of the
enterprise is the business showing the results for the outside stock
holder  which  could  be  expected  of  it  under  proper  management  if
not whyand what should be done about it7

one  can  only  imagine  the  consternation  that  grahams  proposal
would cause among the corporate cronies and golfing buddies who
constitute so many of todays independent directors let us not sug
gest that it might send a shudder of fear down their spines since most
independent directors do not appear to have a backbone

w h o s e   m o n e y   i s   i t    a n y w a y 

now  let us  look  at  grahams  second  criterionwhether  management
acts in the best interests of outside investors managers have always
told shareholders that theythe managersknow best what to do with

503

the  companys  cash  graham  saw  right  through  this  managerial
malarkey

a companys management may run the business well and yet not give
the  outside  stockholders  the  right  results  for  them  because  its  effi
ciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use
of the capital the objective of efficient operation is to produce at low
cost and to find the most profitable articles to sell efficient finance
requires that the stockholders money be working in forms most suit
able to their interest this is a question in which management as such
has little interest actually it almost always wants as much capital from
the owners as it can possibly get in order to minimize its own financial
problems thus the typical management will operate with more capital
than necessary if the stockholders permit itwhich they often do8

in  the  late  1990s  and  into  the  early  2000s  the  managements  of
leading technology companies took this daddyknowsbest attitude
to  new  extremes  the  argument  went  like  this  why  should  you
demand a dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn it
into  a  rising  share  price  just  look  at  the  way  our  stock  has  been
going updoesnt that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollars
better than you can

incredibly investors fell for it hook line and sinker daddy knows
best became such gospel that by 1999 only 37 of the companies
that first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividenddown
from an average of 721 of all ipos in the 1960s9 just look at how

stock  returns  but  that  dividend  increases  are  associated  with
higher future profitability for at least four years after the dividend

in short most managers are wrong when they say that they can put
your cash to better use than you can paying out a dividend does not
guarantee great results but it does improve the return of the typical
stock  by  yanking  at  least  some  cash  out  of  the  managers  hands
before they can either squander it or squirrel it away

per share will rise since its total earnings will be spread across fewer
shares that in turn should lift the stock price better yet unlike a div
idend a buyback is taxfree to investors who do not sell their shares15
thus it increases the value of their stock without raising their tax bill
and if the shares are cheap then spending spare cash to repurchase
them is an excellent use of the companys capital16

all this is true in theory unfortunately in the real world stock buy
backs have come to serve a purpose that can only be described as
sinister now that grants of stock options have become such a large
part of executive compensation many companiesespecially in high
tech  industriesmust  issue  hundreds  of  millions  of  shares  to  give  to
the managers who exercise those stock options17 but that would jack

not yet clear by press time
16 historically  companies  took  a  commonsense  approach  toward  share
repurchases  reducing  them  when  stock  prices  were  high  and  stepping
them up when prices were low after the stock market crash of october 19
1987 for example 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next
12 days alonewhile only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in
the earlier part of the year when stock prices had been much higher see

17 the stock options granted by a company to its executives and employees
give them the right but not the obligation to buy shares in the future at a
discounted price that conversion of options to shares is called exercising
the options the employees can then sell the shares at the current market
price and pocket the difference as profit because hundreds of millions of
options  may  be  exercised  in  a  given  year  the  company  must  increase  its
supply  of  shares  outstanding  then  however  the  companys  total  net
income would be spread across a much greater number of shares reducing
its earnings per share therefore the company typically feels compelled to
buy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders

up the number of shares outstanding and shrink earnings per share
to counteract that dilution the companies must turn right back around
and repurchase millions of shares in the open market by 2000 com
panies were spending an astounding 418 of their total net income
to repurchase their own sharesup from 48 in 198018

let us  look  at  oracle  corp  the  software  giant  between  june  1
1999 and may 31 2000 oracle issued 101 million shares of com
mon stock to its senior executives and another 26 million to employ
ees  at  a  cost  of  484  million  meanwhile  to  keep  the  exercise  of
earlier stock options from diluting its earnings per share oracle spent
53 billionor 52 of its total revenues that yearto buy back 2907
million shares of stock oracle issued the stock to insiders at an aver
age price of 353 per share and repurchased it at an average price of
1826 sell low buy high is this any way to enhance shareholder
value19

by  2002  oracles  stock  had  fallen  to  less  than  half  its  peak  in
2000  now  that  its  shares  were  cheaper  did  oracle  hasten  to  buy
back more stock between june 1 2001 and may 31 2002 oracle
cut its repurchases to 28 billion apparently because its executives
and employees exercised fewer options that year the same selllow
buyhigh pattern is evident at dozens of other technology companies

what is going on here two surprising factors are at work

18 one of the main factors driving this change was the us securities and
exchange commissions decision in 1982 to relax its previous restrictions
on share repurchases see gustavo grullon and roni michaely dividends
share  repurchases  and  the  substitution  hypothesis  the  journal  of
finance vol 57 no 4 august 2002 pp 16491684
19 throughout  his  writings  graham  insists  that  corporate  managements
have a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued but also to
make sure it never gets overvalued as he put it in security analysis 1934
ed p 515 the responsibility of managements to act in the interest of their
shareholders includes the obligation to preventin so far as they are able
the establishment of either absurdly high or unduly low prices for their secu
rities  thus  enhancing  shareholder  value  does not  just  mean  making  sure
that  the  stock  price  does  not  go  too  low  it  also  means  ensuring  that  the
stock price does not go up to unjustifiable levels if only the executives of
internet companies had heeded grahams wisdom back in 1999

companies get a tax break when executives and employees exer

expense to the company20 in its fiscal years from 2000 through

a senior executive heavily compensated with stock options has a
vested interest in favoring stock buybacks over dividends why
for technical reasons options increase in value as the price fluc
tuations of a stock grow more extreme but dividends dampen the
volatility of a stocks price so if the managers increased the divi
dend they would lower the value of their own stock options21

no wonder ceos would much rather buy back stock than pay divi
dendsregardless of how overvalued the shares may be or how dras
tically that may waste the resources of the outside shareholders

finally drowsy investors have given their companies free rein to over
pay executives in ways that are simply unconscionable in 1997 steve
jobs the cofounder of apple computer inc returned to the company
as  its  interim  chief  executive  officer  already  a  wealthy  man  jobs
insisted on taking a cash salary of 1 per year at yearend 1999 to
thank jobs for serving as ceo for the previous 2 12 years without
compensation the board presented him with his very own gulfstream
jet at a cost to the company of a mere 90 million the next month
jobs  agreed  to  drop  interim  from  his  job  title  and  the  board
rewarded him with options on 20 million shares until then jobs had
held a grand total of two shares of apple stock

the principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of
managers  with  outside  investors  if  you  are  an  outside  apple  share
holder  you  want  its  managers  to  be  rewarded  only  if  apples  stock
earns superior returns nothing else could possibly be fair to you and
the other owners of the company but as john bogle former chairman
of the vanguard funds points out nearly all managers sell the stock
they  receive  immediately  after  exercising  their  options  how  could
dumping  millions  of  shares  for  an  instant  profit  possibly  align  their
interests with those of the companys loyal longterm shareholders

in jobs case if apple stock rises by just 5 annually through the
beginning of 2010 he will be able to cash in his options for 5483
million in other words even if apples stock earns no better than half
the longterm average return of the overall stock market jobs will land
a halfabillion dollar windfall22 does that align his interests with those
of apples shareholdersor malign the trust that apples shareholders
have placed in the board of directors

reading proxy statements vigilantly the intelligent owner will vote
against  any  executive  compensation  plan  that  uses  option  grants  to
turn more than 3 of the companys shares outstanding over to the
managers and you should veto any plan that does not make option
grants contingent on a fair and enduring measure of superior results

margin of safety as the 

central concept of investment

in the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of
mortal  affairs  into  the  single  phrase  this  too  will  pass  con
fronted  with  a  like  challenge  to  distill  the  secret  of  sound  invest
ment  into  three  words  we  venture  the  motto  margin  of
safety this is the thread that runs through all the preceding dis
cussion of investment policyoften explicitly sometimes in a less
direct  fashion  let  us  try  now  briefly  to  trace  that  idea  in  a  con
nected argument

all  experienced  investors  recognize  that  the  marginofsafety
concept  is  essential  to  the  choice  of  sound  bonds  and  preferred
stocks  for  example  a  railroad  should  have  earned  its  total  fixed
charges better than five times before income tax taking a period
of years for its bonds to qualify as investmentgrade issues this
past ability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the
margin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against
loss  or  discomfiture  in  the  event  of  some  future decline  in  net
income the margin above charges may be stated in other ways

 it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a
sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all
times  and  situations  they  presented  him  the  words  and  this  too  shall
pass away how much it expresses how chastening in the hour of pride
how consoling in the depths of affliction and this too shall pass away and
yet let us hope it is not quite trueabraham lincoln address to the wis

margin of safety as the central concept of investment

513

for  example  in  the  percentage  by  which  revenues  or  profits  may
decline before the balance after interest disappearsbut the under
lying idea remains the same

the  bond  investor  does  not  expect  future  average  earnings  to
work out the same as in the past if he were sure of that the margin
demanded  might  be  small  nor  does  he  rely  to  any  controlling
extent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate
rially better or poorer than in the past if he did that he would have
to  measure  his  margin  in  terms  of  a  carefully  projected income
account  instead  of  emphasizing  the  margin  shown  in  the  past
record here the function of the margin of safety is in essence that
of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future if the
margin is a large one then it is enough to assume that future earn
ings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor
to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time

the margin of safety for bonds may be calculated alternatively
by comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of
debt  a similar  calculation  may  be  made  for  a  preferredstock
issue if the business owes 10 million and is fairly worth 30 mil
lion there is room for a shrinkage of twothirds in valueat least
theoreticallybefore the bondholders will suffer loss the amount
of this extra value or cushion above the debt may be approxi
mated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues
over  a  period  of  years  since  average  stock  prices  are  generally
related to average earning power the margin of enterprise value
over  debt  and  the  margin  of  earnings  over  charges  will  in  most
cases yield similar results

so much for the marginofsafety concept as applied to fixed
value investments can it be carried over into the field of common
stocks yes but with some necessary modifications

there are instances where a common stock may be considered
sound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good
bond this will occur for example when a company has outstand
ing only common stock that under depression conditions is selling
for  less  than  the  amount  of  bonds  that  could  safely  be  issued
against its property and earning power that was the position of a

 earning power is grahams term for a companys potential profits or as
he puts it the amount that a firm might be expected to earn year after year

the intelligent investor

host of strongly financed industrial companies at the low price lev
els of 193233 in such instances the investor can obtain the margin
of  safety  associated  with  a  bond  plus all  the  chances  of  larger
income  and  principal  appreciation  inherent  in  a  common  stock
the  only  thing  he  lacks  is  the  legal  power  to  insist  on  dividend
payments  or  elsebut  this  is  a  small  drawback  as  compared
with his advantages common stocks bought under such circum
stances  will  supply  an  ideal  though  infrequent  combination  of
safety and profit opportunity as a quite recent example of this con
dition let us mention once more national presto industries stock
which sold for a total enterprise value of 43 million in 1972 with
its 16 millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could
easily have supported this amount of bonds

in  the  ordinary  common  stock  bought  for  investment  under
normal conditions the margin of safety lies in an expected earning
power considerably above the going rate for bonds in former edi
tions we elucidated this point with the following figures

assume  in  a  typical  case  that  the  earning  power  is  9  on  the
price and that the bond rate is 4 then the stockbuyer will have
an average annual margin of 5 accruing in his favor some of the
excess is paid to him in the dividend rate even though spent by
him it enters into his overall investment result the undistributed
balance is reinvested in the business for his account in many cases
such reinvested earnings fail to add commensurately to the earn
ing  power  and  value  of  his  stock  that  is  why  the  market  has  a
stubborn  habit  of  valuing  earnings  disbursed  in  dividends  more
generously than the portion retained in the business but if the
picture is viewed as a whole there is a reasonably close connection

if  the  business  conditions  prevailing  during  the  period  were  to  continue
unchanged  security  analysis 1934  ed  p  354  some  of  his  lectures
make it clear that graham intended the term to cover periods of five years or
more  you  can  crudely  but  conveniently  approximate  a  companys  earning
power per share by taking the inverse of its priceearnings ratio a stock with
a pe ratio of 11 can be said to have earning power of 9 or 1 divided by
11 today earning power is often called earnings yield
 this problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on chapter 19

between  the  growth  of  corporate  surpluses  through  reinvested
earnings and the growth of corporate values

over  a  tenyear  period  the  typical  excess  of  stock  earning
power  over  bond  interest  may  aggregate  50  of  the  price  paid
this figure is sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety
which  under  favorable  conditions  will  prevent  or  minimize  a
loss  if  such  a  margin  is  present  in  each  of  a  diversified  list  of
twenty or more stocks the probability of a favorable result under
fairly  normal  conditions  becomes  very  large  that  is  why  the
policy  of  investing  in  representative  common  stocks  does  not
require high qualities of insight and foresight to work out success
fully if the purchases are made at the average level of the market
over a span of years the prices paid should carry with them assur
ance of an adequate margin of safety the danger to investors lies
in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market
or  in  buying  nonrepresentative  common  stocks  that  carry  more
than average risk of diminished earning power

as  we  see  it  the  whole  problem  of  commonstock  investment
under  1972  conditions  lies  in  the  fact  that  in  a  typical  case  the
earning power is now much less than 9 on the price paid let us
assume  that  by  concentrating  somewhat  on  the  lowmultiplier
issues  among  the  large  companies  a  defensive  investor  may  now

 graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a lecture he
gave in 1972 the margin of safety is the difference between the percent
age rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate
of interest on bonds and that margin of safety is the difference which would
absorb  unsatisfactory  developments  at  the  time  the  1965  edition  of  the
intelligent  investor was  written  the  typical  stock  was  selling  at  11  times
earnings giving about 9 return as against 4 on bonds in that case you
had a margin of safety of over 100 per cent now in 1972 there is no dif
ference between the earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks
and  i  say  there  is  no  margin  of  safety    you  have  a  negative  margin  of
safety on stocks    see benjamin graham thoughts on security analy

the intelligent investor

acquire equities at 12 times recent earningsie with an earnings
return of 833 on cost he may obtain a dividend yield of about
4 and he will have 433 of his cost reinvested in the business for
his account on this basis the excess of stock earning power over
bond interest over a tenyear basis would still be too small to con
stitute  an  adequate  margin  of  safety  for  that  reason  we  feel  that
there are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound common
stocks  the  risks  may  be  fully  offset  by  the  profit  possibilities  of 
the list and indeed the investor may have no choice but to incur
themfor  otherwise  he  may  run  an  even  greater  risk  of  holding
only  fixed  claims  payable  in  steadily  depreciating  dollars  none
theless  the  investor  would  do  well  to  recognize  and  to  accept 
as  philosophically  as  he  can  that  the  old  package  of  good  profit 
possibilities  combined  with  small  ultimate  risk is  no  longer  available 
to him

however  the  risk  of  paying  too  high  a  price  for  goodquality
stockswhile  a  real  oneis  not  the  chief  hazard  confronting  the
average  buyer  of  securities  observation  over  many  years  has
taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase
of lowquality securities  at  times  of  favorable  business  conditions
the  purchasers  view  the  current  good  earnings  as  equivalent  to
earning power and assume that prosperity is synonymous with
safety it is in those years that bonds and preferred stocks of infe
rior grade can be sold to the public at a price around par because
they carry a little higher income return or a deceptively attractive
conversion  privilege  it  is  then  also  that  common  stocks  of
obscure companies can be floated at prices far above the tangible
investment  on  the  strength  of  two  or  three  years  of  excellent
growth

these securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any
admissible sense of the term coverage of interest charges and pre
ferred dividends must be tested over a number of years including
preferably a period of subnormal business such as in 197071 the
same  is  ordinarily  true  of  commonstock  earnings  if  they  are  to

qualify as indicators of earning power thus it follows that most of
the  fairweather  investments  acquired  at  fairweather  prices  are
destined  to  suffer  disturbing  price  declines  when  the  horizon
clouds  overand  often  sooner  than  that  nor  can  the  investor
count  with  confidence  on  an  eventual  recoveryalthough  this
does come about in some proportion of the casesfor he has never
had a real safety margin to tide him through adversity

the philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part
and  in  part  contravenes  the  marginofsafety  principle  the
growthstock  buyer  relies  on  an  expected  earning  power  that  is
greater than the average shown in the past thus he may be said to
substitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating
his margin of safety in investment theory there is no reason why
carefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guide
than the bare record of the past in fact security analysis is coming
more and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of the
future thus the growthstock approach may supply as dependable
a  margin  of  safety  as  is  found  in  the  ordinary  investment
provided the calculation of the future is conservatively made and
provided  it  shows  a  satisfactory  margin  in  relation  to  the  price
paid

the  danger  in  a  growthstock  program  lies  precisely  here  for
such  favored  issues  the  market  has  a  tendency  to  set  prices  that
will  not  be  adequately  protected  by  a  conservative projection  of
future  earnings  it  is  a  basic  rule  of  prudent  investment  that  all
estimates  when  they  differ  from  past  performance  must  err  at
least slightly on the side of understatement the margin of safety
is always dependent on the price paid it will be large at one price
small at some higher price nonexistent at some still higher price if
as  we  suggest  the  average  market  level  of  most  growth  stocks  is
too  high  to  provide  an  adequate  margin  of  safety  for  the  buyer
then a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not
work out satisfactorily a special degree of foresight and judgment
will be needed in order that wise individual selections may over
come  the  hazards  inherent  in  the  customary  market  level  of  such
issues as a whole

the  marginofsafety  idea  becomes  much  more  evident  when
we  apply  it  to  the  field  of  undervalued  or  bargain  securities  we
have  here  by  definition  a  favorable  difference  between  price  on

518

the intelligent investor

the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other that
difference  is  the  safety  margin  it  is  available  for  absorbing  the
effect of miscalculations or worse than average luck the buyer of
bargain  issues  places  particular  emphasis  on  the  ability  of  the
investment to withstand adverse developments for in most such
cases  he  has  no  real  enthusiasm  about  the  companys  prospects
true if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to
avoid  the  security  no  matter  how  low  the  price  but  the  field  of
undervalued issues is drawn from the many concernsperhaps a
majority  of  the  totalfor  which  the  future  appears  neither  dis
tinctly  promising  nor  distinctly  unpromising  if  these  are  bought
on a bargain basis even a moderate decline in the earning power
need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results
the margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose

theory of diversification

there  is  a  close  logical  connection  between  the  concept  of  a
safety  margin  and  the  principle  of  diversification  one  is  correla
tive with the other even with a margin in the investors favor an
individual security may work out badly for the margin guarantees
only  that  he  has  a  better  chance  for  profit  than  for  lossnot  that
loss  is  impossible  but  as  the  number  of  such  commitments  is
increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the
profits  will  exceed  the  aggregate  of  the  losses  that  is  the  simple
basis of the insuranceunderwriting business

diversification  is  an  established  tenet  of  conservative  invest
ment  by  accepting  it  so  universally  investors  are  really  demon
strating their acceptance of the marginofsafety principle to which
diversification is the companion this point may be made more col
orful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette if a man bets 1 on
a  single  number  he  is  paid  35  profit  when  he  winsbut  the
chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose he has a negative margin of
safety in his case diversification is foolish the more numbers he
bets on the smaller his chance of ending with a profit if he regu
larly bets 1 on every number including 0 and 00 he is certain to
lose 2 on each turn of the wheel but suppose the winner received
39 profit instead of 35 then he would have a small but impor
tant margin of safety therefore the more numbers he wagers on

margin of safety as the central concept of investment

519

the better his chance of gain and he could be certain of winning 2
on every spin by simply betting 1 each on all the numbers inci
dentally  the  two  examples  given  actually  describe  the  respective
positions of the player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00

a criterion of investment versus speculation

since  there  is  no  single  definition  of  investment  in  general
acceptance  authorities  have  the  right  to  define  it  pretty  much  as
they please many of them deny that there is any useful or depend
able difference between the concepts of investment and of specula
tion  we  think  this  skepticism  is  unnecessary  and  harmful  it  is
injurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of
many  people  toward  the  excitement  and  hazards  of  stockmarket
speculation we suggest that the marginofsafety concept may be
used to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment
operation from a speculative one

probably  most  speculators  believe  they  have  the  odds  in  their
favor  when  they  take  their  chances  and  therefore  they  may  lay
claim to a safety margin in their proceedings each one has the feel
ing that the time is propitious for his purchase or that his skill is
superior to the crowds or that his adviser or system is trustwor
thy  but  such  claims  are  unconvincing  they  rest  on  subjective
judgment unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any

 in american roulette most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers
1 through 36 for a total of 38 slots the casino offers a maximum payout 
of 35 to 1 what if you bet 1 on every number since only one slot can 
be the one into which the ball drops you would win 35 on that slot but
lose 1 on each of your other 37 slots for a net loss of 2 that 2 differ
ence  or  a  526  spread  on  your  total  38  bet  is  the  casinos  house
advantage ensuring that on average roulette players will always lose more
than they win just as it is in the roulette players interest to bet as seldom as
possible  it  is  in  the  casinos  interest  to  keep  the  roulette  wheel  spinning
likewise  the  intelligent  investor  should  seek  to  maximize  the  number  of
holdings  that  offer  a  better  chance  for  profit  than  for  loss  for  most
investors  diversification  is  the  simplest  and  cheapest  way  to  widen  your
margin of safety

520

the intelligent investor

conclusive  line  of  reasoning  we  greatly  doubt  whether  the  man
who  stakes  money  on  his  view  that  the  market  is  heading  up  or
down can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any
useful sense of the phrase

by  contrast  the  investors  concept  of  the  margin  of  safetyas
developed  earlier  in  this  chapterrests  upon  simple  and  definite
arithmetical reasoning from statistical data we believe also that it
is well supported by practical investment experience there is no
guarantee  that  this  fundamental  quantitative  approach  will  con
tinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions of
the future but equally there is no valid reason for pessimism on
this score

thus in sum we say that to have a true investment there must
be present a true margin of safety and a true margin of safety is
one that can be demonstrated by figures by persuasive reasoning
and by reference to a body of actual experience

extension of the concept of investment

to complete our discussion of the marginofsafety principle we
must  now  make  a  further  distinction  between  conventional  and
unconventional investments conventional investments are appro
priate  for  the  typical  portfolio  under  this  heading  have  always
come united states government issues and highgrade dividend
paying common stocks we have added state and municipal bonds
for those who will benefit sufficiently by their taxexempt features
also included are firstquality corporate bonds when as now they
can be bought to yield sufficiently more than united states savings
bonds

unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for
the  enterprising  investor  they  cover  a  wide  range  the  broadest
category is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com
panies  which  we  recommend  for  purchase  when  they  can  be
bought at twothirds or less of their indicated value besides these
there is often a wide choice of mediumgrade corporate bonds and
preferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as
to be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent
value in these cases the average investor would be inclined to call
the securities speculative because in his mind their lack of a first
quality rating is synonymous with a lack of investment merit

margin of safety as the central concept of investment

521

it is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a secu
rity  of  mediocre  quality  into  a  sound  investment  opportunity
provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he
practices adequate diversification for if the price is low enough to
create a substantial margin of safety the security thereby meets our
criterion  of  investment  our  favorite  supporting  illustration  is
taken  from  the  field  of  realestate  bonds  in  the  1920s  billions  of
dollars worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom
mended  as  sound  investments  a large  proportion  had  so  little
margin  of  value  over  debt  as  to  be  in  fact  highly  speculative  in
character in the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of
these bonds defaulted their interest and their price collapsedin
some  cases  below  10  cents  on  the  dollar  at  that  stage  the  same
advisers  who  had  recommended  them  at  par  as  safe  investments
were rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac
tive type but as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90
made  many  of  these  securities  exceedingly  attractive  and  reason
ably safefor the true values behind them were four or five times
the market quotation

the  fact  that  the  purchase  of  these  bonds  actually  resulted  in
what is generally called a large speculative profit did not prevent
them from having true investment qualities at their low prices the
speculative profit was the purchasers reward for having made
an  unusually  shrewd  investment  they  could  properly  be  called
investment opportunities  since  a  careful  analysis  would  have
shown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin
of safety thus the very class of fairweather investments which
we stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naive security
buyers  is  likely  to  afford  many  sound  profit  opportunities  to  the
sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his
own price

 graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock there
are  only  cheap  stocks  and  expensive  stocks  even  the  best  company
becomes a sell when its stock price goes too high while the worst com
pany is worth buying if its stock goes low enough
 the  very  people  who  considered  technology  and  telecommunications
stocks a sure thing in late 1999 and early 2000 when they were hellishly
overpriced shunned them as too risky in 2002even contd on p 522

522

the intelligent investor

the  whole  field  of  special  situations  would  come  under  our
definition  of  investment  operations  because  the  purchase  is
always  predicated  on  a  thoroughgoing  analysis  that  promises  a
larger realization than the price paid again there are risk factors in
each individual case but these are allowed for in the calculations
and absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation

to carry this discussion to a logical extreme we might suggest
that a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying
such intangible values as are represented by a group of common
stock  option  warrants  selling  at  historically  low  prices  this
example is intended as somewhat of a shocker the entire value
of  these  warrants  rests  on  the  possibility  that  the  related  stocks
may  some  day  advance  above  the  option  price  at  the  moment
they  have  no  exercisable  value  yet  since  all  investment  rests  on
reasonable future expectations it is proper to view these warrants
in terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull market
will  create  a  large  increase  in  their  indicated  value  and  in  their
price  such  a  study  might  well  yield  the  conclusion  that  there  is
much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and
that the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of
an ultimate loss if that is so there is a safety margin present even

contd  from  p  521 though  in  grahams  exact  words  from  an  earlier
period the price depreciation of about 90 made many of these securities
exceedingly attractive and reasonably safe similarly wall streets analysts
have always tended to call a stock a strong buy when its price is high and
to label it a sell after its price has fallenthe exact opposite of what gra
ham and simple common sense would dictate as he does throughout the
book  graham  is  distinguishing  speculationor  buying  on  the  hope  that  a
stocks price will keep going upfrom investing or buying on the basis of
what the underlying business is worth
 graham uses commonstock option warrant as a synonym for warrant
a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder a right to pur
chase the companys stock at a predetermined price warrants have been
almost entirely superseded by stock options graham quips that he intends
the  example  as  a  shocker  because  even  in  his  day  warrants  were
regarded as one of the markets seediest backwaters see the commentary
on chapter 16

margin of safety as the central concept of investment

523

in  this  unprepossessing  security  form  a sufficiently  enterprising
investor  could  then  include  an  optionwarrant  operation  in  his
miscellany of unconventional investments1

to sum up

investment  is  most  intelligent  when  it  is  most businesslike it  is
amazing  to  see  how  many  capable  businessmen  try  to  operate  in
wall  street  with  complete  disregard  of  all  the  sound  principles
through  which  they  have  gained  success  in  their  own  undertak
ings yet every corporate security may best be viewed in the first
instance as an ownership interest in or a claim against a specific
business enterprise and if a person sets out to make profits from
security  purchases  and  sales  he  is  embarking  on  a  business  ven
ture  of  his  own  which  must  be  run  in  accordance  with  accepted
business principles if it is to have a chance of success

the  first  and  most  obvious  of  these  principles  is  know  what
you are doingknow your business for the investor this means
do  not  try  to  make  business  profits  out  of  securitiesthat  is
returns in excess of normal interest and dividend incomeunless
you  know  as  much  about  security  values  as  you  would  need  to
know about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu
facture or deal in

a second  business  principle  do  not  let  anyone  else  run  your
business  unless  1  you  can  supervise  his  performance  with  ade
quate care and comprehension or 2 you have unusually strong rea
sons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability for
the investor this rule should determine the conditions under which
he will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money
a third  business  principle  do  not  enter  upon  an  operation
that is manufacturing or trading in an itemunless a reliable cal
culation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit
in particular keep away from ventures in which you have little to
gain  and  much  to  lose  for  the  enterprising  investor  this  means
that his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but
on arithmetic for every investor it means that when he limits his
return  to  a  small  figureas  formerly  at  least  in  a  conventional
bond  or  preferred  stockhe  must  demand  convincing  evidence
that he is not risking a substantial part of his principal

524

the intelligent investor

a fourth  business  rule  is  more  positive  have  the  courage  of
your knowledge and experience if you have formed a conclusion
from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound act on it
even though others may hesitate or differ you are neither right
nor  wrong  because  the  crowd  disagrees  with  you  you  are  right
because your data and reasoning are right similarly in the world
of  securities  courage  becomes  the  supreme  virtue  after adequate
knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand

fortunately for the typical investor it is by no means necessary
for  his  success  that  he  bring  these  qualities  to  bear  upon  his  pro
gramprovided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines
his activities within the safe and narrow path of standard defen
sive investment to achieve satisfactory investment results is easier
than most people realize to achieve superior results is harder than it
looks

what is risk

you will  get  different  answers  depending  on  whom  and  when  you
ask  in  1999  risk  did not  mean  losing  money  it  meant  making  less
money  than  someone  else  what  many  people  feared  was  bumping
into  somebody  at  a  barbecue  who  was  getting  even  richer  even
quicker  by  day  trading  dotcom  stocks  than  they  were  then  quite
suddenly by 2003 risk had come to mean that the stock market might
keep dropping until it wiped out whatever traces of wealth you still had
left

while its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the
financial markets themselves risk has some profound and permanent
attributes  the  people  who  take  the  biggest  gambles  and  make  the
biggest gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt
the  worst  in  the  bear  market  that  inevitably  follows  being  right
makes speculators even more eager to take extra risk as their confi
dence catches fire and once you lose big money you then have to
gamble even harder just to get back to where you were like a race
track or casino gambler who desperately doubles up after every bad
bet  unless  you  are  phenomenally  lucky  that is  a  recipe  for  disaster
no wonder when he was asked to sum up everything he had learned
in his long career about how to get rich the legendary financier j k

imagine that you find a stock that you think can grow at 10 a year even if
the market only grows 5 annually unfortunately you are so enthusiastic
that you pay too high a price and the stock loses 50 of its value the first
year  even  if  the  stock  then  generates  double  the  markets  return  it  will
take you more than 16 years to overtake the marketsimply because you

bolically in place some of lakshmis devotees will lash her statue down
with strips of fabric or nail its feet to the floor for the intelligent investor
grahams margin of safety performs the same function by refusing to
pay  too  much  for  an  investment  you  minimize  the  chances  that  your
wealth will ever disappear or suddenly be destroyed

consider  this  over  the  four  quarters  ending  in  december  1999
jds uniphase corp the fiberoptics company generated 673 mil
lion  in  net  sales  on  which  it  lost  313  million  its  tangible  assets
totaled 15 billion yet on march 7 2000 jds uniphases stock hit
153  a  share  giving  the  company  a  total  market  value  of  roughly

risk  exists  in  another  dimension  inside  you  if  you  overestimate 
how well you really understand an investment or overstate your ability
to  ride  out  a  temporary  plunge  in  prices  it  does not  matter  what  you
own  or  how  the  market  does  ultimately  financial  risk  resides  not  in
what kinds of investments you have but in what kind of investor you
are if you want to know what risk really is go to the nearest bathroom
and  step  up  to  the  mirror  that is risk  gazing  back  at  you  from  the
glass

as  you  look  at  yourself  in  the  mirror  what  should  you  watch  for

factors that characterize good decisions

well as i think i do
correctlyanticipated  regret how  will  i  react  if  my  analysis
turns out to be wrong

to find out whether your confidence is wellcalibrated look in the
mirror  and  ask  yourself  what  is  the  likelihood  that  my  analysis  is
right think carefully through these questions



how  much  experience  do  i  have  what  is  my  track  record  with
similar decisions in the past

 what  is  the  typical  track  record  of  other  people  who  have  tried

have i calculated how much this investment needs to go up for
me to break even after my taxes and costs of trading

next look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of per
son who correctly anticipates your regret start by asking do i fully
understand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong
answer that question by considering these points





if  i am  right  i  could  make  a  lot  of  money  but  what  if  i am  wrong
based on the historical performance of similar investments how
much could i lose
do i have other investments that will tide me over if this decision
turns out to be wrong do i already hold stocks bonds or funds
with a proven record of going up when the kind of investment i am
considering goes down am i putting too much of my capital at
risk with this new investment

 when i tell myself you have a high tolerance for risk how do i
know have i ever lost a lot of money on an investment how did
it feel did i buy more or did i bail out
am i relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking
at  the  wrong  time  or  have  i  controlled  my  own  behavior  in
advance by diversifying signing an investment contract and dol
larcost averaging



you should always remember in the words of the psychologist paul
slovic  that  risk  is  brewed  from  an  equal  dose  of  two  ingredients
probabilities and consequences 4 before you invest you must ensure
that you have realistically assessed your probability of being right and
how you will react to the consequences of being wrong

experiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not god
exists the ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct
in this life the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in the
afterlife  in  this  wager  pascal  asserts  reason  cannot  decide  the
probability of gods existence either god exists or he does notand
only faith not reason can answer that question but while the proba
bilities  in  pascals  wager  are  a  tossup  the  consequences  are  per
fectly clear and utterly certain as bernstein explains

suppose you act as though god is and  you lead a life of virtue and
abstinence  when  in  fact  there  is  no  god  you  will  have  passed  up
some goodies in life but there will be rewards as well now suppose
you act as though god is not and spend a life of sin selfishness and
lust when in fact god is you may have had fun and thrills during the
relatively brief duration of your lifetime but when the day of judgment
rolls around you are in big trouble5

concludes  bernstein  in  making  decisions  under  conditions  of
uncertainty  the  consequences  must  dominate  the  probabilities  we
never  know  the  future  thus  as  graham  has  reminded  you  in  every
chapter of this book the intelligent investor must focus not just on get

some  of  the  time  the  probability  of  making  at  least  one  mistake  at
some point in your investing lifetime is virtually 100 and those odds
are entirely out of your control however you do have control over the
consequences of being wrong many investors put essentially all of
their money into dotcom stocks in 1999 an online survey of 1338

postscript

we know very well two partners who spent a good part of their
lives handling their own and other peoples funds on wall street
some hard experience taught them it was better to be safe and care
ful  rather  than  to  try  to  make  all  the  money  in  the  world  they
established a rather unique approach to security operations which
combined  good  profit  possibilities  with  sound  values  they
avoided  anything  that  appeared  overpriced  and  were  rather  too
quick to dispose of issues that had advanced to levels they deemed
no  longer  attractive  their  portfolio  was  always  well  diversified
with more than a hundred different issues represented in this way
they did quite well through many years of ups and downs in the
general  market  they  averaged  about  20  per  annum  on  the  sev
eral  millions  of  capital  they  had  accepted  for  management  and
their clients were well pleased with the results

in  the  year  in  which  the  first  edition  of  this  book  appeared  an
opportunity was offered to the partners fund to purchase a half
interest in a growing enterprise for some reason the industry did
not have wall street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned
down by quite a few important houses but the pair was impressed
by the companys possibilities what was decisive for them was that
the  price  was  moderate  in  relation  to  current  earnings  and  asset
value the partners went ahead with the acquisition amounting in
dollars to about onefifth of their fund they became closely identi
fied with the new business interest which prospered

 the  two  partners  graham  coyly  refers  to  are  jerome  newman  and  ben
jamin graham himself
 graham  is  describing  the  government  employees  insurance  co  or
geico in which he and newman purchased a 50 interest in 1948 right

in fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two
hundred  times  or  more  the  price  paid  for  the  halfinterest  the
advance  far  outstripped  the  actual  growth  in  profits  and  almost
from  the  start  the  quotation  appeared  much  too  high  in  terms  of
the  partners  own  investment  standards  but  since  they  regarded
the  company  as  a  sort  of  family  business  they  continued  to
maintain a substantial ownership of the shares despite the spectac
ular price rise a large number of participants in their funds did the
same  and  they  became  millionaires  through  their  holding  in  this
one enterprise plus laterorganized affiliates

ironically  enough  the  aggregate  of  profits  accruing  from  this
single  investment  decision  far  exceeded  the  sum  of  all  the  others

successful  investing  is  about  managing  risk  not  avoiding  it  at  first

glance when you realize that graham put 25 of his fund into a sin
gle stock you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors
money  but  then  when  you  discover  that  graham  had  painstakingly
established that he could liquidate geico for at least what he paid
for it it becomes clear that graham was taking very little financial risk
but  he  needed  enormous  courage  to  take  the  psychological  risk  of
such a big bet on so unknown a stock1

rate  fraud  the  specters  of  terrorism  and  war  investors  do not  like
uncertainty a market strategist is intoning right now on financial tv or
in todays newspaper but investors have never liked uncertaintyand
yet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing
world it always has been and it always will be at heart uncertainty
and investing are synonyms in the real world no one has ever been
given the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buy
stocks without a saving faith in the future no one would ever invest at
all to be an investor you must be a believer in a better tomorrow

1 grahams anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who are
not as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against the risk of
putting  too  much  money  into  a  single  investment  when  graham  himself
admits that geico was a lucky break that is a signal that most of us can
not count on being able to find such a great opportunity to keep investing
from decaying into gambling you must diversify

commentary on postscript

o brothers i said who after a hundred thousand
perils have reached the west
in this little waking vigil
that still remains to our senses
let us not choose to avoid the experience
of the unpeopled world that lies behind the sun
consider the seeds from which you sprang
you were made not to live like beasts
but to seek virtue and understanding
with this little oration i made my shipmates
so eager for the voyage
that it would have hurt to hold them back
and we swung our stern toward the morning
and turned our oars into wings for the wild flight2

investing  too  is  an  adventure  the  financial  future  is  always  an
uncharted world with graham as your guide your lifelong investing
voyage should be as safe and confident as it is adventurous

1 the superinvestors of grahamanddoddsville

by warren e buffett

editors note this  article  is  an  edited  transcript  of  a  talk  given  at
columbia university in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of
security analysis  written  by  benjamin  graham  and  david  l  dodd
this  specialized  volume  first  introduced  the  ideas  later  popularized  in
the intelligent investor buffetts essay offers a fascinating study of how
grahams disciples have used grahams value investing approach to real
ize phenomenal success in the stock market

is  the  graham  and  dodd  look  for  values  with  a  significant
margin  of  safety  relative  to  prices  approach  to  security  analysis
out of date many of the professors who write textbooks today say
yes they argue that the stock market is efficient that is that stock
prices  reflect  everything  that  is  known  about  a  companys
prospects and about the state of the economy there are no under
valued stocks these theorists argue because there are smart secu
rity  analysts  who  utilize  all  available  information  to  ensure
unfailingly appropriate prices investors who seem to beat the mar
ket  year  after  year  are  just  lucky  if  prices  fully  reflect  available
information this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out writes
one of todays textbook authors

well maybe but i want to present to you a group of investors
who have year in and year out beaten the standard  poors 500
stock index the hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at

least worth examining crucial to this examination is the fact that
these  winners  were  all  well  known  to  me  and  preidentified  as
superior investors the most recent identification occurring over fif
teen years ago absent this conditionthat is if i had just recently
searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you
this  morningi  would  advise  you  to  stop  reading  right  here  i
should add that all these records have been audited and i should
further add that i have known many of those who have invested
with these managers and the checks received by those participants
over the years have matched the stated records

before we begin this examination i would like you to imagine a
national  coinflipping  contest  let us  assume  we  get  225  million
americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a
dollar they go out in the morning at sunrise and they all call the
flip of a coin if they call correctly they win a dollar from those who
called wrong each day the losers drop out and on the subsequent
day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line
after  ten  flips  on  ten  mornings  there  will  be  approximately
220000 people in the united states who have correctly called ten
flips in a row they each will have won a little over 1000

now  this  group  will  probably  start  getting  a  little  puffed  up
about this human nature being what it is they may try to be mod
est but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive
members  of  the  opposite  sex  what  their  technique  is  and  what
marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping

assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards
from the losers in another ten days we will have 215 people who
have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who
by  this  exercise  each  have  turned  one  dollar  into  a  little  over 
1 million 225 million would have been lost 225 million would
have been won

by then this group will really lose their heads they will proba
bly  write  books  on  how  i  turned  a  dollar  into  a  million  in
twenty  days  working  thirty  seconds  a  morning  worse  yet
they will  probably  start  jetting  around  the  country  attending  semi
nars  on  efficient  coinflipping  and  tackling  skeptical  professors
with if it cannot be done why are there 215 of us

but  then  some  business  school  professor  will  probably  be 
rude  enough  to  bring  up  the  fact  that  if  225  million  orangutans 

appendixes

539

had  engaged  in  a  similar  exercise  the  results  would  be  much 
the  same215  egotistical  orangutans  with  20  straight  winning
flips

i  would  argue  however  that  there  are some  important  differ
ences  in  the  examples  i  am  going  to  present  for  one  thing  if  a
you  had  taken  225  million  orangutans  distributed  roughly  as  the
us population is if b 215 winners were left after 20 days and if
c  you  found  that  40  came  from  a  particular  zoo  in  omaha  you
would  be  pretty  sure  you  were  on  to  something  so  you  would
probably  go  out  and  ask  the  zookeeper  about  what  hes  feeding
them  whether  they  had  special  exercises  what  books  they  read
and who knows what else that is if you found any really extraor
dinary  concentrations  of  success  you  might  want  to  see  if  you
could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might
be causal factors

scientific  inquiry  naturally  follows  such  a  pattern  if  you  were
trying  to  analyze  possible  causes  of  a  rare  type  of  cancerwith
say 1500 cases a year in the united statesand you found that 400
of  them  occurred  in  some  little  mining  town  in  montana  you
would get very interested in the water there or the occupation of
those  afflicted  or  other  variables you  know  that  its  not  random
chance that 400 come from a small area you would not necessarily
know the causal factors but you would know where to search

i submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other
than  geography  in  addition  to  geographical  origins  there  can  be
what i call an intellectual origin i think you will find that a dispro
portionate  number  of  successful  coinflippers  in  the  investment
world  came  from  a  very  small  intellectual  village  that  could  be
called  grahamanddoddsville  a concentration  of  winners  that
simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu
lar intellectual village

conditions could exist that would make even that concentration
unimportant perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin
flipping  call  of  some  terribly  persuasive  personality  when  he
called heads 100 followers automatically called that coin the same
way if the leader was part of the 215 left at the end the fact that
100  came  from  the  same  intellectual  origin  would  mean  nothing
you would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases sim
ilarly let us assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society

540

appendixes

and every family in the united states conveniently consisted of ten
members  further  assume  that  the  patriarchal  culture  was  so
strong  that  when  the  225  million  people  went  out  the  first  day
every member of the family identified with the fathers call now
at the end of the 20day period you would have 215 winners and
you would find that they came from only 215 families some naive
types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor
as  an  explanation  of  successful  coinflipping  but  of  course  it
would  have  no  significance  at  all  because  it  would  simply  mean
that  you  did not  have  215  individual  winners  but  rather  215  ran
domly distributed families who were winners

in  this  group  of  successful  investors  that  i  want  to  consider
there has been a common intellectual patriarch ben graham but
the  children  who  left  the  house  of  this  intellectual  patriarch  have
called their flips in very different ways they have gone to differ
ent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies yet
they have had a combined record that simply cannot be explained by
random  chance  it  certainly  cannot  be  explained  by  the  fact  that
they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the
calls  to  make  the  patriarch  has  merely  set  forth  the  intellectual
theory  for  making  coincalling  decisions  but  each  student  has
decided on his own manner of applying the theory

the common intellectual theme of the investors from graham
anddoddsville  is  this  they  search  for  discrepancies  between  the
value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in
the  market  essentially  they  exploit  those  discrepancies  without
the efficient market theorists concern as to whether the stocks are
bought  on  monday  or  thursday  or  whether  it  is  january  or  july
etc incidentally when businessmen buy businesseswhich is just
what  our  graham    dodd  investors  are  doing  through  the
medium  of  marketable  stocksi  doubt  that  many  are  cranking
into  their  purchase  decision  the  day  of  the  week  or  the  month  in
which the transaction is going to occur if it does not make any dif
ference whether all of a business is being bought on a monday or a
friday  i  am  baffled  why  academicians  invest  extensive  time  and
effort  to  see  whether  it  makes  a  difference  when  buying  small
pieces  of  those  same  businesses  our  graham    dodd  investors
needless to say do not discuss beta the capital asset pricing model
or covariance in returns among securities these are not subjects of

appendixes

541

any  interest  to  them  in  fact  most  of  them  would  have  difficulty
defining those terms the investors simply focus on two variables
price and value

i always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of
price and volume behavior the stuff of chartists can you imagine
buying an entire business simply because the price of the business
had been marked up substantially last week and the week before
of course the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and
volume  variables  is  that  now  in  the  age  of  computers  there  are
almost  endless  data  available  about  them  it  is not  necessarily
because such studies have any utility its simply that the data are
there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati
cal  skills  needed  to  manipulate  them  once  these  skills  are
acquired it seems sinful not to use them even if the usage has no
utility or negative utility as a friend said to a man with a hammer
everything looks like a nail

i think the group that we have identified by a common intellec
tual home is worthy of study incidentally despite all the academic
studies of the influence of such variables as price volume season
ality  capitalization  size  etc  upon  stock  performance  no  interest
has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con
centration of valueoriented winners

i begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of
us  who  worked  at  grahamnewman  corporation  from  1954
through  1956  there  were  only  fouri  have  not  selected  these
names from among thousands i offered to go to work at graham
newman for nothing after i took ben grahams class but he turned
me  down  as  overvalued  he  took  this  value  stuff  very  seriously
after  much  pestering  he  finally  hired  me  there  were  three  part
ners  and  four  of  us  at  the  peasant  level  all  four  left  between
1955  and  1957  when  the  firm  was  wound  up  and  its  possible  to
trace the record of three

the first example see table 1 pages 549550 is that of walter
schloss walter never went to college but took a course from ben
graham at night at the new york institute of finance walter left
grahamnewman  in  1955  and  achieved  the  record  shown  here
over 28 years

here  is  what  adam  smithafter  i  told  him  about  walter

wrote about him in supermoney 1972

542

appendixes

he has no connections or access to useful information practi
cally no one in wall street knows him and he is not fed any ideas
he looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual
reports and that is about it

in  introducing  me  to  schloss  warren  had  also  to  my  mind
described  himself  he  never  forgets  that  he  is  handling  other
peoples money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to
loss  he  has  total  integrity  and  a  realistic  picture  of  himself
money is real to him and stocks are realand from this flows an
attraction to the margin of safety principle

walter has diversified enormously owning well over 100 stocks
currently he knows how to identify securities that sell at consider
ably less than their value to a private owner and that is all he does
he  does not  worry  about  whether  its  january  he  does not  worry
about whether its monday he does not worry about whether its an
election year he simply says if a business is worth a dollar and i
can buy it for 40 cents something good may happen to me and he
does it over and over and over again he owns many more stocks
than i doand is far less interested in the underlying nature of the
business  i  do not  seem  to  have  very  much  influence  on  walter
that is one of his strengths no one has much influence on him

the  second  case  is  tom  knapp  who  also  worked  at  graham
newman with me tom was a chemistry major at princeton before
the  war  when  he  came  back  from  the  war  he  was  a  beach  bum
and  then  one  day  he  read  that  dave  dodd  was  giving  a  night
course  in  investments  at  columbia  tom  took  it  on  a  noncredit
basis  and  he  got  so  interested  in  the  subject  from  taking  that
course that he came up and enrolled at columbia business school
where he got the mba degree he took dodds course again and
took ben grahams course incidentally 35 years later i called tom
to ascertain some of the facts involved here and i found him on the
beach again the only difference is that now he owns the beach

in 1968 tom knapp and ed anderson also a graham disciple
along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion formed
tweedy  browne  partners  and  their  investment  results  appear  in
table 2 tweedy browne built that record with very wide diversifi
cation  they  occasionally  bought  control  of  businesses  but  the
record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the con
trol investments

table  3  describes  the  third  member  of  the  group  who  formed
buffett  partnership  in  1957  the  best  thing  he  did  was  to  quit  in
1969 since then in a sense berkshire hathaway has been a contin
uation of the partnership in some respects there is no single index
i can give you that i would feel would be a fair test of investment
management at berkshire but i think that any way you figure it it
has been satisfactory

table 4 shows the record of the sequoia fund which is managed
by a man whom i met in 1951 in ben grahams class bill ruane
after  getting  out  of  harvard  business  school  he  went  to  wall
street then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa
tion so he came up to take bens course at columbia where we met
in  early  1951  bills  record  from  1951  to  1970  working  with  rela
tively small sums was far better than average when i wound up
buffett partnership i asked bill if he would set up a fund to handle
all our partners so he set up the sequoia fund he set it up at a ter
rible time just when i was quitting he went right into the twotier
market  and  all  the  difficulties  that  made  for  comparative  perfor
mance  for  valueoriented  investors  i  am  happy  to  say  that  my
partners  to  an  amazing  degree  not  only  stayed  with  him  but
added money with the happy result shown

there is  no  hindsight  involved  here  bill  was  the  only  person  i
recommended  to  my  partners  and  i  said  at  the  time  that  if  he
achieved  a  fourpointperannum  advantage  over  the  standard  
poors  that  would  be  solid  performance  bill  has  achieved  well
over that working with progressively larger sums of money that
makes  things  much  more  difficult  size  is  the  anchor  of  perfor
mance there is no question about it it does not mean you cannot do
better  than  average  when  you  get  larger  but  the  margin  shrinks
and  if  you  ever  get  so  you are  managing  two  trillion  dollars  and
that happens to be the amount of the total equity evaluation in the
economy do not think that you will do better than average

i should add that in the records we have looked at so far through
out this whole period there was practically no duplication in these
portfolios these are men who select securities based on discrepan
cies between price and value but they make their selections very
differently  walters  largest  holdings  have  been  such  stalwarts  as
hudson  pulp    paper  and  jeddo  highland  coal  and  new  york
trap rock company and all those other names that come instantly
to  mind  to  even  a  casual  reader  of  the  business  pages  tweedy

544

appendixes

brownes selections have sunk even well below that level in terms
of name recognition on the other hand bill has worked with big
companies the overlap among these portfolios has been very very
low these records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty
people yelling out the same thing after him

table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a harvard law
graduate who set up a major law firm i ran into him in about 1960
and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better
he set up a partnership quite the opposite of walters his portfo
lio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record
was  much  more  volatile  but  it  was  based  on  the  same  discount
fromvalue approach he was willing to accept greater peaks and
valleys  of  performance  and  he  happens  to  be  a  fellow  whose
whole psyche goes toward concentration with the results shown
incidentally  this  record  belongs  to  charlie  munger  my  partner 
for a long time in the operation of berkshire hathaway when he 
ran  his  partnership  however  his  portfolio  holdings  were  almost
completely  different  from  mine  and  the  other  fellows  mentioned
earlier

table  6  is  the  record  of  a  fellow  who  was  a  pal  of  charlie
mungersanother  nonbusiness  school  typewho  was  a  math
major at usc he went to work for ibm after graduation and was
an ibm salesman for a while after i got to charlie charlie got to
him this happens to be the record of rick guerin rick from 1965
to  1983  against  a  compounded  gain  of  316  percent  for  the  sp
came  off  with  22200  percent  which  probably  because  he  lacks  a
business school education he regards as statistically significant

one sidelight here it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buy
ing  dollar  bills  for  40  cents  takes  immediately  with  people  or  it
does not take at all its like an inoculation if it does not grab a per
son right away i find that you can talk to him for years and show
him  records  and  it  does not  make  any  difference  they  just  do not
seem able to grasp the concept simple as it is a fellow like rick
guerin  who  had  no  formal  education  in  business  understands
immediately the value approach to investing and hes applying it
five minutes later i have never seen anyone who became a gradual
convert over a tenyear period to this approach it does not seem to
be a matter of iq or academic training its instant recognition or it
is nothing

appendixes

545

table  7  is  the  record  of  stan  perlmeter  stan  was  a  liberal  arts
major  at  the  university  of  michigan  who  was  a  partner  in  the
advertising  agency  of  bozell    jacobs  we  happened  to  be  in  the
same building in omaha in 1965 he figured out i had a better busi
ness than he did so he left advertising again it took five minutes
for stan to embrace the value approach

perlmeter does not own what walter schloss owns he does not
own what bill ruane owns these are records made independently
but  every  time  perlmeter  buys  a  stock  its  because  hes  getting
more  for  his  money  than  hes  paying  that is  the  only  thing  hes
thinking about hes not looking at quarterly earnings projections
hes  not  looking  at  next  years  earnings  hes  not  thinking  about
what  day  of  the  week  it  is  he  does not  care  what  investment
research from any place says hes not interested in price momen
tum  volume  or  anything  hes  simply  asking  what  is  the  busi
ness worth

table 8 and table 9 are the records of two pension funds i have been
involved in they are not selected from dozens of pension funds with
which i have had involvement they are the only two i have influ
enced in both cases i have steered them toward valueoriented man
agers  very  very  few  pension  funds  are  managed  from  a  value
standpoint  table  8  is  the  washington  post  companys  pension
fund it was with a large bank some years ago and i suggested that
they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation
as you can see overall they have been in the top percentile ever
since they made the change the post told the managers to keep at
least  25  percent  of  these  funds  in  bonds  which  would  not  have
been necessarily the choice of these managers so i have included the
bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no par
ticular  expertise  about  bonds  they  would not  have  said  they  did
even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was
not  their  game  they  were  in  the  top  percentile  of  fund  manage
ment  the  washington  post  experience  does  not  cover  a  terribly
long  period  but  it  does  represent  many  investment  decisions  by
three managers who were not identified retroactively

table 9 is the record of the fmc corporation fund i do not man
age a dime of it myself but i did in 1974 influence their decision to
select valueoriented managers prior to that time they had selected
managers much the same way as most larger companies they now

546

appendixes

rank  number  one  in  the  becker  survey  of  pension  funds  for  their
size over the period of time subsequent to this conversion to the
value approach last year they had eight equity managers of any
duration  beyond  a  year  seven  of  them  had  a  cumulative  record
better than the sp all eight had a better record last year than the
sp  the  net  difference  now  between  a  median  performance  and
the  actual  performance  of  the  fmc  fund  over  this  period  is  243
million fmc attributes this to the mindset given to them about the
selection  of  managers  those  managers  are  not  the  managers  i
would necessarily select but they have the common denominator
of selecting securities based on value

so these are nine records of coinflippers from grahamand
doddsville  i  have not  selected  them  with  hindsight  from  among
thousands its not like i am reciting to you the names of a bunch of
lottery winnerspeople i had never heard of before they won the
lottery i selected these men years ago based upon their framework
for investment decisionmaking i knew what they had been taught
and additionally i had some personal knowledge of their intellect
character and temperament its very important to understand that
this group has assumed far less risk than average note their record
in  years  when  the  general  market  was  weak  while  they  differ
greatly  in  style  these  investors  are  mentally  always  buying  the
business not buying the stock a few of them sometimes buy whole
businesses  far  more  often  they  simply  buy  small  pieces  of  busi
nesses their attitude whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi
ness  is  the  same  some  of  them  hold  portfolios  with  dozens  of
stocks  others  concentrate  on  a  handful  but  all  exploit  the  differ
ence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value
i am  convinced  that  there  is  much  inefficiency  in  the  market
these  grahamanddoddsville  investors  have  successfully  ex
ploited  gaps  between  price  and  value  when  the  price  of  a  stock
can be influenced by a herd on wall street with prices set at the
margin by the most emotional person or the greediest person or
the  most  depressed  person  it  is  hard  to  argue  that  the  market
always prices rationally in fact market prices are frequently non
sensical

i would like to say one important thing about risk and reward
sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion if
someone were to say to me i have here a sixshooter and i have

slipped one cartridge into it why do not you just spin it and pull it
once if you survive i will give you 1 million i would decline
perhaps stating that 1 million is not enough then he might offer
me 5 million to pull the trigger twicenow that would be a posi
tive correlation between risk and reward

the exact opposite is true with value investing if you buy a dol
lar  bill  for  60  cents  its  riskier  than  if  you  buy  a  dollar  bill  for 
40 cents but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case
the greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio the less
risk there is

one quick example the washington post company in 1973 was
selling  for  80  million  in  the  market  at  the  time  that  day  you
could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than
400 million probably appreciably more the company owned the
post  newsweek plus  several  television  stations  in  major  markets
those same properties are worth 2 billion now so the person who
would have paid 400 million would not have been crazy

now if the stock had declined even further to a price that made
the  valuation  40  million  instead  of  80  million  its  beta  would
have been greater and to people who think beta measures risk the
cheaper price would have made it look riskier this is truly alice in
wonderland i have never been able to figure out why its riskier to
buy 400 million worth of properties for 40 million than 80 mil
lion and as a matter of fact if you buy a group of such securities
and  you  know  anything  at  all  about  business  valuation  there  is
essentially no risk in buying 400 million for 80 million particu
larly if you do it by buying ten 40 million piles for 8 million each
since you do not have your hands on the 400 million you want to
be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people
but that is not a difficult job

you also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a
very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses
but  you  do  not  cut  it  close  that  is  what  ben  graham  meant  by
having a margin of safety you do not try and buy businesses worth
83 million for 80 million you leave yourself an enormous mar
gin  when  you  build  a  bridge  you  insist  it  can  carry  30000
pounds but you only drive 10000pound trucks across it and that
same principle works in investing

in  conclusion  some  of  the  more  commercially  minded  among

548

appendixes

you may wonder why i am writing this article adding many con
verts  to  the  value  approach  will  perforce  narrow  the  spreads
between price and value i can only tell you that the secret has been
out  for  50  years  ever  since  ben  graham  and  dave  dodd  wrote
security analysis yet i have seen no trend toward value investing
in the 35 years that i have practiced it there seems to be some per
verse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult
the  academic  world  if  anything  has  actually  backed  away  from
the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years its likely to
continue  that  way  ships  will  sail  around  the  world  but  the  flat
earth society will flourish there will continue to be wide discrep
ancies between price and value in the marketplace and those who
read their graham  dodd will continue to prosper

2 important rules concerning taxability of investment
income and security transactions in 1972

editors  note  due  to  extensive  changes  in  the  rules  governing  such
transactions  the  following  document  is  presented  here  for  historical
purposes only when first written by benjamin graham in 1972 all the
information  therein  was  correct  however  intervening  developments
have rendered this document inaccurate for todays purposes follow
ing grahams original appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of
the  basics  of  investment  taxation  which  brings  the  reader  upto
date on the relevant rules

rule 1interest and dividends

interest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except a
income  received  from  state  municipal  and  similar  obligations
which are free from federal tax but may be subject to state tax b
dividends  representing  a  return  of  capital  c  certain  dividends
paid by investment companies see below and d the first 100 of
ordinary domesticcorporation dividends

rule 2capital gains and losses

shortterm  capital  gains  and  losses  are  merged  to  obtain  net
shortterm capital gain or loss longterm capital gains and losses
are merged to obtain the net longterm capital gain or loss if the
net shortterm capital gain exceeds the net longterm capital loss
100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income the maxi
mum tax thereon is 25 up to 50000 of such gains and 35 on the
balance

a net  capital  loss  the  amount  exceeding  capital  gains  is
deductible  from  ordinary  income  to  a  maximum  of  1000  in  the
current  year  and  in  each  of  the  next  five  years  alternatively
unused  losses  may  be  applied  at  any  time  to  offset  capital  gains
carryovers of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally
than later losses

note concerning regulated investment companies

most  investment  funds  investment  companies  take  advan
tage of special provisions of the tax law which enable them to be

562

appendixes

taxed  substantially  as  partnerships  thus  if  they  make  longterm
security  profits  they  can  distribute  these  as  capitalgain  divi
dends which are reported by their shareholders in the same way
as longterm gains these carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi
dends alternatively such a company may elect to pay the 25 tax
for  the  account  of  its  shareholders  and  then  retain  the  balance  of
the  capital  gains  without  distributing  them  as  capitalgain  divi
dends

3 the basics of investment taxation updated as of 2003

interest and dividends

interest  and  dividends  are  taxed  at  your  ordinaryincome  tax  rate
except a interest received from municipal bonds which is free from
federal income tax but may be subject to state tax b dividends rep
resenting  a  return  of  capital  and  c  longterm  capitalgain  distribu
tions  paid  by  mutual  funds  see  below  privateactivity  municipal
bonds even within a mutual fund may subject you to the federal alter
native minimum tax

capital gains and losses

shortterm capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short
term  capital  gain  or  loss  longterm  capital  gains  and  losses  are
merged to determine your net longterm capital gain or loss if your net
shortterm  capital  gain  exceeds  the  net  longterm  capital  loss  that
excess is counted as ordinary income if there is a net longterm capi
tal gain it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate generally 20
which will fall to 18 for investments purchased after december 31
2000 and held for more than five years

a net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim
um  of  3000  in  the  current  year  any  capital  losses  in  excess  of
3000  may  be  applied  in  later  tax  years  to  offset  future  capital 
gains

mutual funds

as regulated investment companies nearly all mutual funds take
advantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from

appendixes

563

corporate  income  tax  after  selling  longterm  holdings  mutual  funds
can distribute the profits as capitalgain dividends which their share
holders treat as longterm gains these are taxed at a lower rate gen
erally 20 than ordinary dividends up to 39 you should generally
avoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter of each
year when these capitalgain distributions are usually distributed oth
erwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund before you even
owned it

4 the new speculation in common stocks1

what i shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years
in wall street with their attendant varieties of experience this has
included  the  recurrent  advent  of  new  conditions  or  a  new  atmo
sphere which challenge the value of experience itself it is true that
one of the elements that distinguish economics finance and secu
rity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid
ity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future yet we
have no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least
studied  and  understood  them  my  address  today  is  an  effort
toward  such  understanding  in  a  limited  fieldin  particular  an
endeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the
present  and  the  past  in  our  underlying  attitudes  toward  invest
ment and speculation in common stocks

let me start with a summary of my thesis in the past the specu
lative  elements  of  a  common  stock  resided  almost  exclusively  in
the  company  itself  they  were  due  to  uncertainties  or  fluctuating
elements or downright weaknesses in the industry or the corpora
tions individual setup these elements of speculation still exist of
course but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished
by a number of longterm developments to which i shall refer but
in revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro
duced into the commonstock arena from outside the companies it
comes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stockbuying public
and their adviserschiefly us security analysts this attitude may
be described in a phrase primary emphasis upon future expecta
tions

nothing  will  appear  more  logical  and  natural  to  this  audience
than  the  idea  that  a  common  stock  should  be  valued  and  priced

564

appendixes

primarily  on  the  basis  of  the  companys  expected  future  perfor
mance yet this simpleappearing concept carries with it a number
of paradoxes and pitfalls for one thing it obliterates a good part of
the  older  wellestablished  distinctions  between  investment  and
speculation  the  dictionary  says  that  speculate  comes  from  the
latin specula a lookout thus it was the speculator who looked
out and saw future developments coming before other people did
but  today  if  the  investor  is  shrewd  or  well  advised  he  too  must
have his lookout on the future or rather he mounts into a common
lookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator

secondly  we  find  that  for  the  most  part  companies  with  the
best investment characteristicsie the best credit ratingare the
ones  which  are  likely  to  attract  the  largest  speculative  interest  in
their common stocks since everyone assumes they are guaranteed
a brilliant future thirdly the concept of future prospects and par
ticularly of continued growth in the future invites the application
of  formulas  out  of  higher  mathematics  to  establish  the  present
value of the favored issues but the combination of precise formu
las with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish or
rather  to  justify  practically  any  value  one  wishes  however  high
for a really outstanding issue but paradoxically that very fact on
close examination will be seen to imply that no one value or rea
sonably narrow range of values can be counted on to establish and
maintain  itself  for  a  given  growth  company  hence  at  times  the
market  may  conceivably  value  the  growth  component  at  a  strik
ingly low figure

returning to my distinction between the older and newer spec
ulative elements in common stock we might characterize them by
two outlandish but convenient words viz endogenous and exoge
nous  let  me  illustrate  briefly  the  oldtime  speculative  common
stock  as  distinguished  from  an  investment  stock  by  some  data
relating to american can and pennsylvania railroad in 19111913
these  appear  in  benjamin  graham  and  david  l  dodd  security
analysis mcgrawhill 1940 pp 23

in  those  three  years  the  price  range  of  pennsy  moved  only
between 53 and 65 or between 122 and 15 times its average earn
ings for the period it showed steady profits was paying a reliable
3  dividend  and  investors  were  sure  that  it  was  backed  by  well
over its par of 50 in tangible assets by contrast the price of amer

appendixes

565

ican  can  ranged  between  9  and  47  its  earnings  between  7  cents
and  886  the  ratio  of  price  to  the  threeyear  average  earnings
moved between 19 times and 10 times it paid no dividend at all
and  sophisticated  investors  were  well  aware  that  the  100  par
value  of  the  common  represented  nothing  but  undisclosed
water  since  the  preferred  issue  exceeded  the  tangible  assets
available for it thus american can common was a representative
speculative  issue  because  american  can  company  was  then  a
speculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain
industry  actually  american  can  had  a  far  more  brilliant  long
term future than pennsylvania railroad but not only was this fact
not suspected by investors or speculators in those days but even if
it had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors
as basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the
years 19111913

now  to  expose  you  to  the  development  through  time  of  the
importance of longterm prospects for investments i should like to
use  as  my  example  our  most  spectacular  giant  industrial  enter
prisenone  other  than  international  business  machines  which
last  year  entered  the  small  group  of  companies  with  1  billion  of
sales may i introduce one or two autobiographical notes here in
order  to  inject  a  little  of  the  personal  touch  into  what  otherwise
would be an excursion into cold figures in 1912 i had left college
for a term to take charge of a research project for us express com
pany we set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo
lutionary new system of computing express rates for this purpose
we  used  the  socalled  hollerith  machines  leased  out  by  the  then
computingtabulatingrecording company they comprised card
punches  card  sorters  and  tabulatorstools  almost  unknown  to
businessmen then and having their chief application in the cen
sus  bureau  i  entered  wall  street  in  1914  and  the  next  year  the
bonds and common stock of ctr company were listed on the
new york stock exchange well i had a kind of sentimental inter
est  in  that  enterprise  and  besides  i  considered  myself  a  sort  of
technological expert on their products being one of the few finan
cial people who had seen and used them so early in 1916 i went to
the head of my firm known as mr a n and pointed out to him
that  ctr  stock  was  selling  in  the  middle  40s  for  105000
shares  that  it  had  earned  650  in  1915  that  its  book  value

566

appendixes

including to be sure some nonsegregated intangibleswas 130
that it had started a 3 dividend and that i thought rather highly of
the  companys  products  and  prospects  mr  a  n  looked  at  me
pityingly  ben  said  he  do  not  mention  that  company  to  me
again  i  would  not  touch  it  with  a  tenfoot  pole  his  favorite
expression its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they
are no good so how can the stock be any good everybody knows
there is nothing behind it but water glossary in those days that
was the ultimate of condemnation it meant that the asset account
of  the  balance  sheet  was  fictitious  many  industrial  companies
notably us steeldespite their 100 par represented nothing but
water  concealed  in  a  writtenup  plant  account  since  they  had
nothing  to  back  them  but  earning  power  and  future  prospects
no selfrespecting investor would give them a second thought

i  returned  to  my  statisticians  cubbyhole  a  chastened  young
man  mr  a  n  was  not  only  experienced  and  successful  but
extremely shrewd as well so much was i impressed by his sweep
ing  condemnation  of  computingtabulatingrecording  that  i
never bought a share of it in my life not even after its name was
changed to international business machines in 1926

now let us take a look at the same company with its new name
in  1926  a  year  of  pretty  high  stock  markets  at  that  time  it  first
revealed the goodwill item in its balance sheet in the rather large
sum of 136 million a n had been right practically every dollar
of the socalled equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth
ing but water however since that time the company had made an
impressive  record  under  the  direction  of  t  l  watson  sr  its  net
had  risen  from  691000  to  37  millionover  fivefolda  greater
percentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent elevenyear
period it had built up a nice tangible equity for the common and
had split it 36 for one it had established a 3 dividend rate for the
new  stock  while  earnings  were  639  thereon  you  might  have
expected  the  1926  stock  market  to  have  been  pretty  enthusiastic
about a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade
position  let  us  see  the  price  range  for  that  year  was  31  low  59
high at the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7times multi
plier of earnings and the same 67 per cent dividend yield as it had
done in 1915 at its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible
book value and in that respect was far more conservatively priced
than eleven years earlier

appendixes

567

these  data  illustrate  as  well  as  any  can  the  persistence  of  the
oldtime  investment  viewpoint  until  the  culminating  years  of  the
bull  market  of  the  1920s  what  has  happened  since  then  can  be
summarized  by  using  tenyear  intervals  in  the  history  of  ibm  in
1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures and the average multi
plier rose from 7 to 1712 from 1936 to 1946 the gain was 212 times
but the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 1712 then the pace
accelerated the 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946 and the
average multiplier rose to 3212 last year with a further gain in net
the multiplier rose again to an average of 42 if we do not count the
unconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary

when  we  examine  these  recent  price  figures  with  care  we  see
some interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years
earlier the onetime scandalous water so prevalent in the balance
sheets of industrial companies has all been squeezed outfirst by
disclosure and then by writeoffs but a different kind of water has
been put back into the valuation by the stock marketby investors
and  speculators  themselves  when  ibm  now  sells  at  7  times  its
book value instead of 7 times earnings the effect is practically the
same as if it had no book value at all or the small bookvalue por
tion  can  be  considered  as  a  sort  of  minor  preferredstock  compo
nent  of  the  price  the  rest  representing  exactly  the  same  sort  of
commitment  as  the  oldtime  speculator  made  when  he  bought
woolworth or us steel common entirely for their earning power
and future prospects

it is worth remarking in passing that in the thirty years which
saw ibm transformed from a 7times earnings to a 40times earn
ings enterprise many of what i have called the endogenous specu
lative  aspects  of  our  large  industrial  companies  have  tended  to
disappear or at least to diminish greatly their financial positions
are firm their capital structures conservative they are managed far
more expertly and even more honestly than before furthermore
the requirements of complete disclosure have removed one of the
important  speculative  elements  of  years  agothat  derived  from
ignorance and mystery

another personal digression here in my early years in the street
one  of  the  favorite  mystery  stocks  was  consolidated  gas  of  new
york now consolidated edison it owned as a subsidiary the prof
itable new york edison company but it reported only dividends
received from this source not its full earnings the unreported edi

568

appendixes

son earnings supplied the mystery and the hidden value to my
surprise i discovered that these hushhush figures were actually on
file  each  year  with  the  public  service  commission  of  the  state  it
was a simple matter to consult the records and to present the true
earnings  of  consolidated  gas  in  a  magazine  article  incidentally
the  addition  to  profits  was  not  spectacular  one  of  my  older
friends said to me then ben you may think you are a great guy to
supply those missing figures but wall street is going to thank you
for nothing consolidated gas with the mystery is both more inter
esting  and  more  valuable  than  exmystery  you  youngsters  who
want  to  stick  your  noses  into  everything  are  going  to  ruin  wall
street

it is true that the three ms which then supplied so much fuel to
the  speculative  fires  have  now  all  but  disappeared  these  were
mystery  manipulation  and  thin  margins  but  we  security  ana
lysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are
so  speculative  in  themselves  as  to  pretty  well  take  the  place  of
those  older  speculative  factors  do  we  not  have  our  own  3ms
nownone  other  than  minnesota  mining  and  manufacturing
companyand does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the
new  speculation  as  contrasted  with  the  old  consider  a  few  fig
ures when m m  m common sold at 101 last year the market
was valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings which happened to show
no increase to speak of in 1957 the enterprise itself was valued at
17 billion of which 200 million was covered by net assets and a
cool 112 billion represented the markets appraisal of good will
we do not know the process of calculation by which that valuation
of good will was arrived at we do know that a few months later
the market revised this appraisal downward by some 450 million
or about 30 per cent obviously it is impossible to calculate accu
rately  the  intangible  component  of  a  splendid  company  such  as
this it follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor
tant the good will or future earningpower factor the more uncer
tain  becomes  the  true  value  of  the  enterprise  and  therefore  the
more speculative inherently the common stock

it may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed
in the valuation of these intangible factors when we compare ear
lier times with today a generation or more ago it was the standard
rule recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal

appendixes

569

valuations that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conser
vative  basis  than  tangibles a good  industrial  company  might  be
required to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible
assets represented typically by bonds and preferred stock but its
excess earnings or the intangible assets they gave rise to would be
valued  on  say  a  15  per  cent  basis  you  will  find  approximately
these ratios in the initial offering of woolworth preferred and com
mon  stock  in  1911  and  in  numerous  others  but  what  has  hap
pened  since  the  1920s  essentially  the  exact  reverse  of  these
relationships  may  now  be  seen  a company  must  now  typically
earn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the
average market at full book value but its excess earnings above 10
per cent on capital are usually valued more liberally or at a higher
multiplier  than  the  base  earnings  required  to  support  the  book
value  in  the  market  thus  a  company  earning  15  per  cent  on  the
equity may well sell at 1312 times earnings or twice its net assets
this would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val
ued  at  only  10  times  but  the  next  5  per  centwhat  used  to  be
called the excessis actually valued at 20 times

now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce
dure which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta
tions companies that earn a high return on capital are given these
liberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself
and the relative stability associated with it but perhaps even more
cogently  because  high  earnings  on  capital  generally  go  hand  in
hand with a good growth record and prospects thus what is really
paid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not
the good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name
and a profitable business but rather their assumed superior expec
tations of increased profits in the future

this brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of
the  new  attitude  toward  commonstock  valuations  which  i  shall
touch on merely in the form of brief suggestions if as many tests
show the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability
ie as the rate of return on book value increasesthen the arith
metical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase
directly as the square of the earnings but inversely the book value
thus  in  an  important  and  very  real  sense  tangible  assets  have
become  a  drag  on  average  market  value  rather  than  a  source

570

appendixes

thereof take a far from extreme illustration if company a earns 4
a  share  on  a  20  book  value  and  company  b  also  4  a  share  on
100  book  value  company a is  almost  certain  to  sell  at  a  higher
multiplier and hence at higher price than company bsay 60 for
company a shares and 35 for company b shares thus it would
not be inexact to declare that the 80 per share of greater assets for
company  b  are  responsible  for  the  25  per  share  lower  market
price since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal

but  more  important  than  the  foregoing  is  the  general  relation
ship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values
given the three ingredients of a optimistic assumptions as to the
rate  of  earnings  growth  b  a  sufficiently  long  projection  of  this
growth  into  the  future  and  c  the  miraculous  workings  of  com
pound  interestlo  the  security  analyst  is  supplied  with  a  new
kind  of  philosophers  stone  which  can  produce  or  justify  any
desired valuation for a really good stock i have commented in a
recent article in the analysts journal on the vogue of higher mathe
matics in bull markets and quoted david durands exposition of
the  striking  analogy  between  value  calculations  of  growth  stocks
and  the  famous  petersburg  paradox  which  has  challenged  and
confused  mathematicians  for  more  than  two  hundred  years  the
point i want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the
relationship  between  mathematics  and  investment  attitudes  on
common  stocks  which  is  this  mathematics  is  ordinarily  consid
ered as producing precise and dependable results but in the stock
market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more
uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom
in fortyfour years of wall street experience and study i have never
seen dependable calculations made about commonstock values or
related investment policies that went beyond simple arithmetic or
the  most  elementary  algebra  whenever  calculus  is  brought  in 
or  higher  algebra  you  could  take  it  as  a  warning  signal  that  the
operator  was  trying  to  substitute  theory  for  experience  and  usu
ally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment

the  older  ideas  of  commonstock  investment  may  seem  quite
naive  to  the  sophisticated  security  analyst  of  today  the  great
emphasis was always on what we now call the defensive aspects of
the  company  or  issuemainly  the  assurance  that  it  would  con
tinue  its  dividend  unreduced  in  bad  times  thus  the  strong  rail

roads which constituted the standard investment commons of fifty
years ago were actually regarded in very much the same way as
the publicutility commons in recent years if the past record indi
cated stability the chief requirement was met not too much effort
was made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying character
in the future but conversely especially favorable future prospects
were  regarded  by  shrewd  investors  as  something  to  look  for  but
not to pay for

in  effect  this  meant  that  the  investor  did  not  have  to  pay  any
thing  substantial  for  superior  longterm  prospects  he  got  these
virtually without extra cost as a reward for his own superior intel
ligence  and  judgment  in  picking  the  best  rather  than  the  merely
good  companies  for  common  stocks  with  the  same  financial
strength  past  earnings  record  and  dividend  stability  all  sold  at
about the same dividend yield

this  was  indeed  a  shortsighted  point  of  view  but  it  had  the
great  advantage  of  making  commonstock  investment  in  the  old
days  not  only  simple  but  also  basically  sound  and  highly  prof
itable  let  me  return  for  the  last  time  to  a  personal  note  some
where around 1920 our firm distributed a series of little pamphlets
entitled lessons for investors of course it took a brash analyst in his
middle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a
title but in one of the papers i made the casual statement that if a
common stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation
for reasoned i if a common stock was so sound that it carried very
little risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel
lent  chances  for  future  gains  now  this  was  a  perfectly  true  and
even valuable discovery but it was true only because nobody paid
any attention to it some years later when the public woke up to
the  historical  merits  of  common  stocks  as  longterm  investments
they  soon  ceased  to  have  any  such  merit  because  the  publics
enthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built
in  margin  of  safety  and  thus  drove  them  out  of  the  investment
class then of course the pendulum swung to the other extreme
and we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring
in 1931 that no common stock could ever be an investment

when  we  view  this  longrange  experience  in  perspective  we
find  another  set  of  paradoxes  in  the  investors  changing  attitude
toward capital gains as contrasted with income it seems a truism

572

appendixes

to  say  that  the  oldtime  commonstock  investor  was  not  much
interested in capital gains he bought almost entirely for safety and
income and let the speculator concern himself with price apprecia
tion  today  we  are  likely  to  say  that  the  more  experienced  and
shrewd the investor the less attention he pays to dividend returns
and  the  more  heavily  his  interest  centers  on  longterm  apprecia
tion  yet  one  might  argue  perversely  that  precisely  because  the
oldtime  investor  did  not  concentrate  on  future  capital  apprecia
tion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it
at  least  in  the  field  of  industrial  stocks  and  conversely  todays
investor  is  so  concerned  with  anticipating  the  future  that  he  is
already  paying  handsomely  for  it  in  advance  thus  what  he  has
projected with so much study and care may actually happen and
still not bring him any profit if it should fail to materialize to the
degree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary
and perhaps even permanent loss

what lessonsagain using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam
phletcan the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with
current attitudes not much of value one is inclined to say we can
look back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for
the present and could get the future for nothingan all this and
heaven  too  combination  shaking  our  heads  sadly  we  mutter
those  days  are  gone  forever  have  not  investors  and  security
analysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects
by so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves from
that  eden  where  promising  common  stocks  at  reasonable  prices
could be plucked off the bushes are we doomed always to run the
risk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and
prospects  or  of  getting  poor  quality  and  prospects  when  we  pay
what seems a reasonable price

it certainly looks that way yet one cannot be sure even of that
pessimistic  dilemma  recently  i  did  a  little  research  in  the  long
term history of that towering enterprise general electricstimu
lated  by  the  arresting  chart  of  fiftynine  years  of  earnings  and
dividends appearing in their recently published 1957 report these
figures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana
lyst for one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of g e
was fairly modest and quite irregular the 1946 earnings per share
adjusted were only 30 per cent higher than in 190252 cents ver

573

sus 40 centsand in no year of this period were the 1902 earnings
as much as doubled yet the priceearnings ratio rose from 9 times
in 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946 one might
say  of  course  that  the  1946  multiplier  at  least  showed  the  well
known  prescience  of  shrewd  investors  we  analysts  were  able  to
foresee then the really brilliant period of growth that was looming
ahead  in  the  next  decade  maybe  so  but  some  of  you  remember
that the next year 1947 which established an impressive new high
for ges pershare earnings was marked also by an extraordinary
fall in the priceearnings ratio at its low of 32 before the 3for1
split ge actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings
and its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings
our crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve
months

this striking reversal took place only eleven years ago it casts
some little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of
the  popular  belief  among  analysts  that  prominent  and  promising
companies will now always sell at high priceearnings ratiosthat
this is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well
accept  and  like  it  i  have  no  desire  at  all  to  be  dogmatic  on  this
point all i can say is that it is not settled in my mind and each of
you must seek to settle it for yourself

but  in  my  concluding  remarks  i  can  say  something  definite
about  the  structure  of  the  market  for  various  types  of  common
stocks in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics
in  the  old  days  the  investment  character  of  a  common  stock  was
more or less the same as or proportionate with that of the enter
prise itself as measured quite well by its credit rating the lower
the  yield  on  its  bonds  or  preferred  the  more  likely  was  the  com
mon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment and the
smaller  the  element  of  speculation  involved  in  its  purchase  this
relationship between the speculative ranking of the common and
the  investment  rating  of  the  company  could  be  graphically
expressed  pretty  much  as  a  straight  line  descending  from  left  to
right  but  nowadays  i  would  describe  the  graph  as  ushaped at
the left where the company itself is speculative and its credit low
the  common  stock  is  of  course  highly  speculative  just  as  it  has
always been in the past at the right extremity however where the
company has the highest credit rating because both its past record

574

appendixes

and  future  prospects  are  most  impressive  we  find  that  the  stock
market tends more or less continuously to introduce a highly spec
ulative element into the common shares through the simple means
of a price so high as to carry a fair degree of risk

at  this  point  i  cannot  forbear  introducing  a  surprisingly  rele
vant if quite exaggerated quotation on the subject which i found
recently in one of shakespeares sonnets it reads

have i not seen dwellers on form and favor
lose all and more by paying too much rent

returning  to  my  imaginary  graph  it  would  be  the  center  area
where the speculative element in commonstock purchases would
tend to reach its minimum in this area we could find many well
established  and  strong  companies  with  a  record  of  past  growth
corresponding  to  that  of  the  national  economy  and  with  future
prospects  apparently  of  the  same  character  such  common  stocks
could be bought at most times except in the upper ranges of a bull
market  at  moderate  prices  in  relation  to  their  indicated  intrinsic
values  as  a  matter  of  fact  because  of  the  present  tendency  of
investors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorous
issues  i  should  hazard  the  statement  that  these  middleground
stocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independently
determinable values they thus have a marginofsafety factor sup
plied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to
destroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues further
more in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for
penetrating  analysis  of  the  past  record  and  for  discriminating
choice  in  the  area  of  future  prospects  to  which  can  be  added  the
higher assurance of safety conferred by diversification

when  phaethon  insisted  on  driving  the  chariot  of  the  sun  his
father  the  experienced  operator  gave  the  neophyte  some  advice
which  the  latter  failed  to  followto  his  cost  ovid  summed  up

5 a case history aetna maintenance co

the first part of this history is reproduced from our 1965 edition
where it appeared under the title a horrible example the sec
ond part summarizes the later metamorphosis of the enterprise

we think it might have a salutary effect on our readers future
attitude toward new commonstock offerings if we cited one hor
rible example here in some detail it is taken from the first page of
standard    poors  stock  guide and  illustrates  in  extreme  fashion
the  glaring  weaknesses  of  the  19601962  flotations  the  extraordi
nary overvaluations given them in the market and the subsequent
collapse

in  november  1961  154000  shares  of  aetna  maintenance  co
common  were  sold  to  public  at  9  and  the  price  promptly
advanced to 15 before the financing the net assets per share were
about 120 but they were increased to slightly over 3 per share
by the money received for the new shares

the nature of this highly competitive business to insure future sta
bility at the high price soon after issuance the heedless public was
paying much more per dollar of earnings and assets than for most
of  our  large  and  strong  companies  this  example  is  admittedly
extreme but it is far from unique the instances of lesser but inex
cusable overvaluations run into the hundreds

sequel 19651970

in 1965 new interests came into the company the unprofitable
buildingmaintenance business was sold out and the company them
barked in an entirely different venture making electronic devices
the name was changed to haydon switch and instrument co the
earnings  results  have  not  been  impressive  in  the  five  years
19651969 the enterprise showed average earnings of only 8 cents
per share of old stock with 34 cents earned in the best year 1967
however in true modern style the company split the stock 2 for 1 in
1968 the market price also ran true to wall street form it advanced
from 78 in 1964 to the equivalent of 1612 in 1968 after the split the
price now exceeded the record set in the enthusiastic days of 1961
this time the overvaluation was much worse than before the stock
was now selling at 52 times the earnings of its only good year and
some 200 times its average earnings also the company was again to
report a deficit in the very year that the new high price was estab
lished the next year 1969 the bid price fell to 1

questions  did  the  idiots  who  paid  8  for  this  stock  in  1968
know  anything  at  all  about  the  companys  previous  history  its
fiveyear  earnings  record  its  asset  value  very  small  did  they
have any idea of how muchor rather how littlethey were get

6 tax accounting for nvfs acquisition of sharon 
steel shares

share  70  in  nvf  5  bonds  due  1994  and  warrants  to  buy  112

appendixes

577

shares  of  nvf  at  22  per  share  the  initial  market  value  of  the
bonds  appears  to  have  been  only  43  of  par  while  the  warrants
were  quoted  at  10  per  nvf  share  involved  this  meant  that  the
sharon holders got only 30 worth of bonds but 15 worth of war
rants  for  each  share  turned  in  a  total  of  45  per  share  this  was
about the average price of sharon in 1968 and also its closing price
for the year the book value of sharon was 60 per share the dif
ference  between  this  book  value  and  the  market  value  of  sharon
stock  amounted  to  about  21  million  on  the  1415000  shares  of
sharon acquired

2 the accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three
things a to treat  the  issuance  of  the  bonds  as  equivalent  to  a
sale thereof at 43 giving the company an annual deduction from
income for amortization of the huge bond discount of 54 million
actually it would be charging itself about 15 annual interest on
the proceeds of the 99 million debenture issue b to offset this
bonddiscount charge by an approximately equal profit consist
ing of a credit to income of onetenth of the difference between the
cost price of 45 for the sharon stock and its book value of 60 this
would  correspond  in  reverse  fashion  to  the  required  practice  of
charging income each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi
tions  in  excess of  the  book  value  of  the  assets  acquired  c the
beauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save
initially about 900000 a year or 1 per share in income taxes from
these  two  annual  entries  because  the  amortization  of  bond  dis
count could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization
of excess of equity over cost did not have to be included in tax
able income

3 this  accounting  treatment  is  reflected  in  both  the  consoli
dated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of nvf
for 1969 and pro forma for 1968 since a good part of the cost of
sharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants it was nec
essary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of
the commonstock capital figure thus in this case as in no other
that  we  know  the  warrants  were  assigned  a  substantial  value  in
the balance sheet namely 22 million but only in an explanatory
note

7 technological companies as investments

in the standard  poors services in mid1971 there were listed
about  200  companies  with  names  beginning  with  compu  data
electro scien techno about half of these belonged to some part
of the computer industry all of them were traded in the market or
had made applications to sell stock to the public

a total of 46 such companies appeared in the s  p stock guide
for  september  1971  of  these  26  were  reporting  deficits  only  six
were  earning  over  1  per  share  and  only  five  were  paying  divi
dends

in the december 1968 stock guide there had appeared 45 compa
nies  with  similar  technological  names  tracing  the  sequel  of  this
list as shown in the september 1971 guide we find the following

comment  it  is  virtually  certain  that  the  many  technological
companies  not  included  in  the  guide in  1968  had  a  poorer  subse
quent record than those that were included also that the 12 compa
nies dropped from the list did worse than those that were retained
the  harrowing  results  shown  by  these  samples  are  no  doubt  rea
sonably  indicative  of  the  quality  and  price  history  of  the  entire
group of technology issues the phenomenal success of ibm and
a  few  other  companies  was  bound  to  produce  a  spate  of  public

sidney  cottle  and  charles  tatham  mcgrawhill  4th  ed  1962
retains  the  title  originally  chosen  in  1934  but  it  covers  much  of  the
scope of financial analysis

2 with  charles  mcgolrick  harper    row  1964  reissued  by  harper

business 1998

3 these figures are from salomon bros a large new york bond house
4 at  least  not  by  the  great  body  of  security  analysts  and  investors
exceptional  analysts  who  can  tell  in  advance  what  companies  are
likely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and capability
to make it may have continued success with this work for details of
such  an  approach  see  philip  fisher  common  stocks  and  uncommon
profits harper  row 1960

5 on  p  295  we  set  forth  a  formula  relating  multipliers  to  the  rate  of

expected growth

6 part  of  the  fireworks  in  the  price  of  chrysler  was  undoubtedly
inspired  by  two  twoforone  stock  splits  taking  place  in  the  single
year  1963an  unprecedented  phenomenon  for  a  major  company in
the early 1980s under lee iacocca chrysler did a threepeat coming
back from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the bestperforming
stocks  in  america  however  identifying  managers  who  can  lead  great
corporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems when al dunlap took
over  sunbeam  corp  in  1996  after  restructuring  scott  paper  co  and
driving its stock price up 225 in 18 months wall street hailed him as
little short of the second coming dunlap turned out to be a sham who
used  improper  accounting  and  false  financial  statements  to  mislead
sunbeams  investorsincluding  the  revered  money  managers  michael
price and michael steinhardt who had hired him for a keen dissection
of  dunlaps  career  see  john  a  byrne  chainsaw harpercollins  new
york 1999

7 note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the true value
of  a  growth  stock  but  only  that  it  approximates  the  results  of  the
more elaborate calculations in vogue

chapter 12 things to consider about pershare earnings

1 our  recommended  method  of  dealing  with  the  warrant  dilution  is
discussed below we prefer to consider the market value of the war
rants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock
as a whole

chapter 13 a comparison of four listed companies

1 in march 1972 emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings

chapter 14 stock selection for the defensive investor

1 because of numerous stock splits etc through the years the actual
average price of the djia list was about 53 per share in early 1972
2 in 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current
assets  equal  to  twice  current  liabilities  and  only  two  failed  to  have
net current assets exceeding their debt by december 1970 the num
ber in each category had grown from two to twelve

3 but  note  that  their  combined  market  action  from  december  1970  to
early 1972 was poorer than that of the djia this demonstrates once
again  that  no  system  or  formula  will  guarantee  superior  market
results our requirements guarantee only that the portfoliobuyer is
getting his moneys worth

4 as  a  consequence  we  must  exclude  the  majority  of  gas  pipeline
stocks  since  these  enterprises  are  heavily  bonded  the  justification
for this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which
guarantee bond payments but the considerations here may be too
complicated for the needs of a defensive investor

chapter 15 stock selection for the enterprising investor

1 mutual  funds  and  other  institutional  investors  a new  perspective
i friend m blume and j crockett mcgrawhill 1970 we should
add that the 19661970 results of many of the funds we studied were

endnotes

somewhat better than those of the standard  poors 500stock com
posite and considerably better than those of the djia

2 personal  note  many  years  before  the  stockmarket  pyrotechnics  in
that particular company the author was its financial vicepresident
at the princely salary of 3000 per annum it was then really in the
fireworks business in early 1929 graham became a financial vice pres
ident of unexcelled manufacturing co the nations largest producer of
fireworks unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and
no longer exists in independent form

3 the guide does not show multipliers above 99 most such would be
mathematical oddities caused by earnings just above the zero point

chapter 16 convertible issues and warrants

1 this  point  is  well  illustrated  by  an  offering  of  two  issues  of  ford
motor finance co made simultaneously in november 1971 one was
a 20year nonconvertible bond yielding 712 the other was a 25year
bond  subordinated  to  the  first  in  order  of  claim  and  yielding  only
412 but it was made convertible into ford motor stock against its
then price of 6812 to obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave
up 40 of income and accepted a juniorcreditor position

2 note that in late 1971 studebakerworthington common sold as low
as 38 while the 5 preferred sold at or about 77 the spread had thus
grown from 2 to 20 points during the year illustrating once more the
desirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar
ket to neglect arithmetic incidentally the small premium of the pre
ferred over the common in december 1970 had already been made up
by its higher dividend

chapter 17 four extremely instructive case histories

1 see  for  example  the  article  six  flags  at  half  mast  by  dr  a  j

briloff in barrons january 11 1971

chapter 18 a comparison of eight pairs of companies

1 the reader will recall from p 434 above that aaa enterprises tried to
enter this business but quickly failed here graham is making a pro

found and paradoxical observation the more money a company makes
the more likely it is to face new competition since its high returns signal
so clearly that easy money is to be had the new competition in turn will
lead  to  lower  prices  and  smaller  profits  this  crucial  point  was  over
looked by overenthusiastic internet stock buyers who believed that early
winners would sustain their advantage indefinitely

chapter 19 shareholders and managements dividend policy

1 analytical  studies  have  shown  that  in  the  typical  case  a  dollar  paid
out in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar
ket  price  as  had  a  dollar  of  undistributed  earnings  this  point  was
well  illustrated  by  the  publicutility  group  for  a  number  of  years
before  1950  the  lowpayout  issues  sold  at  low  multipliers  of  earn
ings  and  proved  to  be  especially  attractive  buys  because  their  divi
dends were later advanced since 1950 payout rates have been much
more uniform for the industry

chapter 20 margin of safety as the central concept 
of investment

1 this  argument  is  supported  by  paul  hallingby  jr  speculative
opportunities  in  stockpurchase  warrants  analysts journal third
quarter 1947

postscript

1 veracity  requires  the  admission  that  the  deal  almost  fell  through
because the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would
be 100 covered by asset value a future 300 million or more in mar
ket  gain  turned  on  say  50000  of  accounting  items  by  dumb  luck
they got what they insisted on

ground notes   why carnegies advice still matters in 1936 dale carnegie made a compelling statement to his readers dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face this is the foundation of how to win friends and influence people and it is still true today however developing strategies for dealing with people is more complex messaging speed is instantaneous communication media have multiplied networks have expanded beyond borders industries and ideologies yet rather than making the principles in this book obsolete these major changes have made carnegies principles more relevant than ever they represent the foundation of every sound strategy whether you are marketing a brand apologizing to your spouse or pitching to investors and if you do not begin with the right foundation it is easy to send the wrong message to offend or to fall embarrassingly short of your objective precision of communication insisted american writer james thurber is important more important than ever in our era of hairtrigger balances when a false or misunderstood word may create as much disaster as a sudden thoughtless act1 consider the era of hairtrigger balances in which we live today more than fifty years after thurber penned the phrase the stakes are higher amid the amalgam of media distinction is more difficult every word every nonverbal cue every silent stare is scrutinized as it has never been before one wrong move can have far greater implications still every interaction from your first good morning to your last goodnight is an opportunity to win friends and influence others in a positive way those who succeed daily lead quite successful lives but this sort of success comes at a philanthropic price some are not willing to pay it is not as simple as being adwise or savvy about social media the art of communication is the language of leadership said the presidential speechwriter james humes2 in other words people skills that lead to influence have as much to do with the messengera leader in some rightas with the medium this book will show you how and why this is true just as it has shown more than fifty million readers around the globe including world leaders media luminaries business icons and bestselling authors what all come to understand is that there is no such thing as a neutral exchange you leave someone either a little better or a little worse3 the best among us leave others a little better with every nod every inflection every interface this one idea embodied daily has significant results it will improve your relationships and expand your influence with others yes but it will do so because the daily exercise elicits greater character and compassion from you are not we all moved by altruism you can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you carnegies assertion remains relevant albeit counterintuitive because it reminds us the secret to progress with people is a measure of selflessness swept under the drift of the digital age we live in an unprecedented era of selfhelp and selfpromotion we watch youtube videos like the double rainbow go viral in a matter of weeks and garner the sort of global attention people used to break their backs for years even decades to obtain we witness allegedly leaked sex videos create overnight celebrities we watch talking heads and political pundits tear down their competition and elevate their ratings we are daily tempted to believe that the best publicity strategy is a mix of gimmick and parody run through the most virally proficient medium the temptation is too much for many but for those who understand the basics of human relations there is a far better far more reputable far more sustainable way to operate while selfhelp and selfpromotion are not inherently deficient pursuits problems always arise when the stream of selfactualization is dammed within us you are one in seven billionyour progress is not meant for you alone the sooner you allow this truth to shape your communication decisions the sooner you will see that the quickest path to personal or professional growth is not in hyping yourself to others but in sharing yourself with them no author has presented the path as clearly as dale carnegie yet perhaps even he could not have imagined how the path to meaningful collaboration would become an autobahn of lasting lucrative influence today more than clever communication while the hyperfrequency of our interactions has made proficient people skills more advantageous than ever influential people must be more than savvy communicators communication is simply an outward manifestation of our thoughts our intentions and our conclusions about the people around us out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks4 these internal drivers are the primary differentiator between todays leader and todays relational leech the two highest levels of influence are achieved when 1 people follow you because of what you have done for them and 2 people follow you because of who you are in other words the highest levels of influence are reached when generosity and trustworthiness surround your behavior this is the price of great sustainable impact whether two or two million people are involved yet it is only when generosity and trust are communicated artfully and authentically that the benefits are mutual because we live in an age when celebrity influence can be borrowed like credit lines and media coverage can be won by squeaky wheels it is all the more critical that every communication opportunity matterthat every medium you use be filled with messages that build trust convey gratitude and add value to the recipients the one thing that has not changed since carnegies time is that there is still a clear distinction between influence that is borrowed and is difficult to sustain and influence that is earned and is as steady as earths axis carnegie was the master of influence that is earned consider a few of his foundational principlesdont criticize condemn or complain talk about others interests if you are wrong admit it let others save face such principles do not make you a clever conversationalist or a resourceful raconteur they remind you to consider others needs before you speak they encourage you to address difficult subjects honestly and graciously they prod you to become a kinder humbler manager spouse colleague salesperson and parent ultimately they challenge you to gain influence in others lives not through showmanship or manipulation but through a genuine habit of expressing greater respect empathy and grace your reward rich enduring friendships trustworthy transactions compelling leadership and amid todays mass of meisms a very distinguishing trademark the original book has been called the bestselling selfhelp book of all time from a modern standpoint this is a misnomer selfhelp was not a phrase carnegie used it was the moniker assigned to the genre created by the blockbuster success of how to win friends the irony is that carnegie would not endorse all of todays selfhelp advice he extolled action that sprang from genuine interest in others he taught principles that flowed from an underlying delight in helping others succeed were the book recategorized how to win friends would be more appropriately deemed the bestselling soulhelp book in the world for it is the soulish underpinning of the golden rule that carnegie extracted so well the principles herein are more than selfhelp or selfpromotion handles they are soulful strategies for lasting lucrative progress in your conversations your collaborations your company the implications are significant by applying the principles you will not only become a more compelling person with more influence in others lives you will fulfill a philanthropic purpose every day imagine this effect compounded over the dozens of daily interactions the digital age affords you imagine the effect if dozens of people throughout an organization followed suit winning friends and influencing people today is no small matter on the continuum of opportunities it is your greatest and most constant occasion to make sustainable progress with others and what success does not begin with relationships starting soft the business community tends to patronize soft skills as carnegies principles have been called as if to conclude they are complementary to hard skills at best this is backward a permanent paradigm shift is necessary if you want to make the most of your interactions let alone this book soft skills such as compassion and empathy drive hard skills such as programming operations and design to a rare effectiveness how soft skills link hard skills to operational productivity organizational synergy and commercial relevance because all require sound human commitment does the hardskilled manager who sits in lofty obscurity lording over his reports trump the hardskilled manager who walks among his people who is known seen and respected by his people while the former might win some success by forcing his hand for a time his influence is fatally flawed because his power is not bestowed on him by his people his influence is only a veneer of leverage with a short shelf life in his book derailed corporate psychologist tim irwin details the downfall of six highprofile ceos over the last decade every downfall was triggered by the executives inability to connect with employees on a tangible meaningful level in other words every derailment was the result of a hard skill surplus coupled with a soft skill deficitcorporate savvy minus compelling influence and such failings are no less our own theirs were public but ours are often as palpable we lose the faith of friends family members and others when we follow the steps of relational success without feeding the essence of the relationshipsthe measuring and meeting of human needs what makes so many wellmeaning people get this wrong perhaps the ethereal nature of soft skills leads us astray we can lean unilaterally on what is measurable hard skills can be tested taught and transferred most business books are written with this in mind because we can pinpoint hard skill progressindividually and corporatelywith charts metrics and reports not so of soft skills they can be difficult to reduce to steps they are often messy and only crudely quantifiable through better responses and improved relationships yet are not these the best measurements of all what good is a list of accomplishments if they have led to relational regress when any progress is bookended by selfpromotion and selfindulgence it will not last on a small scale do we keep friends whose actions regularly demonstrate the relationship is about them when we learn a persons behavior has an ulterior motive he has less influence with us than someone we have met only once the relationship is doomed unless he confesses and makes a change even then a residue of skepticism will remain on a large scale do we remain loyal to brands that regularly demonstrate either an inability or an unwillingness to embrace our needs and desires gone are the days when the majority of companies tell consumers what they need we live in a day when consumers hold the majority on design manufacturing and marketing decisions going green was once a small wellmeaning ad campaign for a handful of products the collective consumer voice has made it a mandatory marketing mantra individuals and companies insensitive to soft skill success miss the mark today some insist you cannot teach soft skill instincts it is true if you approach soft skills with a hard skill methodology carnegie did not make this mistake he discovered that altruistic instincts rise to the surface not from shrewd stepbystep strategy but from the exercising of core desires when we behave in ways that befriend and positively influence others we tap a deeper well of inspiration meaning and resourcefulness hardwired into all of us is the desire for honest communicationto understand and be understood beyond that for authentic connectionto be known accepted and valued beyond that still for successful collaborationto work together toward meaningful achievement be it commercial success corporate victory or relational longevity the crowning essence of success lies along a spectrum between authentic human connection winning friends and meaningful progressive impact influencing people there is no hope of joy concluded the french aviator and writer antoine de saintexupery except in human relations5 how does one access these soulful skills that power effective communication meaningful connection and progressive collaboration we must first remember that todays relational successes are not measured on the scale of mediawhich ones to use and how many friends fans or followers one can accumulate they are measured on the scale of meaning become meaningful in your interactions and the path to success in any endeavor is simpler and far more sustainable the reason people notice people remember people are moved when their interactions with you always leave them a little better meaning rules the effectiveness of every medium once you have something meaningful to offer you can then choose the most proficient media for your endeavor however when you put the medium before the meaning your message is in danger of becoming in the words of shakespeares macbeth a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing6 the advent of tweets and status updates while providing convenient ways to keep friends family and colleagues in the loop have created an onslaught of such sound and fury but it is not only the messages going out at 140 characters or less that are at risk of signifying nothing any medium carrying a message that lacks meaning will fall short of its intention a television ad a department memo a client email a birthday card with so few media in his day carnegie did not need to thoroughly address both sides of this equation he could focus on how to be meaningful in person on the phone and in letters today we must thoroughly consider both the meanings and the media of our messages straightforward advice for succeeding with people today simple truths wrote the french essayist vauvenargues are a relief from grand speculations7 the reason how to win friends and influence people remains a top seller to this day moving more than 250000 units in the united states alone in 2010 is that the principles within it are simple yet timeless the underlying wisdom is straightforward yet transcendent since the inception of carnegies first course on the subject in 1912 his simple truths have illuminated the most effective ways to become a person others look to for opinions advice and leadership if there is therefore any opportunity in rewriting the classic tome it is not in the context of supplanting its advice the prose threaded through the pages before you is in a different context reframing carnegies advice for a wholly different erathe same timeless principles viewed through a modern lens and applied with digital global mindset the opportunities to win friends and influence people today are exponentially greater than they were in dale carnegies time yet when you break the opportunities down the numbers matter little because the entire universe with one trifling exception is still composed of others8 it is true writes 50 selfhelp classics author tom butlerbowdon of how to win friends that there is a strange inconsistency between the brazenness of the title and much of what is actually in the book9 view this books title through todays skeptical lens and you might miss its magic the book is above all a treatise on applying the unmatched combination of authentic empathy strategic connection and generous leadership it is important to remember that in carnegies time the many media of veneered identities websites facebook linkedin twitter and gimmickladen persuasion popup ads celebrity endorsements televangelism were not around the idea of winning friends had not been reduced to an accept button the idea of influencing people did not include the baggage of a half centurys worth of inflated ad campaigns corporate deception and doubleliving luminaries carnegie had an intuitive reason for identifying his title the way he did back then if you did not foster a friendship influencing a person was nearly impossible social media did not exist digital connections were not available in fact you rarely did business with a person you did not know in a tangible way the average person had only three ways to connect with another facetoface by letter or by telephone facetoface was the expectation today it is the exception while indirect influence via celebrity or social status existed in carnegies time it was neither instant nor viral like it is today friendship was once the bridge to everyday sway you earned friends with the firm shake of a hand a warm smile and an altruistic body of activity you were worthy of the influence that resulted the because and effect are not so tidy today consider the 2010 issue of time magazines 100 most influential people in the world with more than six million twitter followers lady gaga made the list10 there is no need to discuss whether she has influence over her massive fan base which has since climbed over 10 million if she nods to a certain brand of shoes or a certain bottle of water the products move the real discussion surrounds the value she ascribes to her relationships and to what end her influence leads should she seek the highest measure of both her influence is a significant force should she seek only to increase the numbers she will make more money but have no more impact than a crack polaroid campaign the inherent relational value of influence has not changed it is still the currency of interpersonal progress yet the plethora of communication media has made it possible to acquire dimestore versions and you get what you pay for while we live in an era when noise plus naked equals celebrity this is not a book about soliciting friendships and exploiting influence a path carnegie described as originating from the teeth out11 this is a human relations handbook that originates from the heart out it is about winning friends the way your good grandfather won your wise grandmothers heartthrough sincere interest heartfelt empathy and honest appreciation and it is about guiding the lasting influence that arises toward mutual progress and benefit there is a right and effective way to do this and carnegie depicted it superbly seventyfive years later the principles remain true but some definitions have changed and ramifications have expanded the trajectory of this book will thus be toward new explanation and application how do we understand and utilize carnegies principles in a digitized world certain clues can be derived from lists that did not exist in carnegies time such as forbes magazines worlds most admired companies the harvard business reviews bestperforming ceos in the world and times 100 most influential people list already mentioned these clues or at times warnings have served as occasional guides for the context in which interpersonal success is achieved today in the spirit of the original book the pages that follow will also serve as a constant reminder that the reasons we do things are more important than the things we do while the journey to applying carnegie principles today is not as complicated as unplugging and returning to a reliance on telegrams telephones and tangible interface it is also not as trite as injecting a little humanity into every aspect of your digital space in general the best practice is a judicious blend of personal touch and digital presence employing this blend begins with an honest assessment of your current situation from here your path to progress with others is clear what is your ratio of facetoface versus digital interactions for most people email texts blogs tweets and facebook posts are the primary ways they correspond with others this presents new hurdles and new opportunities by relying so heavily on digital communication we lose a critical aspect of human interactions nonverbal cues when delivering bad news it is difficult to show compassion and support without putting your hand on anothers shoulder when explaining a new idea it is difficult to convey the same level of enthusiasm through a phone call as you would if standing before your audience in person how many times have you sent an email and had the recipient call you to clear the air when the air was already clear emotion is difficult to convey without nonverbal cues the advent of video communication has knocked down some barriers but video is only a small fraction of digital communication and still it does not shepherd the highest standard of human dignity the way a facetoface meeting can the awardwinning film up in the air makes this point ryan bingham george clooney is a corporate downsizer flown around the country to fire people for companies who will not do it themselves bingham excels at his job which requires him to lay people off in a dignified even inspiring manner he has mastered a speech in which he encourages each person to embrace the new freedom he even fights against his boss who requires him to begin delivering layoffs via videoconference to decrease expenses the great paradox however is that bingham is a loner without one authentic relationship in his life not even with his baby sister whose wedding he may not attend what appears to be an uncanny ability to empathize and connect with those he is firing is actually a confirmation of profound detachment it is not until a personal experience shows him the raw significance of real human connection that he finally sees the truth then even he cannot follow his advice we live in a driven digital world where the full value of human connection is often traded for transactional proficiency many have mastered the ironic art of increasing touch points while simultaneously losing touch the remedy is found neither in selfpreservation a la ryan bingham nor in stimulating connection through stirring but shallow salesmanship the former is a philosophical blunder the latter is a strategic one there is a threshold to todays productivity found at the very point where progress with people is supplanted by progress often its the sheer speed of communication that affects our judgment because we believe others expect immediate responses as we do ourselves we often do not take the time to craft meaningful responses we ignore the niceties of common courtesy we say i cannot possibly apply these principles to a blog comment to an email at a virtual conference where i am not even sure i can be heard but these interactions are when carnegies principles are most valuable it is in the common everyday moments where altruistic actions most clearly stand out we expect courtesy on first dates and followup meetings we are impacted when the same courtesy shows up in a weekly progress report or a shared ride in the elevator we expect humble eloquence in an ad campaign or a wedding speech we are inspired when the same humble eloquence shows up in an email update or a text reply on a trivial matter the difference as they say is in the detailsthe often subtle details of your daily interactions why do such details still matter in this digital age because the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas to assume leadership and to arouse enthusiasm among peoplethat person is headed for higher earning power it is remarkable how much more relevant carnegies words are today   how to win friends and influence peoplein the digital age   part 1essentials of engagement   1bury your boomerangs ask both adolf hitler and martin luther king jr for a basic definition of influence and you might get similar answers observe their biographical application of influence and you will discover their definitions could not be more at odds the tangible distinction begins with their words pit how fortunate for leaders that men do not think against i am not interested in power for powers sake but    in power that is moral that is right and that is good and the divergence is obvious1 the former maintains influence is the reward of the cunning condescending cynic the latter maintains influence is the reward of the trustworthy agent of the common good every day our words place us somewhere between the two disparate approaches history details the results at either end we communicate toward tearing others down or toward building others up to this end carnegie was succinct in his advice do not criticize condemn or complain but how much more difficult this seems today to say we must be more mindful of our words is an understatement with an immense digital canvas on which to communicate our thoughts comes an equally immense canvas of accountability called public access digital communications have made it possible to reach more people in faster and cheaper ways explained bestselling enchantment author guy kawasaki in a recent interview but a loser is still a loser you could make the case that technology has made it possible to blow ones reputation faster and easier than ever it is a good case indeed and precisely todays counterpoint of applying this principle what was once a covert criticism can now get you fined ask dr patrick michael nesbitt a former canadian family practice physician who was fined 40000 for posting vicious and defamatory remarks on facebook about the mother of his daughter2 or ryan babel the dutch striker of the liverpool football club who following a loss to manchester united tweeted a link to a doctored picture of referee howard webb with the comment and they call him one of the best referees that is a joke he was subsequently fined 10000 about 160003 of babels tweet bbc blogger ben dirs noted whereas a year ago babel might have let off steam to his girlfriend now he has this very convenientand very temptingtool at his fingertips that allows him to sound off to the world4 what was once a careless complaint among friends can now get you fired a 2009 study by proofpoint revealed that of us companies with a thousand or more employees 8 percent reported removing someone for their comments on sites such as facebook and linkedin5 getting more specific a recent online issue of the huffington post describes thirteen facebook posts that got people dismissed from their jobs6 included in the list are  a waitress at a pizza restaurant who posted her complaint and profane criticism of two customers after receiving a small tip for waiting on their table for three hours which included staying an hour past her shift thanks for eating at brixx she snarked and then went on to deride the customers calling them cheap7  a gameday employee at the philadelphia eagles stadium who posted a derogatory status update in which he condemned the team for allowing beloved safety brian dawkins to sign with the denver broncos dan is expletive devastated about dawkins signing with denver    dam eagles r retarted8  seven employees of a canadian grocery store chain called farm boy who created the facebook group i got farm boyd that mocked customers and included verbal attacks against customers and staff9 at times one can wonder whether criticism has become more prevalent than compassion and judgment more prevalent than grace in our communication media there is no disputing that snark is chic with so many opportunities to be heard many seem keen on thrusting forth their right to speak when someone else is wrong yet they just as quickly shrink into their right to remain silent when it is they who are wrong many are accustomed to holding a sword called the first amendment in one hand and a shield called the fifth in the otherall the while forgetting that to do so is to deem human relations a battlefield in many ways this culture of criticism and complaint is the unfortunate reality yet the influential person understands that such indiscretions quicken the path to relational breakdown no matter how right you are or how wrong the other remains such tactics tear down far more often than they build up because they suggest an underlying unilateral motive whether or not it exists they subsequently move an interaction from tame to tense it is no wonder we have more talking heads than true leaders today influence is always at stake but many want nothing more than to state their case not only does it set a poor precedent it does nothing but fuel the tension and increase the gap between a message and meaningful collaboration however when a true leader shows up there is no disputing the converse effect there have been few more compelling communicators than the deliverer of the emancipation proclamation president lincoln was long known as a man who approached tense situations with poise and grace his reaction to a significant tactical error during a climactic moment of the civil war is case in point the battle of gettysburg was fought during the first three days of july 1863 during the night of july 4 general robert e lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain when lee reached the potomac with his defeated army he found a swollen impassable river in front of him and a victorious union army behind him lee was trapped here was the union armys golden opportunity to capture lees army and end the war immediately with a surge of confidence lincoln ordered general george meade not to call a council of war but to attack lee immediately the president telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to meade demanding immediate action meade called a council of war he hesitated he procrastinated he telegraphed all manner of excuses to the president finally the potomac receded and lee crossed the river and escaped with his forces lincoln was furious what does this mean he cried to his son robert great god what does this mean we had them within our grasp and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours yet nothing that i could say or do could make the army move under the circumstances almost any general could have defeated lee if i had gone up there i could have whipped him myself in bitter disappointment a normally restrained lincoln sat down and wrote meade what was given his history a harsh letter my dear general i do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in lees escape he was within our easy grasp and to have closed upon him would in connection with our other late successes have ended the war as it is the war will be prolonged indefinitely if you could not safely attack lee last monday how can you possibly do so south of the river when you can take with you very fewno more than twothirds of the force you then had in hand it would be unreasonable to expect and i do not expect that you can now affect much your golden opportunity is gone and i am distressed immeasurably because of it it was a letter quite justified in being sent yet lincoln never sent it it was found among his papers after his death what do you suppose kept the president from venting his great disappointment and understandable criticism president lincoln was a master communicator and humility was at the heart of all he said he must have considered that if he sent the letter it would have relieved some of his frustration but simultaneously ignited resentment in general meade further impairing the mans usefulness as a commander lincoln knew meade had just been assigned to be commander of the army of the potomac only days before he also knew meade enjoyed a string of heroic successes certainly meade was under a great deal of pressure with the added burden of bad blood between him and some of those he was being asked to command had lincoln brushed such details aside and sent his letter he certainly would have won the battle of words but he would have suffered loss in the war of influence this does not mean general meade did not deserve to be informed of his error it does mean there was an ineffective way to inform him and an effective way lincoln did eventually convey to meade his disappointment but he did so in a dignifying manner in choosing to graciously withhold the more cutting letter lincoln chose to retain and even increase his influence with meade who would go on to be a force for civic good in his hometown of philadelphia until his death in 1872 lincoln seemed to know perhaps more than any other american president in history when to hold his tongue and when silence was a graver mistake than speaking up at the core of this skill was an understanding of one of the most foundational truths of human nature we are selfpreserving creatures who are instinctively compelled to defend deflect and deny all threats to our wellbeing not the least of which are threats to our pride consider the steroids scandal in major league baseball of the list of 129 players linked to steroid and human growth hormone use via positive tests the mitchell report or implications by colleagues only sixteen admitted use10 merely highprofile athletes with highprofile egos not so fast consider the last time a colleague came down on you for something you said or did are we to suppose his words made you want to give the guy a hug and buy him lunch or did you want to hide an open can of sardines in his desk and that is probably being nice neither you nor i enjoy being the subject of disapproval whether or not it is deserved as much as we thirst for approval explained endocrinologist hans selye we dread condemnation when we attempt to use criticism to win an argument to make a point or to incite change we are taking two steps backward people can be led to change as horses can be led to water but deprecation will rarely inspire the results you are aiming for we are not merely speaking of public discourse this is just as true in private conversation despite a zeitgeist of denigrating commentary in blogs talk shows and social media the moment you use a medium to criticize the subject of your criticism is compelled to defend and when another is defensive there is little you can say to break through the barriers he has raised everything you say is then filtered through skepticism or worse complete incredulity in this way critical comments act like invisible boomerangs they return on the throwers head this occurs all the more quickly in a world where nearly everything we communicate is a keystroke mike or phone cam away from international exposure actor mel gibson learned an unfortunate lesson when the profane racially charged condemnation he left on his exgirlfriends voicemail was broadcast to the world his global influence once a significant force out of hollywood took a huge hit a less volatile yet still damaging example occurred in july 2008 when a fox news microphone picked up comments that according to a cnn blog post the reverend jesse jackson meant to deliver privately that seemed to disparage the presumptive democratic nominee for appearing to lecture the black community on morality11 despite jacksons instant public apology his comments put a dent in his national influence on matters important to members of the black community furthermore they placed into question his support of the illinois senator barack obama who would soon become the fortyfourth us president while most of us will avoid such widely publicized communication gaffes before we rest in judgment of public figures who have stumbled we would do ourselves well to consider what others might say should our worst private outburst become public better still to always follow a simple principle in our dealings with othersdont criticize condemn or complain we live in an age where the world can hear our words where global accountability is a very real possibility where our communication catastrophes can follow us indefinitely despite a global trend toward loose talk it is neither wise nor necessary to criticize others to make your messages more effective more important or more newsworthy the degree to which you can be heard today is best thought of not as a burden or blessing but as a responsibility those who accept this responsibility with humility compassion and a trustworthy zeal are much quicker to rise because others remain willing to listen the people most widely respected within industries companies families and groups of friends are those who are clear in their own viewpoints while remaining compassionate with those whose minds or behavior they would like to influence change by force of words is called coercion in some scenarios there is a reason it is a crime and while it might not be illegal between two coworkers colleagues or friends wed do just as well to avoid any sentiment of it the simplest way is to focus on improving yourself instead of others   shift your use of media from a spirit of expose and objection to a spirit of encouragement and exhortation there is nothing wrong with informing your friends and fans even about the things they might want to avoid but the spirit of your information is key are you sharing information because you have an ax to grind this sort of communication is better reserved for the safety of a trusted colleagues couch even if people are already on your side bragging and whining do not bring them closer if anything such behavior makes them question whether they can trust you with their own mistakes and musings  resist badmouthing as a differentiation strategy its longterm effect is far more harmful than helpful in a global economy you never know when your greatest competitor will become your greatest collaborator what will you do when the best road to business growth goes through someone with whom you have already burned the relational bridge competition is healthy and should be respected collaboration is critical and should be protected  make your messages meaningful by removing your agenda whether you are tweeting big news to a large fan base or updating a handful of board members its wise to remember that no one wants a barrage of what is important to you above all the recipients of every bit and byte of your communication want value if all you do is fill their ears inboxes and iphones with descriptions of your latest problem or biggest gripe they will not listen for long there is enough positive communication available to let anothers downbeat dogma fill our minds  calm yourself before communicating to another when you are put off the first five minutes are usually the most volatile if you can train yourself to stuff the kneejerk response you will save yourself hours of backpedaling backscratching and brownnosing down the road while we all have our moments of indiscretion there is little worse than a private indiscretion gone public save yourself the small troubleand potentially extensive dilemmaby taking a step back before spouting something you might come to regret while there is always something to say in appraisal of another it is good to remember that there is always something to be said in appraisal of you too the ancient jewish proverb provides appropriate wisdom here for in the way you judge you will be judged and by your standard of measure it will be measured to you12 and while it is difficult at times to downplay our right to speak freely a quick scan through history will remind you that the greatest influencers are those who held their tongue and swallowed their pride when the tide of negative emotion was arising and instead let brevity humility and wisdom say far more than a critical tirade ever could perhaps there is no more memorable example than the prolific british writer g k chestertons reply to an invitation by the times to write an essay on the subject what is wrong with the world chestertons response dear sirs i amsincerelyg k chesterton13 it is no surprise that a 1943 time review of his book orthodoxy reported that the robust writers most popular antagonist irish playwright george bernard shaw called him a man of colossal genius14 the same review referred to shaw as the friendly enemy of his contemporary even chesterton himself described the uniquely spirited relationship between the two as that of cowboys in a silent movie that was never released15 the men were at odds on most every issue of their day yet the spirit of their relationship never was thanks in large part to chestertons ability to keep his ego in check and respect the opinions of a man who could not have disagreed with him more the result was not uncommon in the writers life chestertons influence reached well beyond perpetually engaging the minds of contemporaries such as bernard shaw oscar wilde and h g wells his book the everlasting man contributed to the christian conversion of c s lewis then an atheist his biography of charles dickens was largely responsible for creating a popular revival and serious scholarly reconsideration of dickenss work his novel the man who was thursday inspired the irish republican leader michael collins with the idea if you did not seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out and his column in the illustrated london news on september 18 1909 had a profound effect on mahatma gandhi16 to win friends and influence others in todays world takes less than clever rhetoric it takes the understated eloquence of grace and selfdeprecation if i am the problem with the world and you are too then we can stop worrying about who is right and get on with the work of making our world better bury your boomerangs and your words will forge a much quicker path to progress   2affirm what is good the academy awardwinning film the kings speech tells the story of how a common man with an uncommon touch helped a stuttering prince become a king who would rally a nation prince albert duke of york had a stammering problem that hindered every part of his life he had trouble telling stories to his children trouble communicating in public speeches and trouble speaking on the radio the latest technology of the day in searching out a cure for his ailment the prince met with an australianborn speech therapist named lionel logue logues methods were unconventional in no small part because he believed stammering was as much a psychological problem as it was a physical one the film shows how the prince known as bertie to his family resists logues entreaties and the rest of the film recounts the rising tension between the men as the stakes are raised and prince albert duke of york becomes king george vi rex imperator and world war looms finally in a breakthrough moment as they prepare for his coronation the soontobe king snaps and let us loose with all of his fearsthat he will fail his nation and become a laughingstock for all of history bertie logue interjects you are the bravest man that i know bertie stops and considers the weight of those words they portend lifechanging impact if emerson was right when he remarked the ancestor of every action is a thought then what logue had done was that most brilliant of influence strategies1 he had introduced a thought that had theretofore never been considered bertie the stammering prince was not weak he was not a loser or a laughingstock the lifetime of teasing he would endured and the very picture he had of himself were not telling the full story there was something in him that was more fundamentally true something that was good    maybe even great bertie embraced it and ultimately he would become a different man because one person had the discernment to affirm in him something others had let his shortcomings obscure2 contrast logues actions with those of dismissed npr executive vice president ron schiller who was caught on video articulating his disparagement of those political parties with which he did not associate the primary difference between the two approaches is ultimately a matter of choice neither bertie nor any political party is without its share of faults it is not as though lionel logue had a more righteous subject with which to deal than did ron schiller both could find reasons to denounce their subjects logue simply took the more influential path the path that held human dignity in the highest regard schiller took a path in which he forgot himself and his fellow humans it is not difficult to see which path is wiser one ancient and powerful jewish parable involves a shepherd guarding one hundred sheep they are under his care and he will not let them down however at roundup one evening he notices one is gone just one ninetynine are safe and secure what does the shepherd do does he say a prayer and hope the sheep shows up before a wolf nabs him no he pens the ninetynine and goes looking that one sheep is of such magnificent importance the shepherd cannot bear to see him left alone3 consider the message this sends to the sheep not just the one but also the other ninetynine who look to the shepherd for provision and protection now consider sending that same message to those you would like to influence have you let them know just how valuable you think they are there is great power in this simple principle embodied regularly we all have an innate unquenchable desire to know we are valued to know we matter yet affirming this in each other is among the most challenging things to do in our day and age how obsessed we can be with the least important most superficial things around weeks of life spent bantering about some celebritys latest style or some athletes latest sin hours observing the sociology of a household of clamoring college students even if we are not caught up in the often maniacal musings of pop culture the demands on our time can still be so intense it seems difficult to dig down deep on anything when we have a torrent of text messages email bins that are overflowing and networks offering ceaseless socializing even that spouse we courted so passionately can become an inconvenience then there are the kids and grandparents and neighbors and so on who has time to affirm the good about anything save perhaps a neighbors new car or kitchen that is quick and painless the problem is that quick and painless can also be mundane and meaningless it is for these reasons that employing this principle matters so much today affirming the good in others should not however be confused with flattery the difference genuine concern a young unkempt college student once asked muhammad ali what he should do with his life he could not decide whether to continue his education or go out into the world to seek his fortune it was clear he was leaning toward the latter stay in college get the education advised ali if they can make penicillin out of moldy bread they can make something out of you4 ali was clearly making light of the situation ultimately he understood what the kid had likely been told his whole life and he used a bit of levity to make a significant point do not give up so easily stay the course despite what you have been told you matter and you can accomplish something great affirmation in contrast to flattery requires seeing someone well enough to sense what to affirm knowing someone well enough to be aware of what really matters flattery is usually an admittance of insensibility a betrayal of trust we say things we think we should say but in reality we are not thinking at all what message does flattery send you do not matter enough for me to pay you much mind we have to overcome the temptation to live on autopilot bestselling author rick warren writes we rush out the door and say hey how are you doing nice to see you we do not even look people in the eye were not really talking to them if you do that you are going to miss a lot of potential in other people    people are not things to be molded like clay that is not your job that is manipulationnot leadership people are not things to be molded they are lives to be unfolded and that is what true leaders do they unfold the lives of others and help them reach their godgiven potential5 it is unreasonable to expect any of us to be on our agame all of the time certainly we all miss opportunities we should have taken but we can all measure our own scales over time do the messages you send with your written words your spoken words your presence tip the scales toward affirmation or aloofness the more they lean toward affirmation the more influence you will gain with others emerson wrote every man is entitled to be valued for his best moments6 think about that for a moment which relationship is most strained in your life right now what would it look like if you began focusing on that persons best moments and sought to affirm them this does not presuppose the person does not have his faults it does not even presume he has fewer faults than fine qualities he might be a broken man with years of waste and wrongdoing in his wake but one thing you can be sure of if you aim to influence him to change repeatedly pointing out his rap sheet will do you little good if instead you begin to remind him of what he could benot with hypothetical hype but with his own history of goodness of success of insight even if only a brief historysomething inside him would have because to awaken he could begin to see what he can still be despite what he has been when we treat man as he is we make him worse than he is when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be we make him what he should be7 few in history have understood the power of affirming the good in others better than the sixteenth president of the united states with this one idea abraham lincoln kept the nation together when he took the oath of office in march 1861 it was far from certain that there would ever be another inaugural address for a us president the same day he was sworn in the stars and bars the confederacys new flag was first raised over montgomery alabama in the months since lincoln had been elected seven states seceded from the union everyone friend and foe alike wanted to know what this man had to say about the breakaway states history now views this as one of the greatest speeches ever given precisely because lincoln wrote with a spirit of reconciliation he was not weakhe warned about the consequences of any attack on the union but he had the vision to affirm what was good at a moment when almost no one else could we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies  what audacity this took seven states had already broken away and declared independence war loomed friends how could they possibly be seen as friends consider the last time a coworker betrayed you a client lied to you or a vendor failed to deliver on a promise was your first reaction to remember what he had done that was still good and true being disappointed let down or betrayed are among our most frustrating maddening moments yet they also afford us rare moments to make a supreme impression do you recall a time someone surprised you with undeserved grace or unconditional forgiveness the occurrence might have taken place many years ago even during your childhood yet the person is likely a permanent part of your memory with the emotion you felt still tangible ultimately gaining influence is about setting yourself apart stepping to a higher plane in the mind and heart of another if all you do is act and react like anyone would you will never be set apart the reasons are simple competition for attention is constant communications are often a blur it is challenging enough to become influential in todays expresslane rat race you need moments to show yourself altruistic and trustworthy and seconds are all you are typically afforded were we all perfect individuals without a shortcoming in our lives gaining influence through differentiation would fall solely on your ability to display a greater measure of trustworthiness than the others in a persons sphere of influence that is a hard line to follow if your competition were all mistakefree individuals like yourself in this scenario competing for influence would look more like a beauty pageant and some still treat it as such that is not the case we are all imperfect beings full of shortcomings and this affords us perhaps as many opportunities to affirm others after disagreement or disappointment as in the midst of affability the key is to allow yourself no claim on circumstantial exemptionsuse a spirit of affirmation to convey your thoughts about others whenever you can lest you make the mistake some do a spirit of affirmation despite anothers faults is not a show of weakness or passivity it is not a denial of justice either for mercy without justice is meaningless lincoln saw beyond the obvious and saw what might happen and he pursued it though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union sometimes affirming the good in others will mean reminding ourselves of that very good that exists in another yes lincoln said things are strained but the bonds of amity are stronger still there was an american history the south and the north both shared they would declared independence together built a nation together endured war together and all needed to be reminded of it when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature those final words are the summation of all that needed to be affirmed there was something bigger than discord hidden deep within a better and truer reality that needed permission to breathe from a british monarch to a divided young nation an appeal to the good in others turned a tense situation into a compelling challenge to change this is not as some might be tempted to think an action that ignores the problems between you and another rather it addresses them headon but in a respectful dignifying manner that is far more successful at propelling another toward repentance reconciliation or improvement in you cannot lead with your feet on the desk ed fuller president and managing director at marriott international asserts no worthwhile business relationship whether with your own people or customers and partners can endure without mutual respect and as i have learned firsthand showing adversaries that you regard them with admiration can resolve even violent conflicts fuller then tells the story of a brawl that broke out between a marriott attorney and a hotel owner in south america when the renegotiation of a management agreement escalated into a shouting match and the two grown men began wrestling in a hotel conference room the struggle continued without the intervention of bystanders until the hotel owners revolver hopped out of its holster and bumped across the floor the wrestlers were immediately pried apart with damaged egos and no resolution a few months passed without progress on the matter until a corporate lawyer and two company executives suggested the marriott president pay the hotel owner a visit fuller describes the events that followed i flew to his hometown and spent two days traveling with him visiting his businesses dining at his club and mingling with his friends as we got to know each other apart from our business dealings our mutual respect grew seeing him in a different light allowed me to understand the strength of his commitment to his employees family and community the differences at the heart of the conflict were not resolved but i realized that he deserved my respect for who he was and what he had accomplished a week after i left we reached an agreement with the owner8 affirming what is good as with every principle in this book is not just for grandly titled people at massive moments in human history it is for this time and this age where the spirit of communication is often less than dignifying from the political podium to the digital medium to the boardroom table the one who speaks in a spirit of respectful unhyperbolic affirmation will always win more friends and influence more people to positive progress than the one who communicates in criticism condemnation and condescension the beauty of this principle today is that our affirmation of others is not limited to tangible interface while nothing can replace the effectiveness of your facetoface interactions explained toms shoes founder blake mycoskie in a recent interview its important to remember that the digital world can enhance relationship building9 at any moment of our day we can spread messages that affirm our friends fans and followers in numerous ways over email twitter text and blogs do not however make the mistake of separating the scalability of a message from the individual significance of the message they are inextricably linked as big as a business gets as large a following as one accumulates messages are still given and received on an individual level what builds a bridge of influence between a king and his speech therapist is the same principle that builds a bridge of influence between a company and its customers or an executive and her reports or a father and his child we are all united by one single desire to be valued by another whether this message is conveyed is not a group decision each individual to whom a message was directedwhether the individual sits alone across a table or in a crowd of three thousanddetermines it in carnegies original book he offered a story that has perhaps more than any other story in its pages struck a chord with millions of readers the world over it was not his story it belonged to a man named w livingston larned who called it father forgets carnegie included it as an encouragement to all of us who can so easily forget ourselves and spend days critiquing and criticizing others it is included here with a different perspectivenot of the father who finally sees his mistakes but of the young son who with an unconditional spirit of affirmation wields a level of influence that changes his father forever listen son i am saying this as you lie asleep one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead i have stolen into your room alone just a few minutes ago as i sat reading my paper in the library a stifling wave of remorse swept over me guiltily i came to your bedside these are the things i was thinking son i had been cross to you i scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel i took you to task for not cleaning your shoes i called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor at breakfast i found fault too you spilled things you gulped down your food you put your elbows on the table you spread butter too thick on your bread and as you started off to play and i made for my train you turned and waved a hand and called goodbye daddy and i frowned and said in reply hold your shoulders back then it began all over again in the late afternoon as i came up the road i spied you down on your knees playing marbles there were holes in your stockings i humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house stockings were expensiveand if you had to buy them you would be more careful imagine that son from a father do you remember later when i was reading in the library how you came in timidly with a sort of hurt look in your eyes when i glanced up over my paper impatient at the interruption you hesitated at the door what is it you want i snapped you said nothing but ran across in one tempestuous plunge and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me and your small arms tightened with an affection that god had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither and then you were gone pattering up the stairs well son it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me what has habit been doing to me the habit of finding fault of reprimandingthis was my reward to you for being a boy it was not that i did not love you it was that i expected too much of youth i was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years and there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character the little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills this was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night nothing else matters tonight son i have come to your bedside in the darkness and i have knelt there ashamed it is a feeble atonement i know you would not understand these things if i told them to you during your waking hours but tomorrow i will be a real daddy i will chum with you and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh i will bite my tongue when impatient words come i will keep saying as if it were a ritual he is nothing but a boya little boy i am afraid i have visualized you as a man yet as i see you now son crumpled and weary in your cot i see that you are still a baby yesterday you were in your mothers arms your head on her shoulder i have asked too much too much is not it profound the influence one is affordedeven the smallest among uswhen affirmation comes clean off our tongue and clear from our hearts all great progress and problem solving with others begins when at least one party is willing to place what is already good on the table from there it is much easier to know where to begin and how to lead the interaction to a mutually beneficial end   3connect with core desires in early 2002 time put an oddlooking computer on its cover it had a small domed base and a jointed shiny chrome neck affixed to a flatscreen monitor that enabled it to be pushed pulled turned lowered or raised with the nudge of a finger it was called the imac and the company introducing it apple computer desperately needed it to work in order to stay in business1 apple had always been the darling of a particular computing nichegenerally creative antiestablishment types but in the article that accompanied the cover story its ceo steve jobs enunciated a brandnew vision for consumers he said he believed the future lay in the pc as the digital hub of camcorders digital cameras mp3 players palm pdas cell phones and dvd players he risked the companys future on a vision of a place where an entire digital life could be consolidated and so with the imac came a free suite of software that today is synonymous with the digital ageitunes iphoto and imovie critics and competitors mocked jobs some of apples longtime rivals called the computer clownish and silly and the vision far too grand the public they embraced the vision and the life that it promised and apple computer now simply apple has seen its share price increase 4856 percent the closest competitor has increased approximately 14 percent why is it because other computer companies would prefer no one buy their products of course notthey all want to be successful they all want to be well liked what they are after is more and more influence in the form of people consuming their products the difference is that steve jobs recognized something dale carnegie championed repeatedly to influence others to act you must first connect to a core desire within them this is a universal truth whether you are dealing with children or clients or calves one day the famous philosopher ralph waldo emerson and his son were trying to get a calf into the barn it was going rather poorly they pushed and the calf pulled they pulled and the calf pushed meanwhile their housemaid noticed their predicament and though she could not write brilliant essays or books she possessed an insight she thought might solve the problem she walked over to the calf and put her finger in its mouth while the calf suckled she gently led it into the barn what did the maid know that the luminous philosopher had forgotten she knew that one of the calfs core desires was food once she tapped into that desire the calf willingly followed emerson and his son merely thought about what they desiredthe calf in the barn so they could eat their lunch but the calf happily grazing in a green pasture had little interest in descending into a dark confined barn that curtailed his dining options that is until the housemaid showed up offered her finger and reminded the calf that some warm milk was in his future it is an excellent metaphor because it reminds us of two key insights we often overlook when trying to influence others 1 influence requires more intuition than intellect the critical contrast between the luminary emerson and his humble housemaid is not one of dissimilar brainpower while emerson was likely the more learned of the two the divergence between them was one of intuition the housemaid had what emerson lacked the public world tends to freely ascribe sway to those in lofty positions that require much education and aptitudethe ceo department chair physician and billionaire we assume such people can move majorities with a whisper and the snap of a finger but as guy kawasaki former chief evangelist at apple pointed out if such a person does not have a deep relationship with people she will not have much influence with them2 the truth is that such stately individuals possess merely aboveaverage conditions to influence while the way in which influence is won remains no different for them than for anyone else influence is no respecter of education or experience it goes only with the one who will set aside his statusbe it high and mighty or low and lowlyand put himself in the place of another to do so takes a shrewd and spontaneous ability to read beneath the surface of an interaction what is essential wrote antoine de saintexupery is invisible to the eye this is an important truth to keep in mind when dealing with those you would like to win over influencing others is not a matter of outsmarting them it is a matter of discerning what they truly want and offering it to them in a mutually beneficial package he knows so little and accomplishes so much robert mcfarlane the third of president reagans six national security advisors once marveled of his boss when reagan left washington more popular than when he first took office writes richard norton smith he accomplished something that had not been done since dwight eisenhower3 how according to president obama reagan recognized the american peoples hunger for accountability and change    he tapped into what people were already feeling4 2 influence requires a gentle hand there were emerson and his son in a fourhanded eightlegged tugofwar with the obstinate calf who was holding his ground it is no way to sway another to your side onto the scene in great contrast strides the housemaid with an index finger extended straight and not hooked no less and the once stubborn calf is suddenly light on its hooves and willingly wrapped around the housemaids pointer lest we forget it is a memorable image of what little moving we have to do to move another to action as a constant reminder former us president dwight eisenhower displayed a paperweight in the oval office that in latin read gently in manner strong in deed5 there is no question of his global influence action springs from what we fundamentally desire author harry overstreet writes in influencing human behavior and the best piece of advice which can be given to wouldbe persuaders whether in business in the home in the school in politics is first arouse in the other person an eager want he who can do this has the whole world with him he who cannot walks a lonely way6 the practice of connecting with core desires is applicable across industry lines and international borders it is as important for the energy executive from holland as it is the executive producer in hollywood the interpersonal efforts that inevitably succeed are those in which the messenger stops dictating and starts discovering what the recipient wants the interpersonal efforts that inevitably fail be they corporate collaboration personal cooperation or artistic rendering are those in which the messenger attempts to tell the recipient what he wants this is perhaps no more evident than in the sales industry an industry of which in a semantic sense we are all part in his book killing the sale bestselling author todd duncan describes the ten fatal mistakes salespeople make one of them he calls arguing and when we fail to connect with anothers core needs we are just as guilty of it whether or not we call selling our profession the mistake of arguing    is staking your sales success on your ability to state your case in convincing fashion its mastering a monologue and then expecting the jury of your prospects to be convinced to take your side but    establishing an initial level of trust takes more than flowery monologue it takes dialogue it takes actual conversation there is no other way for you to know your product or service will meet a persons needs7 he later cites dr theodore zeldin author of conversation who makes the point succinctly real conversation catches fire8 it is mindboggling that despite the millions of branding and marketing dollars spent every year much is still spent on the messengers wants or whimsies rather than the recipients core desires we get an idea in our head for who we want to be or how we want others to perceive our offering and we spend more time shaping and shining that image than we do ascertaining whether the image really matters to those to whom it must matter most individuals and organizations invest more resources in campaigning than in connecting it should be the other way around consider the comparison chart duncan offers juxtaposing what the two forms of interpersonal communication say about you9   dialogue monologue   considerate conceited  authentic fake   transparent manipulative   secure needy   interested in meeting needs interested in making money   builds trust builds tensiona   of course connecting to peoples core desires does not mean the world will be your oyster suffice it to say that without this approach others will remain largely unapproachable their ears will close and their eyes will look elsewhere for something or someone more engaging and their options are endless in the very world steve jobs saw in 2002 fortunately most corporate emails company tweets brand blog entries and commercial ad campaigns are monologues meant to broadcast opinions distinguish brands launch products and construct personas it is precisely because this is so that the person who speaks in a spirit of dialogue and altruistic discovery nabs a significant advantage how do you know if you hold this advantage an honest inventory of your impact is usually enough have your employees really stepped it up or do they remain in a cycle of fits and falters you are confident your marriage is on the upswing but what does your spouse have to say you insist the customers are impressed by your new products does your sales revenue concur you say your brand is sweeping the nation but against what standard are you measuring brand recognition in the seven arts of change author david shaner clarifies the difference between those who truly connect with core desires and those who are merely playing influence the way kids play doctor he writes nearly every study of organizational change over the past two decades indicates that companies fail to make the change they intend approximately seventy percent of the time    before organizational change can succeed it must first occur at the subtle spiritual level in the individuals of the organization    all lasting transformation must begin there because ultimately your spirit and mine is the primary driver of all our behavior10 true change is born of an interpersonal reach that takes hold of the deepest part of an individual shaners explanation is dead on and he should know his company connect consulting has for thirty years helped multinational corporations such as duracell ryobi marc usa and svp worldwide lead successful company change efforts his words remind us that no companywide campaign or individual communication strategy garners influence until it connects with people at their core it is an essential principle in all your efforts to influence others whether your audience is a fiveyearold child or five thousand employees a former us secretary of education once recounted how he did not learn this essential element of engagement until after his first year on the job he felt pretty good about his progress he would ventured out and given speeches and people had applauded and smiled he would attended many dinner parties and sumptuous gatherings and all seemed to go off without a hitch but to what end while home over christmas with time to reflect he came to acknowledge that while he would been highly visible and highly promissory nothing in the department had really changed five thousand employees showed up on time they completed their assigned work they went home there was movement but few if any were moved inside or outside the office walls he wanted to understand why over the first two months of the following year he spent a lot of time with the people who really ran the department of educationthe career civil service workers who pressed forward no matter which political party filled the white house he came to the sobering realization that while he stood on the bridge turning the wheel the wheel was not connected to anything below and since he had no authority to hire or fire from the civil service ranks the only way he could influence positive progress in the department was by winning them over the problem was they would seen politicians come and go they would grown tired and cynical they would given up on deriving inspiration from the top the secretarys wife suggested the way to win them over was by reminding them he was passionate about education and to do so not with new words but with new actions go to schools spend time with kids do retail everyone will notice because these are the things they really care about i do not do retail he huffed i am the secretary of education i do wholesale his wife the daughter of a salesman smiled darling she said if you cannot do retail you will never do wholesale she was right and the secretary knew it for the next year he toured the country rolled up his sleeves read stories listened to teachers and was reminded how much he loved retail education it was a personal victory more significant however was the effect his actions had on his employees their passion was revivedpassion for their daily tasks for better education for more opportunities for more families they were inspired by the secretarys work because his actions had accomplished something the speeches and sumptuous gatherings had not they had tapped a core desire of the tireless department of education workers purpose they wanted to believe again they just needed to be reminded that their work still mattered the secretary offered this reminder and it dramatically turned the tide11 in our rushed world it is easy to forgo the secretarys level of analysis so much of our digital communication is oneway that we come to believe we have limited opportunity to uncover anothers perspective while we communicate with more and more people every day we also become more insular in our approach we are far more inclined to focus on how we can best broadcast our points from our own perspective quickly broadly or both is not this what we witness all around us it is easy to get so caught up in the fray that we forget what we are aiming for connection influence agreement collaboration we can start to believe the battle is won by mere frequency and occasional originalityuseful strategies in the right context but greatly insufficient as your only influence strategies there is a good side however to this constant barrage of onesided broadcasting which spans the spectrum from corporate posturing to celebrity positioning today with a few keystrokes we can better educate ourselves about other peoples perspectives and goals earlier we discussed the dangers of using your digital space to spout off your complaints most of us are more discerning about what we divulge we reveal what matters to us what we think about often what we love and like and hope to see happen soon these tidbytes of information add up to a body of knowledge that offers clues or even clear windows to our core desires this knowledge is invaluable where influence in concerned because like the calf that just wanted more food we only move toward what moves us   part 2six ways to make a lasting impression   1take interest in others interests when it comes to learning the quickest way to win friends shall we turn to the person with the most followers on twitter the blogger with the most diggs the savviest salesperson or the most powerful politician while each can boast of abundant followership and while each will likely offer good advice such people might not be our best role models in fact our best role models might not be people at all perhaps dogs are whether we have stepped outside for two minutes or traveled for two weeks dogs welcome our return as if we were heroes they never demean us or mock us or stand us up for dates they exist to befriend us to orbit around us as the center of their existence are they ever without pure joy just being in our presence dogs are called mans best friend for a reason stories of canine loyalty are the stuff of legend the great poet byron wrote of his dog boatswain he had all the virtues of man and none of his vices1 these are also the stories of our day jon katzs a dog year and john grogans marley  me were nothing if not love stories written by men grieved by their dogs passing dogs know by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in minutes by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in months of trying to get other people interested in you it is more than a furry fourlegged platitude it is a primary principle without which no person can gain real relational traction with another the great irony of human relationsespecially when viewed through the lens of a canineis that our longing for significance in the lives of others should be so simple to meet yet we complicate the matter our biggest struggle is selfishness the single greatest deterrent to amity that we are interested primarily in ourselves is not a phenomenon as new as twitter or facebook it predates friendster and myspace it came before cell phones and email and the internet in the 1930s when carnegie was penning the original manuscript of this book the new york telephone company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out which word was the most frequently used the personal pronoun i was used 3900 times in 500 telephone conversations our selfishness or more politely our selfinterest populates the morals of the great fables icarus swoops and soars into the suns warmth melting the wax on his wings sending him plummeting to the ocean below because hes thinking only of himself ignoring the pleas of his father peter rabbit incurs mr mcgregors wrath by ignoring his mothers commands to stay out of his garden why did adam and eve disobey god in the garden of eden they were thinking only of themselves this selfinterest is not something anyone is likely to change it is a gravitylike reality we are born with innate fightorflight tendencies that is to say our body of words and actions trends toward selfpreservation yet we often forget to consider whom we are really fighting against and to what destination we are fleeing if we are not mindful our selfdefense can turn into selfdetention keeping us from meaningful interaction and in some cases cutting us off from interpersonal progress altogether if we are not mindful the destination to which we flee can become a lonely isolated isle like the city of troy whose walls of great defense became the source of its great demise we can insulate ourselves to the point of interpersonal futility it is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men wrote alfred adler the famous austrian psychotherapist who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others it is from such individuals that all human failures spring that is quite an audacious statement but it is a statement borne out in fact humanitys greatest failures from the killing fields of cambodia to the collapse of lehman brothers are the result of people interested only in themselves damn the collateral damage these are extreme examples but the everyday versions are just as disturbing the general counsel busted for taking a bribe never thought of the shareholders who were counting on that stock for their retirement the pro athlete who took performanceenhancing drugs never considered how his actions would affect his teammates his teams future or the sport he claims to love the husband and father caught in his lie was more interested in preserving a double life than protecting his familys hearts still selfpreservations downfall is about more than catastrophes look back at the quote it is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life adler is simply explaining that a selfcentered life is the most problematic life one can live a life lived in constant interpersonal struggle few true friends shallow shortlived influence this can seem a foreboding principle to embody in an age in which we are rewarded for brooding over and broadcasting our interests far and wide but the ancient maxim is still true for whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted2 our effectiveness with others is ultimately a matter of motive and merchandise why in the end are you communicating and what in the end are you promoting today people are more informed and subsequently more intuitive than ever most of us immediately see through a person whose messaging is only for personal benefit we see gimmicks a mile away we run from underhanded approaches instead we gravitate to what feels real and lasting we embrace those whose messaging offers mutual benefit3 andrew sullivan one of the worlds top political bloggers has considered such matters for more than a decade once the youngestever editor in chief of the venerable new republic sullivan was diagnosed hivpositive in the early 1990s when it was still a death sentence after leaving that post sullivan became one of the internets first big political bloggers with his site hitting more than 300000 unique visitors per month in 2003 one of the things that set sullivan apart from his peers was an intentional interaction with his readership he wanted his blog the daily dish to be about more than politics he wanted loyal readers and he genuinely wanted to know more about the people who followed him he came up with the idea for view from your window in which he asked his readers to submit shots of the world outside their homes as with most things on the internet he had no idea if it would hit i wanted to see their worlds he explained i was giving all of these people all of this access to mine but oneway interactions are ultimately boring4 it was no small gesture and it soon boosted his relationships with readers after the gregarious feature was introduced sullivans work became the centerpiece for the atlantic monthlys online strategy and that sites traffic increased by 30 percent it is no surprise that sullivans robust blog following remained when he moved his blog to newsweek and the daily beast people are attracted to people who care about what interests them the irony of this principletake interest in others interestsis that its effectiveness is predicated on others thinking of themselves its effectiveness essentially requires others being selfinterested there are two things to say about this first selfinterest in its purest form is part of human naturefight or flight is fact this principle does not deny selfinterests existence in all our lives instead it indicates that most people on most days forget the other side of the human equationeveryone else most take selfinterest to the selfcentered end of the spectrum the effectiveness of this principle is therefore tied directly to the infrequency with which most choose to think outside themselves on most days the one who chooses conversely to take interest in others interests on a daily basis is set apart we remember such people befriend them and come to trust them more deeply influence is ultimately an outcropping of trustthe higher the trust the greater the influence second the pinnacle of this principle is not complete selfdenial notice the principle does not read replace your interests with others interests it instead reads take interest in others interests and that is the secret to its application when you incorporate others interests into your ownnot merely for the sake of clarifying your market or ascertaining your audienceyou find that your interests are met in the process of helping others consider bestselling author anne rice who has sold more than 110 million books in her lifetime her career began and achieved sustained success with her famed vampire books including interview with a vampire which was made into a major motion picture while she is a uniquely gifted writer no small part of her success has been her genuine interest in her readers she responds to every bit of her readers mail this meant at one time employing three people fulltime to meet the demand her interest in others has never been feigned for the sake of book sales it seemed to me she explains that people were kind and generous enough to have an interest in me how could i not respond i wanted people to know that i appreciated their letters and i appreciated them5 rice has recently taken to facebook and twitter giving her more direct contact with her fans oh its so wonderful she said were having a conversation about oh so many things6 she calls the community people of the page and wrote recently i think we must remember that facebook and the internet are what we make of them this page has accomplished something extraordinary and perhaps unique it is truly a community infinitely more powerful than the sum of its parts and i thank you for making it what it is for participating here in so many vital and inspiring discussions7 this result is as important for the owner of a business as it is for authors and bloggers in his cult favorite treatise bassackward business business owner steve beecham summarily admits i have never considered myself a brilliant businessman    the country was experiencing one of the great refinance booms of all time and    i jumped in with both feet unfortunately the refinance well dried up before my feet got wet i went six months without a deal and when i did finally close one it was for my brothers home    instead of starting over i set out to find a way to make the business work this is when my fate started to turn8 beecham had already failed in two previous business venturesa retail store and a recycling enterpriseprior to his attempt in the mortgage business he had every reason to pack it up and head back to school or consider letting someone else hold the reins he resisted long enough to see that his approach was wrong from the beginning he was after business when he should have been after relationships he goes on to describe an unexpected encounter in a parking lot with a selfless celebrity that taught him the visceral value of taking interest in others interests before i could get another word in he started asking me questions    where did you grow up what do you do for a living what high school did you go to what are your kids names i left the encounter feeling ten feet tall    in a subtle and unassuming way he would elevated himself in my mind the encounter taught beecham an invaluable lesson from that day forward he committed to asking thoughtful questions of every new person he met and every acquaintance he did not know very well specifically he explains i decided to become a problem solver and a promoter    with no strings attached this is when my business began to not only turn around it began to take off in a matter of months beechams job turned into a lucrative career and soon he became so successful he owned a mortgage company that has since its inception remained at the top of the industry perhaps more significant is that his business has been 100 percent referralbased for a decade he estimates that each day onequarter of the calls his office receives have nothing to do with obtaining a mortgagesomething hes very proud of they are people calling with questions like where should i get my car repaired where should i take my inlaws to dinner and whom should i call for life insurance he explains that these people call him because hes become known as the goto guy in a large local network of friends i did not get that way by holding free mortgage seminars or erecting a large billboard featuring my confident trustworthy face quips beecham i got that way by helping people without hustling them for business it is why thoreau wrote goodness is the only investment that never fails9 the same spirit of relating is within reach of every one of us in every interaction how simple it is to set out motivated only to get to know others and find a problem you can help solve or a pursuit you can help promote this is the simple secret to what beecham calls bassackward business yet the truth is that the typical ways most conduct themselves in business relationships is what is backward ill scratch your back if you scratch minethis is not reciprocity its bartering an entirely different trajectory that removes the magic and its unadulterated magic that makes interactions so memorable its what draws us in there is trust and a genuine sense of belonging and meaning today there is simply no excuse not to take an interest in others interests even if you are not actively involved in clubs groups or local organizations where facetoface interactions are possible there is still an abundance of opportunities to learn about others passions and concerns what could happen if you spent five minutes every day reading through the facebook page of three friends the professional biographies of three clients or the personal blogs of three employees you have not taken the time to know well for starters you would certainly learn something about them you did not know before its also likely you would come to appreciate them more perhaps you have similar interests this is fodder for future conversation even for future collaboration perhaps one is going through a difficult time this is an opportunity to engage them with encouragement and a greater level of empathy perhaps you have a mutual friend would not this make your relationship much easier as trust is already established in a common friend and time is already invested in common experiences one can never underestimate the importance of affinity we tend to dislike what we do not know blogged amy martin founder of social media powerhouse digital royalty and one of forbes magazines 20 bestbranded women on twitter after her first experience with nascar10 many people do not understand or better yet get    the socalled monotonous day of left turns and mullets she was admittedly in that camp before attending the 2011 daytona 500 shortly thereafter she wrote a blog post singing nascars praises for achieving a level of genuine connection and influence with its fan base that is rare in professional sports here is what i learned she writes drivers do fan qas and autograph sessions the day of the race the daytona 500 happens to be the biggest day of the year for nascar i do not think brett favre was chatting it up with thousands of fans the day of the super bowl i received a magical hot pass and could go anywhere it was uncomfortably exciting having unlimited access and at times i worried about getting in the crews way i was a part of the action and was not the only one bottom line fans have access as for why martin believes nascars approach is a smart move for any sport she cites the following reasons  access leads to connection fans are able to sign the actual racetrack  connection leads to relationships at all ages  relationships lead to affinity you cannot fake this affinity  affinity leads to influence there is a reason so many brands are attracted to nascar  influence leads to conversion these fans would likely buy anything this driver is selling martin ends her post with a nod to the potential reach of nascars genuine connectivity with its fan base150000 fans in the stands and 30 million television viewerswere they to embrace the opportunities the digital age affords them there is huge potential she writes when you apply this same access via social media to a larger audience what if the same behindthescenes access available to fans physically at the daytona 500 was available to those billions of potential fans on facebook twitter and youtube who are not watching the race on tv11 martins post bridges the two key points of taking interest in others interests today 1 human relations are always easier when they begin from a place of affinity 2 the potential for relational connectivity is astronomical the bottom line is that you must become genuinely interested in others before you can ever expect anyone to be interested in you all things being equal said author john maxwell in a recent interview people do business with people they like all things not being equal they still do we like people who like us so to be liked you must exhibit admiration for the things others do and say many have argued that people no longer have much interest in others the me focus dominates how we think act and communicate yet you have so many opportunities to stay connected to learn more to show your interest changing how you spend just a small portion of each day can dramatically change how others perceive your level of interest in them changing your customer engagement strategy can dramatically change how the marketplace perceives your company instead of spending each day refining your digital media spend time relating to your friends colleagues and clients post brief admiring notes interact with them and discover what problems you might help solve or what pursuits you might help promote we are all driven by pain and pleasure so such prospects exist in every person when you are sincere in your endeavors to connect with others chances are always higher that meaningful connection will occur progressive mutually beneficial collaboration is then possible and today genuine connection and collaboration can quickly become infectious   2smile getting people to agree about virtually anything is practically impossible take neil armstrongs 1969 romp across the moon in the united kingdom only 75 percent of people believe it actually happened1 only 94 percent of americans believe it happened2 in countries such as mexico china and indonesia fewer than a third of respondents believe al qaeda had anything to do with the 911 attacks in new york city and washington dc in the united states 16 percent of people believe it was planted explosives rather than burning passenger jets that brought down the twin towers of the world trade center3 about half of citizens in the european union believe in god4 there is one thing that does unite us however according to the american academy of cosmetic dentistry 997 percent of adults believe a smile is an important social asset5 its a difficult statistic to refute even if you are not in the business of perfecting smiles we gravitate to grins and giggles consider the alltime most viewed videos on youtube the top two are all about smiles in the most viewed from the united kingdom harry a threeyearold boy and his oneyearold brother charlie are playing for the camera when charlie grabs one of harrys fingers and shoves it in his mouth a moment later he chomps down and harry yelps in displeasure retrieving his finger all the while charlie smiles that smile eventually wins as harrys smile returns and giggles ensue6 the other video is from sweden in it a baby boy smiles giggles and laughs in response to his parents silly sounds it is nearly two minutes of facecrampinducing smiles7 a combined half a billion views tell us all we need to know smiles send a message we like to receive smiling is innate says daniel mcneill author of the face a natural history some sort of smile he writes first appears two to twelve hours after birth no one knows whether these smiles have any contentmcneill suspects they do notbut studies show they are crucial to bonding what no one can debate however is the power of a smile no matter its origin mcneill notes that while courtroom judges are equally likely to find smilers and nonsmilers guilty they give smilers lighter penalties a phenomenon called the smileleniency effect8 smiles also have a proliferation effect nicholas christakis a physician and sociologist at harvard and james fowler a political scientist at the university of california san diego with special expertise in social networks published a paper in the british medical journal in 2008 entitled dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network they knew emotions could spread over short periods of time from person to person in a process known as emotional contagion but what they wanted to know was just how widely and sustainably happiness spread in social networks they followed 4739 people from 1983 to 2003 these individuals were embedded in a larger network of 12067 people each having an average of eleven connections to others including friends family coworkers and neighbors and their happiness was assessed every few years using a standard measure the researchers findings confirmed the impact of a happy person which smiling conveys directly social networks they concluded have clusters of happy and unhappy people within them that reach out to three degrees of separation a persons happiness is related to the happiness of their friends their friends friends and their friends friends friendsthat is to people well beyond their social horizon we found that happy people tend to be located in the center of their social networks and to be located in large clusters of other happy people and we found that each additional happy friend increases a persons probability of being happy by about 9 for comparison having an extra 5000 in income in 1984 dollars increased the probability of being happy by about 2 happiness in short is not merely a function of personal experience but also is a property of groups9 but what of life since 2003 do our more prominent and everpresent digital walls filter out emotions rather than encourage them can happiness still spread in a world of bits and bytes the answer they found is yesif we can see that people are smiling christakis and fowler followed up their first study by looking at a group of 1700 college students interconnected by facebook they reviewed their online profiles determined their closest friends and this time studied everyone is photographs noting those who were smiling in the photos and those who were not they then mapped the pictures based on who was smiling and who was not each student was represented by a node and each line between two nodes indicated that the connected individuals were tagged in a photo together students who are smiling and surrounded by smiling people in their network were colored yellow students who were frowning and surrounded by the same countenance were colored blue and finally green nodes indicated a mix of smiling and nonsmiling friends the map showed in vivid fashion how strongly the yellow nodes smilers and blue nodes frowners clustered together with the yellow clusters proving to be much larger and more populated than the blues additionally the nonsmilers seemed to be located more peripherally in the network primarily on the outskirts of the map this came as no surprise to christakis and fowler who noted statistical analysis of the network shows that people who smile tend to have more friends smiling gets you an average of one extra friend which is pretty good considering that people only have about six close friends not only that but the statistical analyses confirm that those who smile are measurably more central to the network compared to those who do not smile that is if you smile you are less likely to be on the periphery of the online world in their final thoughts after noting the large and frequent number of node clusters surrounding smiling people and the remote and peripherally peppered nodes of frowning people they wrote it thus seems to be the case online as well as offline that when you smile the world smiles with you10 there is a simple reason for this phenomenon when we smile we are letting people know we are happy to be with them happy to meet them happy to be interacting with them they in turn feel happier to be dealing with us to someone who has seen a dozen people frown scowl or turn their faces away your smile is like the sun breaking through the clouds your smile is often the first messenger of your goodwill of course we do not always feel like smiling but if we make the effort we not only make those around us happier but also become happier ourselves you may not be a particularly exuberant outgoing person but a simple smile takes little effortand the rewards can be astonishing for the past decade as email and texting have supplanted oral communication we have been seduced by the fallacious notion that we live in an emotional desert entrepreneurs business owners and many professionals can carry on business with only a minimum of tactile interaction many modern twodimensional media allow all of us at one time or another to forget about the importance of a smile in many ways texts and emails of today are like the telegraph messages of old which had their own share of troubles a reporter once telegraphed actor cary grant about his age how old cary grant the message read the actor replied old cary grant fine how you clearly the human proclivity toward misunderstanding is high throw in technology and it becomes all the more inevitable where telegrams were once ubiquitous todays technology can be suffocating in 1929 at the telegrams peak 200 million of them were sent by april 2010 nearly 300 billion email messages were sent every day11 pile on a daily worldwide barrage of text messages instant messages and facebook wall posts and it is a small wonder the world has not descended into anarchy thank goodness for smiles which can do a better job of clarifying our messages than anythingeven if they take the form of traditional emoticons little faces composed of ordinary keyboard characters designed to give muchneeded context for our communications recognizing the limitations of these symbols the three largest japanese cell phone companiesntt docomo au and softbank mobilecreated emojis color pictures displaying a broad range of emotions and symbols to better emulate the facetoface experience google has now adopted them for its email platform and they are being rapidly integrated into iphones yet while these clever little symbols are endearing they are unlikely to appear within your next digital message to a board member a problem employee or a prospective client emoticons are largely for use in casual conversations and in such contexts they serve well how then do we smile across all media and when necessary maintain a certain level of professionalism in the process there is little doubt that letting another see your smile is most effective but because so many of our interactions today are not facetoface you must turn your resources toward overcoming the obstacles to exhibiting friendliness across digital space it may be simpler than you think outside of emoticons and emojis there is only one medium in which you can convey a digital smileyour voice whether it is written or spoken how you write an email the tone you use and the words you choose are critical tools of friendliness and subsequent influence your written words are like the corners of your mouth they turn up they remain straight or they turn down the subsequent effectwhether the words garner friendships and influencehas much to do with the linear trajectory of the emotion they convey smile through your written words and you convey to others that their wellbeing is important to you you and your message will have the best chance of being received frown through your words and others will often frown on the message and messenger these conclusions certainly do not account for those occasions when a more serious tone ought to be taken still a good rule of thumb here is to make sure the linear thread of the message trends upward always begin and end the message on a positive note rather than on a pessimistic or detached one between two people there is nearly always a reason to smile if you cannot see a reason then perhaps you need to wait before you write or not write at all as many relationships have been damaged by insensitive kneejerk notes as by verbal insults or tirades the reason is simple written words and their effect are permanent and largely irrefutable while you might argue against your emails negative or tactless tone the echoing effect it has on its recipient is nearly impossible to silence and today that effect can multiply quickly damaging relations between employees departments and even entire value chains according to a recent issue of fast company new research is adding a twittery flavor to the old adage birds of a feather flock together because it suggests happy twitterers tend to aggregate the article goes on to explain above many other factors that because people to aggregate together people who are sad or happy tend to communicate on twitter with other people who are sad or happy the research team including university of indiana professor johan bollen analyzed the tweet streams from 102000 twitter users over six months examining 129 million tweets the analysis used standard algorithms borrowed from psychological research to assess the subjective wellbeing of users from their tweets by looking for trends in positive or negative words then they looked at aggregation trends and found that happier people are more usually found retweeting and messaging other twitter users who are also happy the same is true for unhappy people from the findings bollen suggests a tweet is more infectious than we realize and very effectively communicates joy or sadness people who are happy would then tend to prefer on average happier fellow tweeters because they echo their own emotions12 the fact remainsif you cannot convey the proper amount of positive emotion in a written note you are better off leaving the page blank or perhaps even inserting an emoji to the detriment of your professional reputation there are worse things in other words than being thought a bit unprofessional avoiding negative sentiment with your written words altogether is obviously the goal it is largely possible perhaps it is time to rethink the value of those writing skills your teachers insisted would be necessary one day they were right after all the other way in which you convey your digital voice your spoken words has heavy implications as well how you speak the tone in your voice and the words you choose often express more than the words themselves you have no doubt heard the retort your actions speak so loudly i can hardly hear a word you are saying it is just as true to assert your tone speaks so loudly i can hardly hear a word you are saying asserting you are glad to meet someone on a phone call means little if said with minimal facial movement and no positive inflection it simply comes across that you are bored or busy with something more important or worse the complete opposite messagethat meeting the person is an unpleasant proposition avoiding such situations begins in the same way it would begin if you were standing in front of the person numerous studies have shown that the physical act of smiling even while on a phone call actually improves the tone in which your words are conveyed it is no coincidence that one of the central tenets that all speaking singing and broadcasting coaches drill into their students is that your voice sounds more pleasant more inviting and more compelling when you are smiling a smile in other words translates across wires whether or not the person on the receiving end can see your face when seeking influence that leads to positive change there is no sidestepping the door of healthy human relations a smile opens this door whether its visible written or verbal rosalind picard is a professor at the mit media lab and internationally known for her book affective computing about giving technology emotional qualities that help people communicate more effectively the advances she highlights are nothing short of staggeringmachines with faces that can respond appropriately to reprimands or praise encouragement or rebuke13 of course these machines are merely responding to preprogrammed commands much as a computer screen responds when a key is pushed these machines mimic physical cues words and verbal tone yet they do not feel it is worth noting that humans can program such technology this fact alone provides compelling evidence of how well we know pat responses to others cues words and tone we are wired in the same way we wire our technologies only with feeling to boot there are two kinds of people blogged media maven chris brogan those who see the computerinternetbuttons as being attached to human feeling beings and those who think its just online and that it does not attach that is like saying the phone is just something to talk into and there is no emotions there either its not just online people do have feelings that they associate to these at a distance places yes people overreact we agree there but to dismiss emotions simply because of the medium would be to dismiss letters telephones pictures etc lots of things happen at a distance and yet convey consequences i think there are most definitely two sets of minds at work and that by realizing the above it describesdefines a lot of those times when one side or the other feels misunderstood just remembering this one detail and realizing which of the two people you are dealing with and which one others perceive you to be and things might get better14 emotions it seems are the boundless gifts and burdens that humans carry this can either discourage or encourage your mouth has a lot to say about your choice a smile someone once said costs nothing but gives much it enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give it takes but a moment but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever none is so rich or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made rich by it yet a smile cannot be bought begged borrowed or stolen for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away some people are too tired to give you a smile give them one of yours as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give15 smile it increases your face value   3reign with names on march 10 2010 a press release skittered through the wires at quinn emanuel urquhart oliver  hedges one of american lawyers top 100 law firms john quinn and eric emanuel who founded the company twentyfive years earlier were naming a new partnerkathleen m sullivan sullivan one of the nations top litigators and former dean of stanford law school had been credentialed at cornell harvard law and oxford she would been first lady michelle obamas professor at harvard and praise for her legal mind acumen and talent was universal her adversaries knew how tough a legal foe she was her appointment was well deserved law firms like all companies make changes to their businesses from time to time associates come and go paralegals and assistants as well partner turnover is much rarer but it is hardly uncommon why was this particular appointment so significant kathleen sullivan was not just named a partner she became a named partner the new firm would henceforth be called quinn emanuel urquhart  sullivan to be a named partner in a law firm is especially significant all the more at a prestigious firm but what put sullivans appointment into rare air was that she immediately became the first woman ever to be a named partner at one of americas top 100 law firms from 1870 when ada h kepley became the first woman to graduate from a law school to 2010 no other top firm had made space on its door for a womans name but no more a name was embraced and a barrier broken quinn wrote her inclusion in the firms name reflects the integration of our trial and appellate practices and our strengths as a national law firm there is power in a persons name more than a word it is a verbal symbol of something much deeper and more meaningful this is not just the case for groundbreakers such as kathleen sullivan from ancient to modern literature a persons name was not merely a moniker it was a revelation of character personality and fate apollo abraham and atticus cosette scarlett cinderella and pollyanna in roman times a name was so closely identified with who a person was that when a criminals name was removed from the civic register all the rights of citizenship vanished to this day certain tribes in africa believe an individuals given name is the primary force that determines his or her skills decisions and ultimately lifes destiny is there any reason to believe a persons name is any less important today it is perhaps more so but it has become primarily the case in a commercial context this represents opportunities and problems in the digital age names are like company logos identifying not only who one is but also what one representslikes and dislikes yeas and nays the hundreds of millions of bloggers tweeters and facebookers surely want their voices heard but they also want their names known twitter and facebook in particular have done more than simply add to an informationbased economy they have also created a new kind of namebased economy in which we are largely known by the name we brand and campaign to the world this sort of recognition can now be monetized of course giving new

one got tears in his eyes then so did i4 he does not share these personal stories on his blog or in his marketing literature because he believes promising to do something is different from simply producing it saddleback is proud he says to remain a family business despite selling millions of dollars worth of leather goods each year i have heard horror stories of lots of small and successful businesses who driven by greed try to become giants and fail munson writes on his blog we are not like that we are and will maintain our family of leather owners with love pretty much everyday i lay down in bed with my hot wife and we talk about different bag owners who we have been going back and forth with we want to know your name5 it is this level of personal touchputting peoples names before product names and profitsthat makes one surmise saddleback leather will be around as long as one of his leather bags which carries the tagline they will fight over it when you are dead the opportunities to be known by others and to know others are ultimately two sides of the same coin there is brandingthe introduction of you to others and then there is relationship buildingthe interaction between you and others what is interesting is that you can forgo the former and still be successful you can be so good at building relationships that your interactions with others birth and sustain your brand conversely you cannot sustain success on branding alone you cannot brand yourself or your business and then forgo building relationships in the end business is still about one person relating to another mr bates from watkinsville georgia experienced this firsthand he is a business owner who always takes his top outoftown suppliers to bones a famous atlanta restaurant some seventy miles away his loyalty however was not born of their exquisite menu branded as well as any in north america it started with a waiter named james as mr bates and a supplier pulled up to their table one evening james approached promptly hello mr bates he said thank you for choosing bones it is a pleasure to have you back to hear mr bates describe it it was no insignificant moment it changed the dining experience and imprinted that restaurant in my mind id only dined there once beforesix months earlierand james not only knew my name he took the time to discover id been there before i was by no means a regular but the small gesture made me feel like one it was the old adage about treating someone like the person you want him to become coming true for such a small gesture it paid big dividends i do not take my suppliers anywhere else now said mr bates judging by the popularity of bones it would seem many customers share his sentiment this is the primary business payoff of remembering peoples names they remember you the flipside is an unenviable place to be one of the first lessons a politician learns is this to recall a voters name is statesmanship to forget is oblivion it is one trait that unites most of historys great leaders from lincoln to churchill to bonaparte these men figured out ways to remember peoples names with surprising consistency in so doing they recalled knowingly or not a famous emerson saying good manners are made up of petty sacrifices6 when it comes to remembering names some sacrifices may be required napoleon iii emperor of france and nephew of the great napoleon bonaparte claimed he could remember the name of every person he met despite all of his royal duties how if he did not hear the name distinctly he said so sorry i did not get the name clearly then if it was an unusual name he would say how is it spelled during the conversation he took the trouble to repeat the name several times and tried to associate it in his mind with the persons features expression and general appearance if the person was of special importance to him he later wrote the name down on a piece of paper looked at it concentrated on it fixed it securely in his mind and then tore up the paper in this way he gained a visual impression of the name as well as an audible impression7 our challenges today are far greater than napoleons numerous studies show that the only thing worse than television for our attention span is the internet a blur of 140word tweets facebook news feeds emails instant messages and web pages are beginning to rewire our brains in a may 2010 issue of wired author nicholas carr revealed that a professor at the university of california los angeles had discovered that just five hours on the internet rerouted peoples neural pathways carr noted dozens of studies by psychologists neurobiologists and educators point to the same conclusion when we go online we enter an environment that promotes cursory reading hurried and distracted thinking and superficial learning even as the internet grants us easy access to vast amounts of information it is turning us into shallower thinkers literally changing the structure of our brain8 in 2010 famed film critic roger ebert blogged there is such a skitterish impatience in our society right now9 hes right but such reality does not give us an excuse for forgetting peoples names instead it provides us with a challenge as more and more people find it more and more difficult to remember names there is enormous advantage to be gained by those who do how there are some easy ways instead of defaulting to hollow truncated greetings such as hey or hi default to a greeting that uses the persons name dear robin or good morning robert when you do practice napoleons technique and visualize the persons face if you have taken the advice of earlier chapters and sought to take interest in the persons interests impress your mind with those as well robert is married with three daughters and he likes reading ernest hemingway its a simple exercise that will not only help you greet robert by name the next time you interact it will also go a long way to helping you consistently view him outside a mere transactional context a quick tip here before you use peoples names make sure you know them in the right context today most people have more than one name to which they answer celebrated entrepreneur richard branson is richard to many friends but he is also mr branson to many acquaintances and sir richard to many fellow brits while we are a far less formal society at large using a persons name out of context is a good way to get a relationship off on the wrong foot susan or suzie ben or benjamin jacqueline or jackie the best advice is to avoid guessing do not call richard richie rich or dick in an email unless hes been introduced as such hes asked you to use that name or hes referred to himself with that name in a voice mail text message or email to you if you have not been introduced and have never corresponded do a little homework on what people in your same relational position are calling him do not check to see what his facebook or twitter friends call himat this point you are not yet his friend and have not earned the right to call him a more casual name instead review how he refers to himself on his website or blog if there is an article written about him or in which he is referenced use that name we must remember that a person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together remember that name and use it easily and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment but forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage while many choose the safer alternative and address a person with terms such as man madam and sir you can place yourself in the same persons better graces by taking the time to not only remember but also use his or her name many of the salutation pitfalls we fear are easily avoidable with a few minutes worth of research are not a few minutes of your time worth it if it means standing out from the crowd if it means making a better impression than most people make on others if you want others to remember and use your name the small investment is necessary people have names coming at them in all forms all day longpeoples names company names brand names street names and store names what will set yours apart largely the emotions people associate with your name if you are just another waiter in just another restaurant in atlantaa metropolitan area of more than five million peopleyou will be no more memorable than the numbers on your license plate or the color of your shirt your name will do little to trigger emotions that connect others to you it is no coincidence that mr bates easily remembered jamess name after only one encounter he estimates he dines out about twelve times a month when asked if he remembers other waiters names he replied i barely remember my own some days we should always be aware of the magic contained in a persons name and realize that this word is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else it is a persons trademark after the gift of life a persons name is the first gift he or she received when this word is used in conversation the information we are discussing or the connection we are seeking takes on greater meaning perhaps a doctors office provides the best evidence there is an ongoing debate in the medical world about how and when first names should be used does a firstname basis overpersonalize interactions that are best kept in a professional realm or would a firstname basis help in the process of health and healing and particularly in the process of discussing very difficult prognoses it would seem that most doctors believe professionalism is important and first names are best kept at bay yet doctors offices are typically places where patients feel dehumanized they are folders and cases not faces and feelings their names are frequently mispronounced or mistaken altogether only serving to highlight a potentially dangerous disconnection one highprofile doctor decided to buck the trend10 dr howard fine is the head of the neurooncology program at the national institutes of health in that capacity he performs original research oversees and distributes all of nihs funding and is the handson doctor for as many brain cancer patients as want to see himfree of charge since it is a government program when patients arrive to see him for the first time they are largely hopeless they have seen the statistics on the internet they have heard horror stories dr fine views part of his job as restoring hoperesponsible hope how he handles names plays a leading role in this process he estimates hes seen more than twenty thousand patients over the years and one of the ways he has chosen to interact is by introducing himself as howard fine without the doctor designation from there his patients are encouraged to call him by his first name it takes the relationship to another level whereby he is no longer a detached doctor trying to keep them from dying he is a highly educated friend wise confidant and fierce advocate who will fight for their full recovery he is not in the business of blowing smoke instead he understands that because the sharing of facts is both important and poignant for his patients the establishment of rapport is essential for their wellbeing what brain tumor patients need more than a doctor is a trusted advisor who understands this is achieved more naturally when the doctor puts himself on the same level of his patients a fellow human with a strong desire to live it would be easy for a prominent physician to find power in the dr moniker but a big part of what makes fines program the crown jewel of the national institutes of health according to one of the institutes heads is that he recognizes that first names are more powerful and purposeful than detached ranks or bestowed titles it is why carnegie insisted names are the sweetest and most important sound in any language   4listen longer how do you get the job land the client increase your influence and not lose 180 million in market capitalization listen in march 2008 the members of a littleknown indie band from canada were on their way to nebraska to for a weeklong tour the first leg of their united airlines flight landed in chicago as the guys began to deplane they heard a woman behind them exclaim they are throwing guitars out there they pressed their noses up against the windows to see for themselves the woman was right their guitars were being tossed and dropped and tossed again onto the luggage cart one of those guitars a 3500 taylor belonged to the bands lead singer dave carroll who immediately tried telling a flight attendant what was happening on his website he explains she cut him off do not talk to me she said talk to the lead agent outside he went outside where another employee never took the time to listen to his complaint a third employee dismissed him saying but hun that is why we make you sign the waiver he explained that he had not signed a waiver and that no waiver would excuse what many people on the plane had seen she told him to wait until omaha to talk to someone1 not surprisingly when he opened his guitar case he discovered it had been badly damaged thus began a yearlong odyssey in which dave carroll tried to get someone at united airlines to listen during those twelve months every united employee carroll spoke with told him what to do but none bothered to listen to him at one point they told him to bring the guitar to chicago for inspection he had long since returned to his home in canada some fifteen hundred miles away in the meantime carroll had the guitar fixed for 1200 he was a professional musician and needed the primary tool of the trade but the sound was not the same he told united he would settle with them for the repair bill his request fell on deaf ears but a traveling songwriter always has two things something to say and a means to say it if united would not listen perhaps his music audience would2 carroll sat down and wrote a song called united breaks guitars and on july 6 2009 he uploaded a video of it to youtube he hoped for a million views in the first year people listened far more than he anticipated two weeks after it premiered the video had nearly four million views within days the times of london revealed the gathering thunderclouds of bad pr caused united airlines stock price to suffer a midflight stall and it plunged by 10 costing shareholders 180 million which incidentally would have bought carroll more than 51000 replacement guitars3 the power of listening is the power to change hearts and minds more consequentially it is the power of giving people what they most desireto be heard and understood seesmic founder loic le meur maintains that the very idea of online ad campaigns is passe the key for any and every company is a longterm engagement program that facilitates listening to customers4 online ad campaigns have so much promise though they can deliver a demographic profile unlike any other medium your company wants a twentythreeyearold female computer programmer who likes basket weaving there is almost certainly a site where she can be found such profiling has long been the dream of advertisers everywhere how could this not work it does not work le meur says because generating impressions or exposure simply is not how the world works5 rather it works through listening and building up trust this process is a slow one but one that will always bear fruit during the darkest hours of the civil war lincoln wrote to an old friend in springfield illinois asking him to come to washington lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him the old neighbor got to washington as quickly as he could lincoln talked to him for hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing the slaves he went over all the arguments for and against such a move and then read letters and newspaper articles some denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he was going to free them after the long conversation lincoln shook hands with his old friend said goodnight and sent him back to illinois without ever asking for his opinion lincoln had done all of the talking but the talking seemed to clarify his mind he seemed to feel easier after that talk the old friend said lincoln had not wanted advice he had wanted a sympathetic trusted listener to whom he could unburden himself ultimately it is what we all seek at one time or another the question is whether you are discerning enough to be a burden lifter when president coolidge became vice president channing h cox succeeded him as governor of massachusetts and came to washington to call on his predecessor cox was impressed by the fact that coolidge was able to see a long list of callers every day and yet finish his work at 500 pm while cox found that he was often detained at his desk up to nine of the clock how come the difference he asked coolidge you talk back said coolidge6 listenings power like that of smiling is strong when you listen well you not only make an instant impression you also build a solid bridge for lasting connection who can resist being around a person who suspends his thoughts in order to value yours few people in modern times have listened as well as sigmund freud a man who once met him described his manner of listening it struck me so forcibly that i shall never forget him he had qualities which i had never seen in any other man never had i seen such concentrated attention there was none of that piercing soul penetrating gaze business his eyes were mild and genial his voice was low and kind his gestures were few but the attention he gave me his appreciation of what i said even when i said it badly was extraordinary you have no idea what it meant to be listened to like that7 one might argue that people such as freud lincoln and others in an age gone by had it easier their world was smaller and certainly more controlled there is some truth to this argument but not anything that provides us an excuse yes our age is broader and far more untamed but we made it so and it is therefore we who can make such traits work in our favor unfortunately it seems many have not yet figured it out while our circle of influence balloons well beyond our neighbors and work colleagues to encompass primarily through facebook much of our relational history such an expansive network that numbers in the hundreds if not the thousands seems to be overwhelming to most while the number of people to whom we might listen has expanded the number of people to whom we actually listen is diminishing a recent study profiled in the american sociological review reveals that people are growing more socially isolated than they were even twenty years ago overall the number of people americans have in their closest circle of confidants has dropped from around three to about two    whereas nearly threequarters of people in 1985 reported they had a friend in whom they could confide only half in 2004 said they could count on such support the number of people who said they counted a neighbor as a confidant dropped by more than half from about 19 percent to about 8 percent8 were not saying people are completely isolated notes lynn smithlovin a duke university sociologist who helped conduct the study they may have 600 friends on facebook    and email 25 people a day but they are not discussing matters that are personally important9 more so than when this book was first published in 1936 there is a crying need for people who will make the time to listen for people who will resist the skitterish impatience so prevalent in our age and make people more important than progress it is of course absurd to believe progress can be made without the fidelity of other people but we usually do not see this until other people let us knowwith their eyes with their silence with their closed wallets there are few new tips that can create a personal or corporate cache of better listening but there is one principle that if applied daily can reconnect you with others on a lasting level presence a martyred spiritual ambassador once framed the principle this way wherever you are be all there10 john an aspiring political writer understood this principle far earlier in life than his peers his claim is that hes never given a bad job interview for every interview hes received an offer but what is perhaps most interesting is that there has rarely been anything on paper to suggest he was the best fit i have more often than not he admits been an average prospect on paper to what then does he attribute his uncommon interview success rate a counterintuitive perspective on interviews he explains every interview is a chance to learn something new about people i have never met think about it the environment is conducive to it there is already a natural giveandtake in my interviews i have learned about everything from culinary tastes to dashed dreams to crazy hopes people want to be listened to and they want people around who will listen so i listen and i have found that listening imparts a great deal of respectmore so than any planned speech ever could11 so it turns out that listening also garners great respect and johns rare interview presence has translated into rare opportunitieshe has served as both a cia agent and a white house speechwriter when asked for suggestions on embodying his level of presence with others he says his personal goal is to ask fifteen questions per day the most important five he explains are to your family or those in closest proximity to you sure ask about their day but go deeper ask what made them laugh or perhaps what made them cry ask them about a lesson they learned or a person they met whom they liked the next five are for the people with whom you work on a regular basis the old truth that there are no bad questions may or may not be true in a brainstorming session it is certainly true when done with sincerity in a conversation with another person if you ask with respect and interest you cannot go wrong finally he explains the last five questions are for your digital spacefacebook emails twitter and blogs read others posts and messages closely comment or reply with questions and do it for at least five different people every day in addition to that use your posts and updates to ask more questions of your friends and followers you may be surprised at how many people respond these are lessons bob taylor of taylor guitars certainly takes to heart when he heard that dave carrolls taylor guitar had been damaged by united airlines he called carroll directly and offered him two guitars of his choice imagine what might have happened if someone anyone at united exercised an ear for how to make things right with david carroll if they had chances are high they would not have had to issue the following statement when carrolls video went viral this has struck a chord with us we are in conversations with one another to make what happened right and while we mutually agree that this should have been fixed much sooner dave carrolls excellent video provides united with a learning opportunity that we would like to use for training purposes to ensure all customers receive better service from us12 it is often said that you live and learn but perhaps an equally important lesson for us all is that if you listen and learn you live more harmoniously   5discuss what matters to them at a dinner party george bernard shaw sat next to a young man who proved to be a bore of historic proportions after suffering through a seemingly interminable monologue shaw cut in to observe that between the two of them they knew everything there was to know in the world how is that asked the young man well said shaw you seem to know everything except that you are a bore and i know that1 not quite the impression the young man was aiming for but it proves an important point when it comes to mattering to others you must discuss what matters to them assume all else will fall on deaf or in this case dull ears this is an interesting principle to consider given the spirit in which the vast majority of people communicate today most messages are primarily meant to educate others about our lives or our products to reveal compelling portions of ourselves we think others would be attracted to while this appears to be an assertive strategy it is actually a passive strategy in that it requires others to connect with us like a banner ad on a website waiting to be clicked we offer up digital ads of our best selves hoping others will be compelled to engage the trouble is that is marketing monologue not relational dialogue its assumption not assimilation when assumption guides our efforts to befriend or influence others the results end up on the wrong side of memorable in 1810 us general william henry harrison then governor of the indiana territory was negotiating with tecumseh in order to try to prevent open hostilities he ordered a chair to be brought for the native american chief the man who brought it said your father general harrison offers you a seat my father tecumseh exclaimed the sun is my father and the earth is my mother and on her breast i will lie ignoring the chair he stretched himself out on the ground2 todays biggest enemy of lasting influence is the sector of both personal and corporate musing that concerns itself with the art of creating impressions without consulting the science of need ascertainment not only is this method presumptuous but it is a poor business tack what the world needs more ofwhat carnegie espoused seventyfive years agois bridgebuilding dialogue this begins when you flip the modern spirits of marketing and social media on their heads and begin all interactions with a mind for what matters to the other person this starts as we have said with listening once you know what matters to others through a practice of longer listening you can then truly engage them by putting such matters at the forefront of your interactions if you are talking business this process is about putting the customer back into customer relationship managementan endeavor that blogger doc searls once pointed out is more often about management than the customer3 everyone is wrong about influence writes power blogger and business strategist valeria maltoni except your customers think about that before you get into trouble for not delivering meaningful results    true influence flows from drawing together people with shared interests its a process of identifying areas of relevancy among your customers and prospects community building and allowing others to amplify your influence as you meet their needs    you will be chasing the popular kids even those who demur until the cows come home if you keep thinking that influence is about you its not and you do not need the following of a celebrity to build something of significance4 you are ultimately building a community when you initiate interactions with what matters to others and a community is what really matters to you whether you are building a brickandmortar business launching a new brand or planning an important reunion sure there is an initial connection and you need to make it but much of marketing and social media today is only about the connection pointgaining another follower notching another fan claiming another customer often forgotten is the longterm plan businesses call it a customer retention strategy but it is best thought of as a lively meaningful dialogue among a community of friends if the foundation of all longterm success is the establishment of trustbased relationships then the goal of all interactions should be to convey value as soon and as often as possible there are common hurdles to overcome jason travels to senegals most remote regions a few times a year he first traveled with a nonprofit that led him there he returns today because he still learns there recently one of the village elders pulled him aside on a 115degree afternoon to ask him a most urgent question how did people in north america live jason explained that most lived in individual houses somewhat akin to the huts in the village others lived in apartments stacked on top of and next to each other to form bigger buildings and all of these homes the elder inquired they have walls all around yes replied jason but why to keep themselves safe from bad weather and sometimes from bad people and to protect the things in their home and to give privacy oh no no no the elder replied that is backward in their village he explained they had torn down the walls to keep themselves safe you see too many things hide behind walls if we tear down the walls for all to see then we are all safer we live in a modern world and in the modern world we put up walls there are firewalls for our computers mortar walls for our estates and wood and wire fences for our farms and family yards then there is the great wall of diffuse social interaction it can lead to a level of influence that exists outside relationshipan influence founded on followership but not friendship open leadership author and social media maven charlene li warns about the danger of such fortified digital influence in a recent interview she noted the biggest concerna false sense of security there is a difference between a friend and a fan she explained fans have a smaller sense of commitment smaller levels of interest there is a continuum of loyalty whereby fans stand at one end and friends at the other influence occurs across the continuum but it is more certain and lasting on the friends end5 the easiest way to prove lis point is to go online and try to buy a facebook friend it cannot be done companies galore will sell you facebook fans and they can assure you of lots of twitter followers but leave it to social media to shine a bright light on the great truth that no true friend can be bought when are we going to learn that millions of followers does not always equal influence blogged canadian mitch joel author of six pixels of separation and one of the imedia 25 internet marketing leaders and innovators its a game err    business that worked well until the proper analytics and platforms were put in place    smaller stronger groups are where influence lies    the brands that are winning true influence    are winning as opposed to winning because they have people who are having real interactions with other real human beings and those interactions are truly meaningful    it is much more practicalrealistic for businesses to think about using these opportunities to connect and have a sincere engagement instead of trying to rack up their numbers6 newton minow was the influential head of the federal communications commission under president john f kennedy he later went on to serve in various other prestigious public and private sector jobs when asked what his secret was he said that it all came down to his college major he would majored in semanticsthe study of meaning semantics is not simply about words its about the context in which those words are used its about understanding he once remarked that 99 percent of all conflicts are about the misunderstanding of words used in different contexts his success therefore came from trying diligently to understand what someone meant7 the endeavor is all the more significant today because when mark zuckerberg decided to call everyone on facebook friends he made a semantic choice that is easily misunderstood the human brainto say nothing of the human heartcannot process hundreds of friends according to oxford university professor of evolutionary anthropology robin dunbar the size of our brain limits our ability to manage social circles to around 150 friends regardless of our sociability dunbar has looked at facebook and found it to be true online as well the interesting thing is that you can have 1500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world8 but here it is important to introduce dunbar to minow because dunbar defines a friend as someone you care about and contact at least once a year distinctions must be made for while we cannot have 150 intimate friends we can have 150 influential relationships intimate friendships possess deep commitment and are based on great riskfirst comes the risk of believing that we are people who matter enough who are weighty enough to influence others lives if we do not understand the significance of our presence we can never give anyone the present of our lives but an equally great risk is that having intimate friends opens us up to being deeply hurt by those friends some people protect themselves from relational pain by having no intimate friends others do it by having so many shallow friends that a hurt inflicted by one is diffused by the mass the bottom line is that relationship involves risk and if we want to influence other peoples lives we have to be comfortable accepting that risk while the amount we give of ourselves varies based on the relational intimacy we are seeking risk is always implicit in the process of moving people from curious followers to certain friends with whom you have influence that transcends transactional trends once you know what matters to others through a practice of listening placing your matters in a holding pattern is the only way to truly engage others with a steady diet of what they care about and as with most meaningful risks the reward is commensurate subsequent influence is more potent and there soon comes a time when what matters to you matters to them jamie tworkowski understands in 2002 a friend named renee was using the same razor blade to line her cocaine and cut her arms depressed alone and surrounded by friends who were spiraling down with her renee was not long for this world jamie an unassuming surfboard sales rep stepped in and with a group of friends intervened in renees world eschewing emotional risk they tried to give her the gift of presence they bought her coffee and cigarettes they gave her music they surrounded her with love they wondered what it would be like if instead of her cutting a selfloathing fourletter moniker into her arm they could write love on her arms jamies friendship with renee led him to design some tshirts to sell to support the cost of her recovery program his friendship with the lead singer of a popular rock band led him to ask a favor of the front man wear one of our tshirts onstage the musician did nearly a decade later renee is clean and jamies organization to write love on her arms sells nearly 3 million in tshirts a year and invests that money in numerous recovery programs more than 200000 follow jamie on twitter and facebook but he knows most are curious fans and followers a much smaller number are friends such as renee he has some slight influence with those who follow him yet it is shallower than the influence he has with his friends and mostly fleeting he accepts this and celebrates that there are others in the world also doing good things worthy of following he has strong influence with his friends this is the malleable setting in which he chooses to reside it is this placedifferent for everyonewhere you must reside whether you are a multinational corporation or an individual change agent the distinction between your friends and your followers is an important one to consider when seeking to make a lasting impression on others there are those in this world with whom you have earned significant influence they are a gift and a responsibility you should not only know who they are but also always know what matters to them the gift is what they bring to you value it the responsibility is to lead your relationship somewhere meaningful to both of youbut at the very least to them a brands ability to have its message put in front of millions of people begins and ends with that impression concludes mitch joel in his aforementioned blog post we as a public seem to believe that the influence comes from the sheer volume of impressions and connections that we have in the marketplace    it does not true influence comes from connecting to the individuals nurturing those relationships adding real value to the other peoples lives and doing anything and everything to serve them so that when the time comes for you to make an ask there is someone there to lend a hand worry less about how many people you are connected to and worry a whole lot more about who you are connected to who they are and what you are doing to value and honor them9 perhaps what is most meaningful to you after all is being meaningful to others one thing is certain in an age when the mass of messages multiplies daily only a small number really matter to influence others make sure yours are among them   6leave others a little better he called himself mike began blogger and consummate building champions business coach steve scanlon as he relayed a story he loves to share my wife raffa and i were staying a few blocks south of central park and wed hailed his cab to embark on an annual dining tradition in little italy our timing was terrible it was halloween and the already crowded streets were twice full as mike chopped his way through midtown and lower manhattan it was apparent our plans would need to change he suggested greenwich village and we agreed a few minutes later he dropped us at a village curb recommended three restaurants and then rolled back into the crawling mass i thought it was the last wed seen of him1 but as scanlon likes to say with a smile mike thought differently as they enjoyed their meal scanlon reached for the front pocket of his pants he patted here and there and there and here his phone was missing he panicked as he suddenly remembered where it was resignation set in as he imagined the misery of canceling his account losing valuable contact information and buying a new phone he dialed his number from his wifes phone expecting to hear his own recording instead a gentle indian accent answered hulloo who is this scanlon snapped brusquer than intended thees is mike the voice said scanlon took a breath and fumbled through an explanation that ended with them needing to catch a flight home very soon my goodness mike replied your phone is very important i will come as quickly as i can he then coordinated a street corner meeting and promised to hurry scanlon turned to his wife in amazement and relief and explained what was happening when mike pulled to the curb twenty minutes later and delivered the phone scanlon put 80 in the cabbies handall the cash on him he was humbled explained scanlon but i wanted him to know how outstanding the act was he had not mentioned money once turning off his meter and going way out of his way to help an irresponsible customer was extraordinaryid have given him twice the cash if i had it on me this cabbies small act of service made a big impact it turned a nightmare into noteworthy experience scanlon calls what mike did smallpicture thinking it is the foundation of leaving others a little better somewhere along the way we were taught to keep the big picture at the forefront of our minds we learned the benefits of setting big goals making big connections and closing big deals today the most common big picture may be gaining a big following and while such big pictures have value if our minds are focused only on big payoffs we will overlook the small opportunities that make the biggest difference we will miss chances to go a little deeper to connect a little tighter to make others feel that much better about their relationship with us the point explained scanlon is not that bigpicture thinking is bad it is a necessary piece of progressespecially with peoplebut it alone is not enough to reach your big goals many steps come between what we sow and what we reap most are small seeds planted in the small moments of every day consider the sales manager at macys who cast a big vision to double womens shoe sales in june there would be a big summer sale he explained and in combination with a big push in upselling that would turn out big results what resulted unfortunately was no big deal june 1 came and his sales force stopped listening to the customers stories they stopped being sensitive to customers budgets and considerate of their time instead they began fishing for big opportunities to suggest a more expensive shoe or a halfpriced second pair or a matching accessory by months end total sales had decreased by 8 percent what went wrong a typical sales manager might blame his sales team for lack of execution this particular manager pointed the finger at himself what could he have done differently he realized his bigpicture obsession had taken his teams focus off the small actions that would make it a reality it is a common mistake fortunately this particular manager had a second chance a few months later macys was having a labor day sale the sales manager took a different approach he painted the same big picturedouble the previous months salesbut this time he described the small details within the big picture he asked his people to look for every opportunity to serve their customers walk them to the bathroom hold their babies park their strollers behind the counter be mindful of their time commitments and budget constraints instead of focusing on what they were selling the sales team should focus on making their customers days a little better whether or not they bought shoes what do you think happened total sales for september were 40 percent higher than august it was not a doubling of salesa goal even the manager admitted was quite loftybut it was 50 percent better than the same effort in june most important it was progress the difference was in the details the big picture did not change the salespeoples focus did instead of looking for the big sell they sought small meaningful ways to leave people a little better the smaller seeds sown meaningfully reaped a bigger harvest many people make the mistake of equating inspiration with implementation they are like an art teacher who sets his students down in an alpine meadow and asks them to reproduce the glorious landscape the big picture is inspiring long swaying grass white aspens with shimmering golden leaves a brook winding toward the backdrop of snowcapped mountains but merely seeing the picture does not equip the students to skillfully depict one blade of grass on the canvas without instruction in painting each small detail in that big picture their efforts will look nothing like that picturesque meadow before them to become great artists who can replicate the big picture the students must learn to focus on the small particulars nowhere in life is this truer than in human relations who does not have grand plans for certain partnerships collaborative efforts or friendships a marriage proposal is nothing if not a vision for the future of the relationship a collaboration agreement is nothing if not a vision for the future of the business partnership an employment agreement is nothing more than a vision of the great work an employer and employee can accomplish together but is it enough to wax poetic about your love for the woman is it enough to promise great customer service relevant content or valuable support it is said that leonardo da vinci began painting mona lisa in 1503 and did not finish until 1519 some art historians speculate he spent much of that span considering and crafting the enigmatic smile that has been the centerpiece of conversation for five centuries the famous smile now adorns its own 75 million room in the louvre where 6 million visitors pay their respects each year the paintings value is estimated in the ballpark of half a billion us dollars though most claim she is priceless2 what would mona lisa be without its most famous detail a big picture that never realized its potential in the same respect your biggest and best intentionsfor a relationship for your followership for a company or collaborative endeavorwill regularly fall short of their potential if your inspirational intentions do not translate into small acts of service and value most business people treat customer service like an ad campaign said scanlon they post it promise it and promote it but unless they produce it in small increments every day customer service is only lip service it is mona lisa without the smilea nice effort but not that different from anything or anyone else what you must always remember is that what motivates you to win friends is rarely what motivates others to grant you friendship you are motivated by what can be achieved with others loyalty or support or collaborative effort you are motivated by the big picture of connection and collaborationby how things can be in contrast those with whom you want to connect and collaborate see only the small pictures of their own experience with you they see the true measure of your motives in bytes and feats they are motivated by how things are others are constantly asking of you how valuable is my relationship with this person what have you done for me lately still guides the mind of the masses perhaps more so today amid the backdrop of millions of messages and messengers vying for attention this does not suggest as some believe that you must continually outdo yourself or that you must parade as a spectacle it simply means that the secret to all interpersonal progress is adding value and doing so with regularity unfortunately in the digital age winning friends has come to be about marketing about standing out about being significant said legendary peak performance coach tony robbins in a recent interview there are two ways to be significant he explained do something really well or do something really poorly unfortunately infamy is the easiest way to get known today technology gives us the incredible power to connect with learn from and add value to any person on the planet 247 and yet we can burn someone or be foolish and get significance instantly it is unfortunate many people choose that path3 besides the obvious relational consequences of this tack the strategic problem is that there is no shortage of provocative items being broadcast in the digital age between media outlets marketing campaigns and mefirst digital manners your competition on the stage of sustaining interest is colossal and the rewards are famously shallow the real key to winning friends and influencing people today says robbins is moving relationships from manipulative to meaningful the only way you do that is by constantly adding meaning and value this is the scale on which every one of your interactions is judgedevery tweet post email call and tangible encounter to which side does your scale tip in each encountertoward more value or less value to which side does your scale tip over time that is perhaps the more important question because we all make mistakes we have bad days still the fallout of interpersonal failures can be swifter and more merciless than it has ever been before for that reason alone it is wisest to do everything within your powerthrough every medium and every messageto leave others a little better while we certainly have some room for error its more of a laundry room than a grand ballroom how many times has a mere glance put a relationship on the fritz various traditions tell of gods and goddesses of justice themis a titan was an organizer of communal affairs dike was the greek goddess of justice who weighed right and wrong justitia was the roman personification of justice forced to ascend to the heavens because of the wrongdoing of mortals maat was the egyptian goddess who held the universe in order until the moment of creation and then became a heavenly regulator out of these gods and goddesses arose a modern personification of justice the blindfolded swordholding scalebearing image associated with western judicial systems her message could not be simpler truth must be weighed on a casebycase basis for truth to prevail a subtler message is this anything can tip the scales there is not an idle argument or irrelevant fact in a case the scales of justice measure it all what is true in justice holds true in human relationships there are no neutral exchanges you leave someone either a little better or a little worse jordan was assessing his divorce a decade after it occurred on the eve of his second wedding a friend asked why his first one failed it was he said because he neglected the scales every single interaction with his spouse sent her one of two messagesthat she was the most important person in the world to him or that she was not he would sent the latter message far too often it is unrealistic to expect every exchange with every person to be lifealtering but your scale still tips one way or another every day knowing this should give you plenty of reasons to pay attention to every message you send placing this high a priority on altruism would set you apart in this digital age new york times columnist david brooks wrote a column called highfive nation in which he contrasted the humility on display after japans surrender at the end of world war ii with what we see on display today on the day of victory fascism had stood for grandiosity pomposity boasting and zeal the allied propaganda mills had also produced their fair share of polemical excess by 1945 everybody was sick of that there was a mass hunger for a public style that was understated selfabnegating modest and spare4 humility and the sense that others should occupy our minds as much as if not more than we do was part of the culture of that era over time the sentiment began to change writes brooks instead of being humble before god and history moral salvation could be found through intimate contact with oneself    selfexposure and selflove became ways to win shares in the competition for attention5 certainly some people have gained attention todayperhaps notoriety is a better wordby worshipping themselves and creating a culture of celebrity around themselves some make millions off this strategy but what is our impression of such people do they influence others for good perhaps after all the attention they point people to a cultural good which is better than nothing but such people serve primarily as provocateurs like wine before a bland meal they prepare our palate for nothing substantial there is one thing that has not changed over the millenniasomething philosophers from every culture have concluded it is as old as history itself zoroaster taught it to his followers in persia 2500 years ago confucius preached it in china 2400 years ago laotse taught it to his disciples in the valley of the han buddha preached it on the bank of the holy ganges around the same time the sacred books of hinduism taught it 1000 years before that they all concluded do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you two thousand years ago jesus put a slightly different spin on it do to others what you would have them do to you6 it is the only rule in human history we call golden an ironic advantage of our digital age is that many people hold a notion of superiority which affords you a simple way to make a lasting impression show them in some subtle way they are right they are far more likely to return the favor you know why i like you ike winston churchill asked president dwight eisenhower who had labored more or less harmoniously alongside the strong personalities of bernard law montgomery charles de gaulle and franklin d roosevelt because you are not no glory hopper7 always leave people a little better and you might be surprised how big it makes you and how far it takes you   part 3how to merit and maintain others trust   1avoid arguments in their book the preacher and the presidents coauthors nancy gibbs and michael duffy detail the reverend billy grahams path of unlikely ascendance and unmatched influence with not only seven us presidents but also nearly every other global leader in the western world this path they point out was not without its resistance especially early on how graham dealt with one of his staunchest opponents provides a preview of the first principle necessary for winning others trust in february 1954 they write grahams patron henry luce wrote to times man in london the legendary correspondent andre laguerre to prepare him for what was about to come when graham landed in london for a spring crusade this was a time when church membership was much lower in britain between 5 and 15 percent of the population than it was in the united states 59 percent  religion in britain is near death luce noted so billys impact will be worth watching    surely he will be scorned by all the people you know one of those scorners explain gibbs and duffy was a columnist from the daily mirror a man named william connor who called graham hollywoods version of john the baptist as he often did with prominent critics graham suggested they meet in person connor mischievously suggested a rendezvous at a pub called the baptists head as it turned out neither luce laguerre nor connor could estimate the effect graham would have on the city so many people came the first week that from then on he held three meetings at harringay stadium on saturdays    night after night eleven thousand people sat and another thousand stood in rain or sleet or cold to hear him preach his audience included members of parliament an admiral and the navy chief of staff nor could the journalists estimate the effect graham would have on them personallyespecially william connor after meeting the preacher for a chat at the irreverently named pub connor the critic became connor the admirer i never thought he confessed of graham in a subsequent column that friendliness had such a sharp cutting edge i never thought that simplicity could cudgel us sinners so damned hard we live and learn1 while graham could have employed a front of passive aggression by ignoring the cheeky jabs or fought the jabs with pressworthy indignation he chose a higher road a far more effective path he avoided an argument altogether and won his critic over with grace and goodwill arguing with another person will rarely get you anywhere they usually end with each person more firmly convinced of his rightness you may be right dead right but arguing is just as futile as if you were dead wrong humorist dave barry made this point quite well when he said i argue very well ask any of my remaining friends i can win an argument on any topic against any opponent people know this and steer clear of me at parties often as a sign of their great respect they do not even invite me so much of our time online is spent arguing or feeding arguments look no further than comments at the bottom of popular blogs and news sites its nearly always a string of he saidshe said or attempts at oneupmanship beyond that the recent and ongoing corporate and political banter seems to primarily involve proving points and stating cases instead of finding common ground on which to build something of mutual value few of these arguments change peoples minds because the arguments are digitally veiled and lack the clearcut consequences of tangible confrontations both parties can get away with devolving into snarky personal attacks and passive ambiguitythe least effective tools of human relations such was the case when former bp chief executive tony hayward took a hard line of personal selfexoneration and arrogant apathy in reaction to the tragic deepwater horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill that took eleven human lives ravaged the gulf states ecosystem and devastated the livelihood of thousands more workers around the country according to an article in the times he started by refuting scientific findings about the nature and amount of the spill then his contention that the spill was tiny compared to the size of the ocean and that the environmental impact of americas biggest oil spill and of the 950000 gallons of toxic dispersant that have been used to treat it would be very very modest set off a series of gaffes from which he could not recover including a backhanded apology to the people of louisiana in which he stated i would like my life back2 when two days after dodging questions and ditching blame before us lawmakers he was found in cowes on the southern coast of england for a yacht race in which his boat bob was entered it merely highlighted what had already been established whether or not he was right hayward had lost both his credibility and his case in the court of public opinion when influence and impact are at stake it is often the only court that matters3 after his line of argument few could trust the man he seemed to care about two things and two things only himself and his empire under his argumentative approach bp quickly went from suspect to reject regardless of what story the facts would turn out to tell wherever bp was sold to consumers boycotting began why fill up at a bp station when there were a dozen others belonging to companies that did not have fearlessly uncaring leaders trying to argue their way to exoneration some of the chain of reaction was based on perception of course but reality remains perception when the facts are not clear and when the case is in the realm of human relations perception is often so strong that even irrefutable facts are not enough to supplant the wave of bad press that preceded them in haywards defense after his dismissal from bpa day he called one of the saddest of his lifehe was far more empathetic not only about his companys role in the spill but also about his approach to the tragedy friends laud hayward as a kind and generous family man and there is no doubt they have good reason furthermore bp has been a solid respectable company for decades both deserve to be valued for their finest moments no less than any of us would had our argumentative approach with a spouse colleague or client been widely publicized and both hayward and bp still likely will but why not avoid the valleys in the first place we will face conflict nearly every day of our lives so how do we prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument in the end you must value interdependence higher than independence and understand that deferential negotiation is more effective in the long run than a noncompliant crusade one south american leader has proven this principles merit despite great historical and personal odds for a man who came from poverty who led a labor union in a country not known for workers rights who watched his wife die when she was eight months pregnant because they could not afford adequate health care and who formed his own political party one might expect a fighter but luiz inacio lula de silva called lula by all defied expectations at every turn my mother always said two people cannot fight if one person does not want to lula told a reporter once and so lula does not fight an approach that helped him become the president of brazil and hold the position for almost ten years when his newly formed socialist party lost elections year after year he developed an alliance with a rightwing party and courted business leaders despite his social goals when he became president on the promise to prioritize the impoverished in brazil he also built alliances with brazils wealthy and vast upper class by focusing on growing the economy i consider myself a negotiator if we want peace and democracy we have to be tolerant to negotiate more he has said4 lulas tolerance and negotiation helped him achieve astounding things during his time in office through building alliances both domestically and internationally he enacted social programs that pulled more than twenty million people out of poverty and into the middle class while also creating a period of strong economic growth and stability in a country known for the vast divide between the rich and the poor lulas people skills put brazil on course to reverse historical inequalities5 the notion of communication has been greatly misinterpreted explains corporate behavioral specialist esther jeles we have come to believe it is all about the delivery in doing so we regularly forfeit the full potential of our exchanges6 jeles reminds the executives and employees of corporate clients such as twentieth century fox leo burnett and harpo inc that there is an important reason all personal growth techniques spring from the act of listening to your inner wisdom inside us all is a vault of better selfunderstanding higher knowledge and greater ideas she explains tension and conflict occur when youandor those with youdiscard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard how then do we build a practice of avoiding arguments see the singular advantage of operating interdependently this occurs says jeles when you acknowledge that greater interpersonal results are always more probable when your experience and insight are compounded with that of others no matter how expressive or persuasive you might be this does not occur by one person trumping another it occurs when the end result of the tension is a mutual stretching of insight and personal growth and if you can see your interactions clearly despite tension and conflict there is little you cannot accomplish in collaboration with others all of us know how to get attention asserts jeles but few of us know how to get attention and respect at the same time set yourself apart by being one who avoids the arguments that most jump into with both feet   2never say you are wrong the best solution wisest decision and brightest idea nearly always exist outside of what one party brings to the table yet we find it quite easy to declare another person wrong often before we have taken the time to consider what he or she is saying even when we believe another is wrong there is only one way to guarantee an unenviable end to an interaction and all chance of connection or meaningful collaboration and that is to tell the other person we think so those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it those who learn the wrong lessons from the past may be equally doomed writes harvard business school professor and coauthor of negotiation genius deepak malhotra in the opening of a forbescom article comparing the 2011 nfl revenue share dispute with a similar dispute between the owners and players of the national hockey league in 20045 in both disputes the owners concerned about rising costs asked the players to accept a smaller share of league revenues in both disputes the players rejected the owners request and asked to see proof of the rising costs in both disputes the owners initially refused to substantiate their claims in the nhl the situation turned dire because neither would back down accusations of greed were rampant explains malhotra unable to bridge the divide even months after the collective bargaining agreement    had expired the nhl eventually canceled the season two billion dollars in revenues were lost was the result a foregone conclusion according to malhotra it was avoidable if only the sides had understood the basic human relations problem at the heart of the matter both sides lost the season because the owners refused to acknowledge that players had legitimate concerns by seeing them as greedy rather than mistrusting the owners adopted the wrong strategyintransigence rather than transparencyfor too long the dispute fell into the trap of i am right you are wrong because neither would consider the alternative that perhaps both were right there is a critical lesson here negotiations become more productive concludes malhotra when each party acknowledges that the other may have legitimate concerns in the nfl dispute both the owners and the players need to bring a more nuanced perspective to the bargaining tableor fans across america may be doing something other than watching pro football games next fall1 nuance or subtle difference is a critical concept to remember in the midst of disagreement in most disputes our differences with others are far subtler than we allow ourselves to see we so easily treat dissonance like a chasm that cannot be crossedthe only resolution being one party taking a dive or being shoved off the cliff so that only one party remains its far from the truth friendship that insists upon agreement on all matters is not worth the name exhorted mahatma gandhi friendship to be real must ever sustain the weight of honest differences however sharp they be2 the truth is that disagreement is more often a small crack in the sidewalk that can easily be negotiated if we come to the discussion table with a more open mind we talk because we know something explained corporate behavioral specialist esther jeles in a recent interview or we think we know something or in the workplace because there is an expectation that we should know something3 this expectation of knowledge tends to work against us in interactions because it closes off our minds to the possibilities that exist outside the knowledge we bring to the table we enter interactions with corroboration in mind and if that corroboration does not come we spend the remainder of the interaction attempting to either rebut the others assessment or rebuke the others right to make an assessment in the first place the result is that collaborationor the possibility of itis forfeited if that is your approach you will rarely progress far in relationships all effective problem solving collaboration and dispute resolution said jeles begins with an emptying of the mindof what we know or what we think we should know this can feel incredibly unnatural she admitted because we have been trained to demonstrate what we think to show our knowledge our smartswe think therefore we talk yet by approaching a conversation with a blank slate we take a humbler and more honest approach we acknowledge the possibility that we may not know all the facts and that we may not in fact be the only one who is right better yet we create the possibility for meaningful collaborationthe melting of thoughts ideas and experiences into something greater than the sum of two parties the notion that we might not be the only one who is right and that we may in fact also be wrong is of course nearly always the case but we seem so averse to admitting it why is that more often than not it is because we value personal victory over collaborative possibility yet in doing so we not only stunt the relationship we also punt the probability of greater progress than we originally considered we expect too little if in the midst of disagreement we only seek a winner jeles shared the following story from her experience with a wellknown media conglomerate whose swift response to a national disaster caused an aftermath of inhouse conflict her cell rang at midnightit was the president of a media conglomerate that had retained her the man needed jeles to facilitate a meeting first thing in the morning to deal with an assembly line of catastrophes the president was referring to the hurricane katrina tragedy in the wake of one of the united states worst natural disasters his company had swiftly deployed 90 percent of its employees to various regions of the gulf coast no planning no strategy just some general instructions to come back with the important stories now two weeks later the teams had returned to the realities of resuming business in the severely disjointed aftermath i have four production teams fighting about whose coverage should take priority the president explained i have legal fighting with production about waiting for proper vetting and i have accounting fighting with everyone about divvying up the huge expense of the whole thing he paused briefly then went on to tell her how much it had cost six times more than any previous production jeless role said the president was to meet with all the bickering leadership teams and help them talk it out jeles knew precisely what to do the next morning as she sat in the auditorium where the meeting was to be held she watched a familiar sight the executives and their senior staff each entered the auditorium metaphorically carrying a casethe case they would state to win the dispute as they settled into their seats she jumped in with an invitation i would like everyone to take a moment and ask yourself this question what could i have done differently during this assignment that would have helped the other departments succeed in her head jeles says she could hear a series of thuds as the talking heads dropped their verbal cases to the floor ears then perked up around the room as one by one the team leaders shared their in the future we could    thoughts the cfo began by suggesting that his accounting and production teams could lay out a preliminary budget for projects we do not have time the executive vice president of production barked back for sitting around and making budgets when a story is breaking jeles intervened with a question can you see why accounting is suggesting this practice so we do not overspend the executive vice president replied accounting jeles added has an imperative function for the survival of this company equally as important as production she then asked the chief financial officer and the executive vice president of production could your two departments collaborate on creating a preliminary budget for weekly assignments and a breaking news budget with moving caps based on crisis proportions both nodded the mediation moved on the companys chief counsel suggested legal could compose a most common vetting problems document so production would know beforehand how to avoid long vetting processes jeles looked at the executive vice president who was nodding that would be very helpful she agreed done replied the chief counsel the meeting continued in this manner even going so far as to roll out the specifics of suggested items including budgets and documents within thirty minutes everyone in the room was in agreement about the solutions the meeting was formally adjourned and it was then that perhaps the most surprising thing of all happened many executives and their staff stayed behind to capitalize on the collaboration momentum as jeles picked up her bag to leave the president approached in twentyfive years he asserted i have never attended a meeting where there were more people listening than talking in the spirit of all great artisans who begin with only a blank page white canvas or lump of clay we must enter all disputes with a mind open to what more we might discover and produce together only then can our true interpersonal potential be tapped on june 26 2000 in the white houses east room where teddy roosevelt used to box where amy carter had her high school prom and where lewis and clark once camped in their tents president bill clinton announced the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal he remarked4 next to him stood dr francis collins noted geneticist and the head of the human genome project for seven years he had led an international team of more than a thousand scientists in what time journalist j madeleine nash called the challenge of pulling off a technological tour de force that many ranked alongside splitting the atom and landing men on the moon there is only one human genome project and it will happen only once collins said at the time the chance to stand at the helm of that project and put my own personal stamp on it is more than i could imagine 5 that collins had to do it while competing against a former colleague made it all the more interesting in may 1998 five years after collins agreed to helm the project craig venter a passionate nih biologist who was among the countless scientists dedicated to harnessing genomes to cure diseases announced he was founding a company to scoop collinss project by four years the race between collins and venter made for great press central to ongoing commentary were the two mens very different personalitiesone brash one reserved and collins the reserved one had little choice but to compete doing so meant getting scientists from six countries numerous government agencies and many more numerous university labs to work together for a common interest rather than individual glory so it was even more remarkable that in the east room that day francis collins introduced craig venter this way articulate provocative and never complacent he has ushered in a new way of thinking about biology    it is an honor and a pleasure to invite him to tell you about this landmark achievement collins chose a path of cooperation and partnership and resisted the temptation to proclaim venter wrong ultimately he merely saw him as different but different did not have to mean opposed while collins admits the two are different people    wired in a different way times nash points out collins now says that he considers venter to have been a stimulant in a very positive way at the heart of the assertion that others are wrong is actually an unspoken admittance that we do not want to be rejected it is in the spirit of not wanting to be wrong ourselves that we project that role on others if not for a pointed patent leather reminder dale carnegie himself would have fallen prey to this unenviable reaction shortly after the close of world war i he was the business manager for sir ross smith during the war sir ross had been the australian ace out in palestine shortly after peace was declared he astonished the world by flying halfway around it in thirty days no such feat had ever been attempted before it created a tremendous sensation the australian government awarded him fifty thousand dollars the king of england knighted him and for a while he was the talk of the global town carnegie was attending a banquet one night given in sir rosss honor and during the dinner the man sitting next to him told a humorous story that hinged on the quotation there is a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will the raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the bible he was wrong and carnegie knew it positively by his own admission he appointed himself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct the storyteller the other man stuck to his guns from shakespeare absurd that quotation was from the bible and the man knew it frank gammond an old friend of carnegies was seated to his left gammond had devoted years to the study of shakespeare so the storyteller and carnegie agreed to submit the question to the expert mr gammond listened kicked carnegie under the table and then said dale you are wrong the gentleman is right it is from the bible on their way home that night carnegie said to mr gammond frank you knew that quotation was from shakespeare yes of course he replied hamlet act five scene two but we were guests at a festive occasion my dear dale why prove to a man he is wrong is that going to make him like you why not let him save his face he did not ask for your opinion he did not want it always avoid the acute angle it taught carnegie a lesson he never forgot telling people they are wrong will only earn you enemies few people respond logically when they are told they are wrong most respond emotionally and defensively because you are questioning their judgment you should not just avoid the words you are wrong you can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture so you must guard against showing judgment in all of the ways that you communicate and if you are going to prove anything do not let anybody know it it is easy to allow a certain tone to creep into our online communication a tone that tells another person that we believe he or she is wrong sometimes we do not even realize the tone is there until we read what we have written sometime later we believe we are being diplomatic but each word presented in absence of expression or a soft tone of voice is usually a condemnation this is one of the reasons settling disputes is best accomplished in person instead of presenting a truncated argument through email i am or twitter create a more respectful conciliatory environment for conversation then offer your point with an open mind while you in fact might be right and the other person wrong there is no sense in denting a persons ego or permanently damaging a relationship if you remember those who obstinately insisted you were wrong you can be certain others will remember you in that same negative light if you choose to turn an interaction into an opportunity to teach a lesson instead of a chance to strengthen a relationship always default to diplomacy admit that you may be wrong concede that the other person may be right be agreeable ask questions and above all consider the situation from the others perspective and show that person respect such a humble approach leads to unexpected relationships unexpected collaboration and unexpected results   3admit faults quickly and emphatically only slightly less of a cliche than the check is in the mail is this the ref blew the call while the sport and circumstances vary referees regularly make mistakes occasionally the consequences are significant around the world some are so famous they have their own monikers take the hand of god goal for instance in the 1986 world cup quarterfinals argentina and england were locked in a scoreless tie when argentinas captain diego maradona leapt high in the air over goalie peter shilton and punched the ball into the net the referee ali bin nasser did not see the handball and ruled the goal legal then there was jeffrey maier in the 1996 american league championship series the orioles led the yankees 43 in the bottom of the eighth inning when yankees shortstop derek jeter hit a long fly ball into right field the twelveyearold maier reached over the wall and caught the ball preventing orioles right fielder tony tarasco from making the play umpire rich garcia improperly called a home run instead of an out or automatic double the yankees went on to win the game add to these incidents ten thousand other blown calls and fan exasperation at referee errors can be faintly understood certainly we are passionate about our teams but referees are human after all and we can understand making mistakes what makes exasperation linger however is the inability or unwillingness of the referees to admit their mistakes that is what makes one of the worst examples of referee error so extraordinaryand ultimately redeeming its been called the perfect game robbery since 1900the generally recognized start of baseballs modern eranearly four hundred thousand games have been played in the united states during this span only eighteen times has a pitcher delivered perfection retiring every opposing batter in order without giving up a walk or a hit and without his teammates putting a runner on base with an error to put this in perspective the odds of a perfect game being thrown in baseball one in twenty thousand are far smaller than the chance you will be struck by lightning in your lifetime1 but a perfect game is precisely what detroit tigers pitcher armando galarraga had happening one early june evening in 2010 he would recorded twentysix consecutive outs and had gotten the twentyseventh batter to tap a weak ground ball to the first baseman galarraga ran from the mound took the throw from the first baseman tagged the bag ahead of the runner and got ready to celebrate there was only one problem the umpire jim joyce swung his arms wide and shouted safe galarragas perfect game had been lost in one of the most egregious blown calls in sports history but here is where things took an equally unexpected turn it is perhaps the most significant and memorable detail of the story when he got back to the umpires locker room joyce immediately cued the game video and watched the playonly once he saw how badly he would blown the call but instead of letting the dust settle in silence like so many of his colleagues joyce chose a different path he walked straight to the detroit tigers locker room and requested an audience with galarraga face red as a tomato tears in his eyes he hugged galarraga and managed to get out two words before dissolving into tears lo siento he apologized boldly and unreservedly in doing so he changed sports history there had been previous perfect games in baseball but this was the first redemption game there are many things that are common to us allbirth death and a lifetime full of mistakes errors and gaffes we all know this and the vast majority of our mistakes while temporarily frustrating and even maddening to others are forgivable why then do we have such a hard time admitting them take tiger woods for example his thanksgivingnight car crash outside his home quickly triggered seemingly endless accusations and allegations of extramarital affairs where once rumors of affairs would be passed around town as unsubstantiated gossip our digital age can broadcast accuse and convict almost overnight woodss response a prepared vague admission of his transgressions and a request for privacy his professional and personal world soon collapsed around him sponsors dropped him his wife left him and his golf skills suffered greatly could he have taken a different road of course in the first weeks of the breaking news before the fallout of endorsement deals being cancelled or woodss wifes departure pr experts pointed to a different approach that could have stopped the bleeding much sooner in a phoenix business journal article journalist mike sunnucks cited abbie fink of hma public relations fink said woods and his camp chose silence over getting in front of a story that ended up being driven by tmz and the national enquirer in the absence of anything coming from tiger the media will go find the sources elsewhere and after todays news it would appear that there are plenty of people willing to share their side of the story fink said troy corder a principal with critical public relations in phoenix said the woods camp made numerous mistakes including essentially lying hunkering down with a bunker mentality and not being ready to respond to tabloid reports which have been true in part2 a sincere and swift apology publicly made would have brought him to earth in the right sort of way he had been an untouchable icon a quick and emphatic admission not only would have cleared the air but also would have confirmed to people he was like all of us human mistakeprone and messysomething we all knew anyway that would have only helped him return to others good graces much sooner digital royalty ceo amy martin observed at the time tiger should humanize his brand via social media outlets specifically with twitter and realtime raw video his facebook presence has a polished and promotional tonality leaving fans wanting a glimpse behindthescenes    if he had allowed people to see the person behind the superstar personality perceptions and expectations could have been different in recent events3 unfortunately it was not the road tigers team chose after the events that changed the course of his career and the dust took much longer to settle such is the effect of ignoring this principle in the digital age negative news spreads faster than ever if you have made a mistake it is far better that you control the news being spread come clean quickly and convincingly one reason we find it so difficult to admit our faults is that we are inclined to forget the messages that apologies bear this forgetfulness is all the more dangerous today if we admit our faults immediately and emphatically it is like shooting a fullpage press release across the wires that confirms we genuinely care about the people we hurt that we are humbled and that we want to make things right people rarely hold on to anger and disappointment when they can see that we view ourselves and the situation properly we are much more forgiving of those who are willing to come clean right away contrast the publics view today of baseball slugger jason giambi who immediately and tearfully admitted steroid use as the scandal was coming to light against former slugger mark mcgwire who waited five years to clear the air giambi had his life back rather quickly the public was gracious and quick to forgive while mcgwire certainly had his reasons for delaying his explanation in many baseball fans minds he forever wears a scarlet s on his chest a half decade after his stellar career ended he still remained a long way off from receiving the hall of fame induction that was once a foregone conclusion if we are aloof and ambiguous about our mistakes we also shoot out a fullpage press release but one that reads i would like my life back while wed all like our premistake lives back after a mistake has been made we have to remember that no one changed the circumstances but us it is not others duty to give us back the life we took from ourselves only we can get our life back that always begins with admitting our faults quickly and emphatically what all of us at one time or another forget is that there is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit ones errors it not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness but also often helps solve the problem created by the error much quicker ronald reagan was known as the great communicator because to the joy of his supporters and the consternation of his critics he could move from a place of defensive weakness to undeniable strength with a simple quip one of his triedandtrue methods an easy familiarity with the apology during one particularly rocky patch of his presidency he poked fun at his own white house conceding our right hand does not know what our far right hand is doing4 reagan knew it was easier to bear selfcondemnation than condemnation from others if we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow is not it better to beat the other person to the punch when we recognize and admit our errors the response from others is typically forgiveness and generosity quickly the error is diminished in their eyes it is only when we shirk responsibility or refuse to admit our errors immediately that we raise the ire of those around us and the original misjudgment seems to grow in importance and negative effect today we have the opportunity to broadcast our apologies to let everyone involved know we made an error and are sorry for it we nip negative opinions in the bud when we take that action and we gain peoples respect because it takes courage to admit our faults publicly it also takes courage to admit our faults privately consider our families how hard is it for husbands and wives to admit their mistakes to each other its akin to stabbing yourself in the gut but no matter what that mistake may have been it is crucial to choose the path of humility and rely on the power of forgiveness anne was a successful finance executive and mother of three honors graduate of an ivy league school she would never really failed at anything she married the man of her dreams and then one night found herself hanging out with some of her buddies from work while at an outoftown convention one drink led to two and two to four and the group of buddies got smaller until it was just a male coworker and her they decided to leave the bar and in the elevator they kissed a few more floors and footsteps later and they stood outside her hotel room door she opened it they kissed again then they stopped he backed away and so did she each was married they loved their spouses they kissed again and then they stopped and he left and the door closed behind him anne went to bed alone    and then woke up to the nightmare that she would betrayed the man of her dreams she went home two days later and said nothing for six years it was a mistake a onetime mistake with only one witness who was not going to say anything either the years passed with the memory locked away in a mental and emotional safe she knew that if this secret got out it would be the end of her life as the one who had it all together the one who made no mistakes but one evening while on vacation she told her husband everything he looked at her and started crying of all the reactions she would considered that had not been one of them over the next several weeks they talked to each other to their friends and to their pastor her husband grieved and with every minute of his grief her own heart broke but something else broke as wellher mask of perfectionism as friends learned of her mistake she was overwhelmed by the very thing she never considered possiblegrace and forgiveness she discovered that the truth did indeed have the power to set her free annes mistake was not without consequence but in admitting the mistake and seeking forgiveness she allowed room for a different perspective on her life a perspective in which she was safe being imperfect if only she had given herself room six years sooner the same perspective exists for us all if we are brave enough to own it any fool can defend a mistakeand most fools dobut admitting your mistake raises you above the pack and gives you a feeling of exultation at the end of 2010 people in the sports world engaged in that casual endofyear discussion about whom sports illustrated would name as its sportsman of the year the honor ended up going to new orleans saints quarterback drew brees for leading the once hapless saints to their firstever super bowl victory it was a fitting selection but chris harry of aolnewscom believed two different men should have shared the prize instead as far as sheer sportsmanship to me nothing compared to the fallout from the night of june 3 harry goes on to recount the nowfamous story of the blown perfect game and concludes about 16 hours later the tigers and indians played again but the meeting that mattered came before the game when galarraga was tabbed for the trip to home plate to turn in the lineup card joyce was waiting for him the two exchanged handshakes and hugs in one of the most inspiring emotional and moving displays of sportsmanship any sport had ever seen it was a moment worthy of being relived and helped us learn a lesson about invoking class and dignity when circumstances very easilyespecially in this day and agecould have brought about a very different reaction5 oh the power of two words to change everything lo siento i am sorry   4begin in a friendly way successful leaders    are always initiators writes leadership expert john c maxwell in his flagship book the 21 irrefutable laws of leadership he then recalls an instance where beginning in a friendly way was not only necessary but highly recommended still a young man he had been hired to take over the leadership of a troubled church in lancaster ohio where he was told a large and intimidating man named jim butz the elected lay leader of the congregation was the most influential person in the organization he was also told jim had a reputation for maverick behavior that at times had led the church down the wrong path the first thing maxwell did was arrange a meeting with jim in his office it could have been an awkward or even grossly misperceived momenta twentyfiveyearold rookie summoning the sixtyfiveyearold patriarch to meet with himbut maxwell dispelled that notion immediately the second jim sat down maxwell began with a humble acknowledgment of the situation jim was the influencer in the church and maxwell wanted to work with him not against him maxwell then suggested they meet once a week for lunch to talk through the issues and make decisions together while i am the leader here said maxwell ill never take any decision to the people without first discussing it with you i really want to work with you    we can do a lot of great thing together at this church but the decision is yours when he finished maxwell explains jim did not say a word he got up from his seat walked into the hall and stopped to take a drink at the water fountain i followed him out and waited after a long time he stood up straight and turned around    i could see that tears were rolling down his cheeks and then he gave me a great big bear hug and said you can count on me to be on your side1 friendliness begets friendliness we are more inclined to agree with another person or see things from his perspective when we have friendly feelings toward him if in contrast we feel a person is busy or brusque or uninterested in sharing a common courtesy we tend to mirror the sentiment this is a difficult obstacle to overcome whether you have just met the person or have known him awhile where the initiation of interactions is concerned no approach sets the tone more effectively than gentleness and affability even if the other person is a source of pain frustration or anger a friendly greeting says you are worth my time you are valuable this subtle message has tremendous powermore than most realize in the seven arts of change author david shaner shares an incredible experience that taught him the immense power of beginning in a friendly way2 he had been recruited by a longtime friend to teach kiaikido at the aspensnowmass academy of martial arts just up the road from pitkin county a colorado locale made famous in 1970 when american journalist hunter s thompson ran for sheriff on the freak ticket promoting the decriminalization of drugs for personal use turning asphalt streets into grassy meadows banning buildings that obscured the mountain view and renaming aspen fat city to deter investors thompson narrowly lost the election that year but his sentiment set the stage for another less controversial but equally unconventional man to become sheriff his name was dick kienast whose campaign poster had cited sissela boks vision of societal values trust is a social good to be protected just as much as the air we breathe or the water we drink3 kienast believed civility and compassion should rule all law enforcement interaction whether it involved violent felons or frustrated traffic offenders it was a momentous change initiative writes shaner and one that many thought foolish and unnecessary    nevertheless he moved forward in confidence among shaners first kiaikido students at aspensnowmass academy were sheriff kienast and his deputies bob braudis was one of kienasts key deputies and would go on to succeed him as pitkin county sheriff before then deputy braudis would establish his legacy with a compelling display of beginning in a friendly way braudis was an imposing presence and fit the stereotype of a brawny nononsense cop this presence served as a stark and effective contrast to his demeanor with people he never raised his voice even in the midst of volatile situations one event serves as a case in point while deputy braudis was the patrol director a dispatch came through that an armed man was holding all the patrons hostage at a local restaurant called the woody creek tavern braudis was the first to arrive on the scene and from outside the building he was apprised of the situation the mans estranged wife was prohibiting him from visiting his daughter whom he had seen in the restaurant rather than attempting a peaceful greeting something clicked inside the man he yanked out a gun and forced everyone inside to comply with his wishes deputy braudis assessed the danger and took a different tack he peacefully approached the window unarmed sensing the deputys affability the gunman allowed him to enter the building braudis then proceeded to address the man in a civil manner asking him to consider the consequences of his actions which could ultimately lead to him never seeing his daughter again bobs placid demeanor his rational discussion of the real issues and his empathy toward the mans rage validated the suspect writes shaner and the more the man talked with bob the more he realized that much of his anger was with himself he eventually put down his weapon the mans whole demeanor then changed    bob explained that exiting the tavern with cuffs on would put all the law enforcement people outside the tavern at ease so that neither bob nor the suspect would run the risk of being shot the man complied and the conflict was ended peacefully4 consider this story the next time you sit down to write an email to somebody who has made you frustrated or angry will you begin with a civil courteous tone or let your emotions take over and jump into conflict will you take a few moments to inquire about the other persons life or work situation or to create a bond through some shared interest by telling them something about yourself if you begin in a friendly manner you are far more likely to get the positive results you seek especially if you and the other person are currently at odds i do not like that man abraham lincoln once said i must get to know him better5 if you believe building a friendly rapport will be critical to achieving a certain outcome using texts chats or other short forms of communication is not likely to get you very far because of the limited space and the lack of intonation and nonverbal cues to support your sentiment its very difficult to create the level of communication necessary to convey affability if facetoface is not possible at least use a medium that will allow time and space to convey a level of friendliness that in carnegies time ruled human relations it takes creativity and a bit more time to replicate the effect of a warm smile and a firm handshake but it can be done social media requires that business leaders start thinking like smalltown shop owners concurs entrepreneur gary vaynerchuk who wrote the thank you economy this means taking the long view and avoiding shortterm benchmarks to gauge progress    in short business leaders are going to have to relearn the ethics and skills our greatgrandparents generation used in building their own businesses and took for granted    only the companies that can figure out how to mind their manners in a very oldfashioned wayand do it authenticallyare going to have a prayer of competing6 there was an age when people left their houses in their best attire and said hello to all they passed on the way to work when a meeting meant meeting and when a call meant paying someone a visit rather than using the phone while our transactions span the globe today making such tangible connection more infrequent it is still key to treat others in the same spirit you would if they were before you of his growing wine empire vaynerchuk explains we talk to every single individual as though were going to be sitting next to that person at his or her mothers house that night for dinner7 its the proper perspective because it places the burden of accountability squarely where it should beon the messengers shoulders the mistake many make today is placing the burden of accountability on the recipient of the message we use the responses and reactions of others as the only gauge of whether we have taken the right approach or made the right impression this is a slippery slope on two fronts first it can lead to laziness in considering motives role in effective connection if garnering a great response is the only measure of connection then we easily become mere entertainers provocateurs and product pimps who think only about the next great gimmick to grab peoples interest shock value is worth little where true connection is concerned second responses can be deceptive especially in the beginning a tweet may garner many retweets but this does not mean that those relaying your message to others have become fans or even friends they may be thinking of someone else who might benefit from the message or might want to consider the product worse they may have in mind someone who would laugh alongside the retweeter at your lack of knowledge sincerity or tact an online marketing campaign might generate a spike in site traffic or a print media campaign lots of journalistic buzz but wise businesspeople know this does not mean relationships are being formed there is a big difference between engagement and interest interest is piqued in a number of ways many of which are less than genial it often begins and ends on a superficial level because the primary emotions tapped are curiosity surprise or disgust engagement occurs on a deeper level when a persons core values are tapped common to all core values is the notion of being considered worthy of relationship when you engage another in a friendly manner you convey to him he is someone worthy of friendship someone whom you would like to call friend it is for this reason he who sows courtesy reaps friendship8 if you want your voice to reach through the noise and beneath the surface to others motives for moving in your direction begin in a friendly way the first impression that makes is far more memorable than anything the loudest or most provocative attentiongrabber on the planet could come up with years ago when carnegie was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school in northwest missouri he read a fable about the sun and the wind it serves as a vivid reminder of the power of this principle of earning others trust the sun and wind debated about which was the stronger and the wind said ill prove i am see the old man down there with a coat i bet i can get his coat off him quicker than you can so the sun went behind a cloud and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado but the harder it blew the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him finally the wind calmed down and gave up and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man presently the man mopped his brow and pulled off his coat the sun then reminded the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force its a timely lesson in an age that appears to divvy rewards based on greatest volume speed and splash such rewards mean little in the long run because engagement that engenders longevity is continually authenticated on mutual benefit and trust if you do not establish a foundation for both from the beginning through a friendly sentiment both become more difficult to secure with each passing day wait too long or take too many shallow shots at attention and you will be left trying to talk the other into a relationship its never the place you want to bebegging for commitment engagement has to be heartfelt writes vaynerchuk or it will not work    you cannot underestimate peoples ability to spot a soulless bureaucratic tactic a million miles away its a big reason why so many companies that have dipped a toe in social media waters have failed miserably9 winning friends begins with friendliness   5access affinity like friend follow share in the digital age affinity often exists before we share the first hello in carnegies time friendship and commonality walked hand in hand you met you talked you found common ground and with it a fondness that led to deeper friendship today people follow you on twitter or belong to the same facebook group or like your latest video on youtube before you ever meet often there are numerous threads of affinity before you actually meet with the particulars of what we like and dislikedigital buttons and thumbsup includedwe give and are given permission to make agreements and disagreements based solely on affinity we have points of affinity and points of dissonance and more often than not we gravitate and grant influence to those with whom we have the most in common this can be a tremendous boost to building lasting relationships in which influence exists we are not speaking of the law of attraction you can think about having lots of friends with whom you have lots of influence but nothing much will change if you do not take genuine meaningful action to build those relationships we are speaking of what author john c maxwell calls the law of magnetism effective leaders are always on the lookout for good people he writes think about it do you know who you are looking for right now what is your profile of perfect employees what qualities do these people possess do you want them to be aggressive and entrepreneurial are you looking for leaders do you care whether they are in their twenties forties or sixties    now what will determine whether the people you want are the people you get whether they will possess the qualities you desire you may be surprised by the answer believe it or not who you get is not determined by what you want its determined by who you are1 like attracts likein character and commonality today however we can have a head start we can ascertain affinity before we approach a person liking serves in the digital age as a perfect door to influence when someone joins the same facebook group follows your blog or comments on a website he or she is saying yes to you that creates an intensely powerful position to hold if you want to influence that person when a person says no and really means it a physiological cascade of reactions is taking place that is putting the person in a defensive position ready to withdraw but when this same person says yes and really means it he is in a position of acceptance of openness of moving forward so the more yeses you can get at the outset of an interaction even if they have little to do with the ultimate proposal the more likely you are to put the person in a mood to agree with you along the way getting to yes is so much easier if you start with yes we have an obvious opportunitya positive position from which to start dialogue with the vast opportunities available to us to connect with the people who are interested in who we are and what we have to say there is little excuse for starting a relationship or even a conversation on the wrong foot more than that organizations have the power to get their constituents saying yes based purely on the influence of the community microsoft understood this well when it released windows 7 the computer giant had been dealt a blow with the exasperating launch of windows vista a universally derided operating system but it was ready to reenter the fray with windows 7 and it had learned from past experiences it had to get its customers its users onboard right from the start it had to get them saying yes first it had to find its fans the potential influencers in the community of pc users in empowered authors josh bernoff and ted schadler explore microsofts strategy for getting back in the ring to combat the slick macversuspc commercials that depicted the pc as a nerdy inefficient outdated number cruncher it solicited i am a pc videos directly from users via a youtube channel it edited them together to create a powerful beginning to their yesbased marketing campaign when it released a beta version of windows 7 to targeted users it trolled the feedback on blogs twitter facebook discussion forums and other social communities in preparation for the market release it created a moderated feed of the content posted on a host of other sites and platforms and presented the feed on its website facebook page and elsewhere it created advertising featuring users highlighting the concept that windows 7 was designed in part as a result of customer suggestions the tagline i am a pc and windows 7 was my idea the coup de grace though was how it got its fans to celebrate windows 7 and to share it with others it offered an opportunity to its fansit made them feel important if you were a windows 7 fan you could sign up to have a party in your home to show off the new featuresmicrosoft would send along materials    word about the party opportunities spread through social media and before long tens of thousands of people in fourteen countries had signed up microsoft estimates that the parties reached about eight hundred thousand people including hosts and guests2 considering how the release of windows vista had gone pc users could have said no to windows 7 right from the start but microsoft got them to say yes when we start with yes at the most basic level we are creating affinity but to turn affinity into influence there must remain a foundation of empathy we must be able to constantly see the interaction from anothers point of view so that we know the ultimate value of our points of affinity rather than use social media opportunities to help us start from yes and maintain that necessary commitment we often ignore what it is that others want and bombard them with our pitch instead of getting them to say yes yes we force them to say stop stop social media guru chris brogan calls it the blizzard of business rather than a communication snowfall conversations and relationships are based on several touches in the traditional marketing and communication world people would use each touch to ask for something to issue a call to action this is not how social networks work    they are there to give you permission to reach someone who has opted into a relationship with you    its a snowfall every individual flake does not mean a lot but the body of work can change everything3 you have to offer them what they want in your communication if you want to begin and remain at yes only then have you earned a level of trust that permits you to confidently offer others your pitch whether it is for a product service or because of course this principle is equally relevant and required outside of the digital realm a newspaper company had a policy of delivering a new paper to customers who called to complain that their papers had been damaged by inclement weather but over time rising gas prices and fewer subscriptions made it financially impossible to maintain the practice so they sent what they believed to be a very friendly letter to their customers it began something like this dear valued customer we will no longer deliver replacement newspapers when previously delivered newspapers have been damaged by weather they went on to explain the change in policy and then at the very end of the letter they wrote this if you do receive a damaged newspaper please let us know and we will refund the price of the newspaper on your next bill the first response customers might have when reading this letter is irritation and protest by the end of the letter they are too worked up to care that an alternativeand possibly a better oneis being offered what if instead the company had written the letter as follows dear valued customer we recognize how frustrating it can be when the paper you receive is damaged due to the weather yes it is you pay for a product and service and expect quality in both areas yes i do consequently we will now offer a full refund for any paper you receive that has been rendered unreadable because of the weather really great we also wanted to make you aware that like you our business has been affected by rising gas prices consequently we will no longer be able to offer to deliver replacement papers just call us and you will receive a refund instead oh okay at the very least customers might have viewed the actions of the company in a much more favorable light today there are two kinds of agreement we need to keep both in mind where our interactions are concerned the first kind of agreement is the common variety it is the sort that surrounds two parties holding the same opinion on a particular issue the presumption with this kind of agreement is that they were engaged at one time in a dialogue in which they uncovered their harmony of opinion for most of us this sort of dialoguebased agreement is the only kind of agreement we consider but there is another kind of agreement that was far less feasible during carnegies time but has become all the more important today this second kind of agreement is based on two parties liking the same thingor as we might view it being similar people we do not typically call this sort of harmony an agreement but in the digital age it is best to think of it as such because we are always drawn to those with whom we have something in common establishing this commonality or affinity at the outset is a new form of yes the more early yeses you possess the more likely you are to succeed in capturing a yes to your idea solution or transaction access affinity as early and often as possible   6surrender the credit a dale carnegie training student in australia relayed the following story which serves as a good lesson for what can happen when we ignore this principle my business partner and i operated one of the largest it retailers in brisbane we had eight stores employed more than sixty staff members and had a turnover of more than 10m per year although my business partner had helped me a lot and he was a reasonably easygoing person i believed all the success was contributed by me there was only one way to run the company and it was my way when there was a likelihood of an argument i made sure it became an argument and tried to win it regardless of the cost i never began our meetings in friendly fashion and often talked down to him i never considered his feelings and even wondered why he was not more like me in the end i won all the arguments and had my way but i lost the partnership and subsequently the company after i learned this principle i started looking back and now understand how wrong i was i often think if i had known these things sooner how different my business would be today i know i cannot change the past now but i can see the mistakes i made and try to not repeat them today this gentleman is a different person now i always ask my partners about their goals before i set my own he writes then i ask myself what can i do to help this relationship lead to their goals while its easy to see why we want credit for successes for which we labored claiming the credit will never win you friends it will also diminish your influence quicker than just about any other action what is the worst quality in a leader ask the followers and they would tell you it is the quality of taking credit when things go well and dishing out blame when things go wrong few postures send a clearer its all about me message few messages send people scurrying in the other direction faster who wants a friend who thinks its all about them who wants a leader who does not see your contributions the answers to those questions are easy answering the opposite questions is just as easy who wants a friend who does not care who gets the credit who wants a leader who sees the full value of your contribution giving away credit is a magical multiplier writes forbes blogger august turak a former founding employee at mtv it works equally well in business and in our personal lives but harnessing this magic requires an attitude of gratitude without a sincere sense of gratitude sharing credit is just another manipulative trick bound to backfire    none of this is rocket science its common sense so why is credit stolen far more often than shared the usual suspect is fear1 but fear in this case should be reserved for the possibility of becoming a person who is afraid to share the spoils of success turak shares a homily he once heard that makes this point well the sea of galilee is teeming with fish and life the priest began the dead sea is dead and devoid of life they are both fed by the sparkling water of the river jordan so what is the difference the sea of galilee gives all its water away the dead sea keeps it all for itself like the dead sea when we keep all that is fresh and good for ourselves we turn our lives into a briny soup of salty tears surrendering the credit for a job or project cannot be a false humility a covert approach to seeking the spotlight this is a form of the martyr syndrome the principle suggested here is born not of attentionseeking activity but rather of a supreme confidence that you are a far better person when those around you know they play an important role not only in a collaborative success but also in your personal success watch any film or music awards show and you will see this dynamic in action especially in the more magnanimous participants what is the first gesture expected of the winner of an award an acceptance speech and what are acceptance speeches but a list of thankyous to those who were responsible for the winners success some would argue this is merely standard show script but those faces behind the names would have something else to say as the camera swings to show these faces all are beamingsome even crying joyful tears sharing in the success and reciprocating the gratitude it is perhaps no coincidence that greer garson the woman credited with the longest acceptance speech in oscar history at five and a half minutes is also the corecord holder with bette davis for the most consecutive best actress oscar nominations at five could it be that all that gratitude was a big part of the reason she was so successful its often said that to be successful you must surround yourself with successful people while there is truth to the statement few see that there are two ways to approach this positioning either you can seek friendships with those who are already successful or you can seek success for those who are already friends whichever way you choose one thing is certain your success is always commensurate with the number of people who want to see you successful but one way provides better numbers when you seek friendships with those who are successful there is no guarantee they will want success for you too you might have to work to overcome being perceived as a relational leech on the other hand when you seek success for those who are already friends you can just about guarantee that these same people will want success for you surrendering the credit is a way of life you cultivate in your relationships because you are grateful for them and for what they give to you it is nothing more than putting the success and betterment of others firstand putting your confidence in both who you are and in the rubberlike power of reciprocity mark twain certainly possessed the former and henry irving could not accuse him of at least trying to put confidence in the latter there is an amusing anecdote about a conversation between the two literary contemporaries that neatly demonstrates this principle henry irving was telling mark twain a story you have not heard this have you he inquired after the preamble twain assured him he had not a little later irving again paused and asked the same question twain made the same answer irving then got almost to the climax of the tale before breaking off again are you quite sure you have not heard this the third time was too much for the listener i can lie twice for courtesys sake but i draw the line there i cannot lie the third time at any price i not only heard the story i invented it2 twain would have been happy to let the awkward irony pass without a word of the actual truth did it really matter to him that it was his story all along no he was happy to have the story play well for the good of the conversation while twain gave in at the endand who could blame himthe funny story illustrates that it does not matter who gets the credit for a thing so long as that thing benefits all the parties involved inherent in the principle of surrendering the credit to someone else is this word we have already used reciprocity we do not give in order to get in a transactional sense but we do give in order to foster relationshipsand by doing so we know there will be rewards reciprocity is a natural byproduct of a relationship where two people share in joys and pains double the joy half the sorrow goes the saying in true relationships friends look for ways to repay friends what would happen if this spirit of relating spread throughout a company or a particular niche in the marketplace or even across an entire value chain two things are certain 1 everyone involved would enjoy life a lot more and 2 success would be more probable as collaboration occurred naturally we have more power to spread this spirit of relating today than ever in the long run no one but the originator remembers things such as whose idea it was who spoke first or who took the first risk what people remember is magnanimity it is an interesting paradox that the more you surrender the credit for something you have done the more memorable you become and the more you actually end up receiving credit president ronald reagan was once quoted as saying what i would really like to do is to go down in history as the president who made americans believe in themselves again from this quote alone we can establish a fairly accurate character analysis of the man he was in the game so that others could win his political goals centered on the uplifting and success of those he served in the office of president perhaps what best typifies reagan is the quote on the plaque that sat above his oval office desk it read there is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he does not mind who gets the credit3 so often this is the case for influential people they pursue a higher calling something that transcends whatever political bureaucratic or successoriented motivations stifle others reagan dismissed comments about his legacy with the quip that he would not be around to hear what the scholars and historians would say of him this is what endeared him to so many as a person and leader he lived and led with a constant surrender to the greater good of a country and did so with starkly unconventional methods this is the mark of a person who seeks to elevate others despite himself it is the unconventional mind that understands success is not about attention and accolades its about partnerships and progress   7engage with empathy we already discussed the debacle surrounding armando galarragas almostperfect game destroyed by a gross umpire error on what should have been the final play when you look at the replay you see that galarragas face slips from elation to disbelief in seconds the cheers of the crowd are interrupted by an eerie silence then loud boos and profanity ensue galarraga was needlessly robbed of what is considered the holy grail of pitching accomplishments this is all the more maddening when you consider that the pitcher was not a superstar expected to reach such heights he was an average journeyman who had accumulated an equal amount of wins and losses this was perhaps his one shot at pitching prominence and it had been spoiled who would blame him for lashing out at the umpirecrying out for justice even joyce himself after the game said that if he were the pitcher he would have been fast and fierce in the umpires face but there is yet another sidea third dimensionto the story more memorable than galarragas tainted perfection or jim joyces subsequent contrition was the pitchers response to the pilfering of his prize his handling of the injustice engaged the entire world in an espn interview following the game galarraga admitted he did not know what the call was going to be he was just concentrating on catching the ball and getting the out he admitted he was disappointed but conceded that the runner might have been safe he was both nervous and excited the intensity of the situation meant that he had to rely on the calm judgment of the umpire after the game however galarraga viewed the replay and knew that a perfect game had just been taken from him yet somehow when he spoke to the umpire he was able to say i know nobody is perfect he saw joyces contrition and knew he had a choice beat him down further or see things from his perspective the consideration compelled galarraga to offer a hug to joyce to make him feel okay this was no cameraready compassion galarraga was sincerely disappointed and sincerely empathetic throughout the postgame interview he consistently responded to questions and the situation with the utmost nobility he did not attempt to paint the umpire as a villain he displayed humility and perspective the progenitors of empathy in an age bent on selfpromotion and interpersonal leverage we seldom take the time to consider how someone else might feel in any given situation no one in the sports world would have faulted galarraga for ripping the umpire on national television who would have whispered a word if the pitcher had used a featured interview as a platform to demolish joyces reputation yet galarraga did nothing of the sort his comments centered on how the umpire must have felt or what he must be feeling and the acknowledgment that nobody is perfect we marvel at this kind of reaction because it is so uncommon yet an intriguing and noteworthy point is that the young pitcher cemented a more memorable place in sports history for his response to losing the perfect game than he would have if he had achieved pitching perfection those who can find a way to engage others in a manner worthy of such distinction are on the path of significant influence when dealing with a person always ask yourself how would i feel how would i react if i were in his shoes cooperativeness in conversation wrote gerald s nirenberg is achieved when you show that you consider the other persons ideas and feelings as important as your own1 we frequently hear critiques of the worlds leaders it is easy as the saying goes to sit in the stands and solve everyone elses problems what we rarely witness are people who say i cannot imagine the pressure you must be under to have the weight of an entire country on your shoulders i cannot imagine how much you must lie awake at night thinking through whether you made the right decision or said the right thing on national television once you take the time to consider the other persons perspective you will become sympathetic to his feelings and ideas you will be able to authentically and honestly say i do not blame you for feeling as you do if i were in your position i would feel just as you do this phrase so rare in discourse today will stop people in their tracks will immediately get their attention and will make them far more amenable to your ideas most people are merely looking for somebody who will listen to them and be sympathetic with their plight regardless of how large or small their woes if you can do that for another you are giving her a gift that will brighten her day even her week or month one man took a dale carnegie course years ago and reported how the special genuine interest of a nurse profoundly impacted his life martin ginsberg grew up poor without a father and with a mother on welfare one thanksgiving day he waited alone in the hospital for orthopedic surgery his mother had to work and could not be there for him loneliness was crushing him he pulled the covers and pillow over his head and wept just then a young student nurse poked her head in heard him sobbing sat on his bed pulled the covers and pillow off him and wiped away his tears she told him how lonely she was too she had to work all day and could not be with her family then she asked young martin whether he would have dinner with her he agreed so she went to the cafeteria and returned with two trays of thanksgiving dinner they talked and talked and while she was supposed to get off work at 400 pm she stayed until 1100 pm when he fell asleep many thanksgivings have come and gone since then ginsberg writes but not one ever passes without me remembering that particular one and my feelings of frustration fear loneliness and the warmth and tenderness of a stranger that somehow made it all bearable today there is little excuse for misunderstanding or overlooking anothers perspective most of us are broadcasting the details of our lives seeking significance or a sympathetic ear from anyone who will listen by taking time to research other peoples current circumstances you will avoid making assumptions about them if a person is important to you in some way every second you spend trying to better understand his perspective is a second well spent we are not empathetic creatures naturally so we must work at it many elements can factor in to how we respond in certain situations our upbringing our faith persuasion our economic status or our current career status these and more mix with our emotions to produce a mode of personal engagement with others yet when we take the very things that personally move us and allow them to paint our perceptions of others we move to a more influential place where our words can have significant impact we would all grow in stature and confidence if we could learn how to celebrate the most common thread in everyone imagine the personal barriers you could bridge in your workplace your home or your friendships if you could always respond to mistakes and disputes in a gracious manner what sort of treatment would you receive back what sort of perception would others have of you remember empathy is not a networking tactic to be learned and leveraged it is a link to immediate affluence in human relations it is galarraga giving up his right to berate jim joyce and burning his name into the heart of every sports fan the world over this is the undeniable power of a gracious understanding approach   8appeal to noble motives we all crave transcendenceto be part of something bigger than ourselves to be meaningful to the world and the people within it to have it said of us that we rose above took a stand reached beyond and did what was right and honorable and true small boys long to be the strong warrior or the heroic prince of an imaginary kingdom small girls long to be the clever maiden or the captivating princess at the center of a grand adventure at a foundational level these same desires are a reason you hold this book in your hands while relational improvement and business productivity are centerpieces of our lives their importance exists because we long to be people who make a difference tapping this noble motive in those you would like to influence can therefore reap great rewards and it is likely simpler than you think when the british newspaper and publishing magnate lord northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him that he did not want published he wrote the editor a letter he did not say please do not publish that picture of me anymore i do not like it he appealed to a nobler motive the respect and love that all of us have for motherhood he asked that the picture not be published simply because his mother did not like it when john d rockefeller jr wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of his children he too appealed to the nobler motives he did not say i do not want their pictures published he appealed to the desire deep in all of us to refrain from harming children he said you know how it is boys you have got children yourselves some of you and you know its not good for youngsters to get too much publicity such an approach does more than just appeal to a noble motive in another it assigns to that person a certain nobility it conveys the message you are capable of doing the right honorable true thing it is a subtle compliment that essentially says i believe in you these are powerful words that move people to action as a dale carnegie training graduate named sarah learned she and a friend were arranging a trip to austria and germany for a group of ten they contacted a coach company to arrange a transfer from austria to europa park in rust germany they received a quote of 965 euros for the transfer which they agreed to and confirmed via email one week before the transfer sarah received an email from peter an associate in the coach company asking her which rust she was planning to visit with the group peter told sarah that if they were visiting the rust in austria it would cost 965 euros but if it was the rust in germany it would cost 1889 euros naturally sarah was angry about the sudden change in price she knew there was little time to arrange for another transfer at a reasonable cost she was faced with a dilemma should she begin sending an angry litany of emails to peter regarding how he changed his offer or was there another way to handle the problem sarah determined that berating peter would accomplish little and would still leave her stuck with the transfer problem so she decided on a different approach she would appeal to peters noble motives and attempt to fix the problem through honest interaction she acted calmly she replied to his email by asking him if there were two different europa parks in two different cities called rust peter replied in the negative sarah replied with another email including a copy of his initial offer and explained that she had clearly specified that the transfer was for europa park rust germany and that based on his reply there was only one she then concluded i kindly request an explanation for this change of pricing as i am sure as a respectful company you value your initial offers and care about maintaining your credibility with your clients sarah received an apology from peter the next day explaining that there had been some confusion on their end he then gladly confirmed the initial offer by appealing to peters and his companys nobler motives sarah was able to solve the problem without further financial or emotional cost most of us do not recognize these noble desires in ourselves while we are children but when we grow up we see them in our children and feel them well up inside of us when we watch films such as the kings speech gladiator or little women in some way we all want our everydayness to include heroic elements what if  writes author and former marriage and family counselor john eldredge what if those deep desires in our hearts are telling us the truth revealing to us the life that we were meant to live1 few would refute that there is something noble and redeemable in everyone all of us being idealists at heart and preferring to present ourselves in the best light like to think of motives that sound good if we provide an opportunity for others to do the same if we do not assume that their motives are selfish or deceitful we allow them to increase their own selfworth in their response to us we allow them to prove us right about them todays advertisers are exceptionally good at applying this principle consider the campaigns for environmentally friendly products doves campaign for real beauty and other products that make either the buyer or the company seem nobler in motive nonprofit organizations also employ this tactic and use social media to propagate their messages in these ways this works because most people will react favorably to your proposals if they feel that you admire them for being honest unselfish and fair one morning at breakfast university of san francisco business professor david batstone learned that one of his favorite restaurants in the bay area was using slave labor the newspaper article that exposed the atrocity detailed how the restaurant forced employees to work under harsh conditions by threatening to expose their status as illegal immigrants the story caught david offguard and ignited a passion within him to start the not for sale campaign an organization that seeks among other things to expose modernday slave labor in communities and companies across america to hear david speak about the campaign is to be compelled to join in this is precisely what he wants to see happen he knows the issue will touch everyone the thought of slave labor in this day and age is appallingit makes us indignant and ready to rise up to help in 2010 david and his team rolled out a new initiative called free2work the program is actually an app for your smartphone the consumer scans a product and the app then produces a grade for the company that makes the product if for example you want to buy a shirt from patagonia you can scan the item and the free2work app will give patagonia a manufacturing grade indicating how well the company performs with regard to fair trade employment and overseas manufacturing the app provides a new level of accountability for manufacturing companies and a new level of responsibility for consumers we cannot claim ignorance anymore for supporting companies that employ slave labor or fail to be transparent in their international manufacturing efforts on a deeper level the app speaks directly to the noble motives of the companies involved when held accountable for their business dealings and asked to meet a high and humane standard companies tend to comply they understand that consumers increasingly care about how products are made and how their companies treat the people they employ the free2work campaign targets the noble motives of consumers and manufacturing companies to incite positive cultural change how can you begin targeting the noble desires of your constituents and vendors in a way that will contribute to changing the ethos of a particular industry that may need new life new standards this is an important question to answer today the key to successful growth and positive impact inside and outside the marketplace is what digital maven amy martin calls the business of humanity her response to the 2011 tsunami in japan exemplifies the power of appealing to noble motives in the digital age2 it also serves as a candid reminder of the consequences of not embodying this principle during a latenight workout on an elliptical machine martin was perusing others twitter updates on her ipad the earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit in japan and suddenly the twittersphere was inundated with the news she flipped to cnn on the television and caught live footage of vehicles being washed away and people frantically trying to outrun the crushing tide coming ashore i was not sure what to do she blogged but i felt accountable and compelled to help in some way she began sifting through the most relevant tweets and links and redistributing them to her large following she also asked her followers to send her any valuable information they had that she could broadcast to others for four hours she continued and none of it had anything to do with marketing or promoting products it was about people coming together through a virtual medium to help each other she wrote it was the business of humanity still during her humanitarian efforts she witnessed an alarming contrastlarge television news outlets seemingly crippled by an illtimed concern for ratings while she was in the midst of the digital effort certain prominent news channels toggled back and forth between dramatic footage of the catastrophe and the latest celebrity spectacle i was aghast she wrote in my opinion if these news organizations are in the least concerned about the way the public perceives their brand then they should exercise more discernment and care more about saving lives than the hollywood beat    sometimes you need to put hollywood in the backseat and focus on the right thing to do martin clarifies something that is easy to forget amid the push to transactional effect the many social media channels to which we are privy are first and foremost interpersonal communication tools designed for humans to connect they were not invented she notesfor marketers many of martins followers echoed the sentiment in her blog post and appreciated her appeal to the noble motives not only in the large news organizations but also in all who had the capacity to help those suffering in the wake of the tsunami while martin was selling nothing that night it is no wonder 13 million people follow her on twitter and some of the most prominent businesses celebrities and professional sports teams call on her for digital guidance she is one who knows that doing business in the digital age is predicated on doing the business of humanity well so often we are content to simply plug others into our digital world and browse them like commodities until we are ready to engage in some sort of transaction such sentiment removes the nobility inherent in our shared humanity it makes our relationships merely tools of transaction rather than transcendence to truly connect with people you must celebrate their inherent dignity in doing so you celebrate yours appeal to noble motives and you can move the masses and yourself along with them   9share your journey peddling ice to inuits selling seawater to a dolphin compelling consumers to wear cotton today the last of those does not seem like a stretch examine the threads of every clothing item you own and chances are high many if not most of them are cotton but in the 1970s that was probably not the case polyester and its synthetic cousins were the rage they did not wrinkle they resisted stains and they were formfittingand as a result cottons market share dwindled to about 33 percent1 the industry decided to fight back it needed to make cotton desirable again so it did what any industry would do it started a trade association hired ad firms and rebranded cotton the slogan they settled on to save their industry cotton the fabric of our lives they had celebrities pitch the slogan barbara walters famously donned a hawaiian shirt looked into the camera and said cotton    its making my life comfortable today2 when the cotton industry was on the line its members made the strategic decision that the best way to get people to buy their threads was by threading cotton into a personal story cotton was not a soft white fluffy fiber that was spun into threads that became fabric that became garments cotton gave life meaning by tying it together into a beautiful story today cotton commands about twothirds of the market3 people do not want to be treated as commodities but more than that they do not want to see their lives as ordinary people want to know that they matter and the best way to show them that they do is by allowing them to connect with a larger story people and businesses that understand this principle are unbeatable in 2011 apple topped fortunes survey of business people as the worlds most admired company for the fourth year in a row4 part of the companys secret is found in one of the most famous tv ads in history in 1984 during the super bowl apple unveiled its macintosh personal computer for the first time the ad was aimed at distinguishing the radically new and creativityencouraging mac from the conformity of the masses to apple that was ibm in the ad an athletic young woman carrying a large hammer runs into a room of lookalike dressalike pseudopeople she throws the hammer at a great screen and destroys an orwellian big brothertype figure it is the dawning of a new day treating people as mere social security numbers with arms and legs is over oneonone business was the wave of the future the proof of this concept is not found just in apples success it is also found in some simple shoes blake mycoskie started toms shoes after a story disrupted his life he was traveling in the developing world when he noticed a simple problem the kids he saw had no shoes no shoes meant a lot of other nos in their stories    a lot of deprivation so blake decided to start a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes for a child in need the first year he had the pleasure of giving away ten thousand shoes today that number is over one million but that is not where the story ends one afternoon in an airport waiting area mycoskie noticed a girl wearing a red pair of his shoes without revealing his identity he asked about them the girl told him the whole story behind toms in such detail that it rivaled his own description of the company it was a moment that made him realize the truth is what is inside this box is not nearly as important as what it represents toms is no longer a shoe company its a oneforone company in addition to attracting the interest of mainstream media starting with vogue time and people magazine toms shoes attracted prestigious partners explains power blogger valeria maltoni ralph lauren who had not partnered with anyone for 40 years joined in with toms shoes for the rugby brand the ad agency working with att created a commercial to tell the authentic story of how blake used their network to stay in touch and work on the go maltoni concludes her thoughts on the success of toms with an insightful nod to the power of this principle people remember and when a message is a mission they will tell your story to anyone who will hear iteven a stranger at an airport and by doing that they become your strongest advocates in marketing your product    the lesson influence is given5 while larger stories can be inviting the land of small personal stories can be intimidating it is one thing to reveal a because cure or commodity it is another thing entirely to reveal yourself in april 2003 author david kuo was driving home from a party with his wife he woke up in the er told he had a brain tumor likely to kill him in a matter of months at three of the clock on that palm sunday morning david and his wife kim faced a decision how much of their story did they want people to know how willing were they to share it the tendency was to remain private but they resisted that impulse and kim started calling friends telling them the story and telling them to tell others so that they could pray within hours a page for them was set up on caringbridgeorg a nonprofit site where people facing serious illness can post updates needs and anything else that they would like in the weeks and months that followed the kuos decided that the more information they could share the more people they could helpthey knew they were hardly alone in their cancer battle that decision was lifechanging for them they saw their story as part of something far larger than them it eventually provided a type of opportunity for them with other people facing similar challenges their first bit of advice for everyone share your story that is something ann m baker from seattle washington learned in a dale carnegie training course most people treasure their privacy as i do however when faced with breast cancer chemotherapy and radiation treatments i did not want to share the worry and the painbut when my cancer news slipped out among family friends and coworkers i was overwhelmed with email encouragement even family acquaintances whom i had never met emailed their breast cancer stories including phone numbers and followon getwell cards this amazing outpouring of courage and love started a recovery journey that has changed my life    and thanks to email i know that no one needs or wants to journey the cancer road alone for life is not about me it is about us there is nothing wrong if something that is about us is also good for me one digital media blogger with more than a million followers put out the word that she was going to have lasik surgery to correct her eyesight not only was she going to have the surgery she was going to stream it live on her blog for all who were interested in having the surgery themselves transparency became her currency she not only got 2015 vision she got better insight into a whole new way of using the digital world to share our personal journeys with others she cites the live stream of a friends recent wedding or a clients use of live streaming video to watch his sons football games when hes away on business as good examples aside from sports entertainment and marketing what else can live video be used for she asks will it be adopted as a new communication channel used for functional benefit    what about weddings graduations club meetings religious ceremonies birthdays coaching instructional content cooking classes births or even funerals the opportunities are endless if they are embraced6 people trudge through most days with little excitement in their lives but our digital age provides so many opportunities to give people an authentic view of who you are or what your company strives to be thus creating touch points of commonality that draw you into closer friendship with others it is easy to make a video instead of presenting a few drawings it is easy to create a dynamic website to support a new company or organization it is easy to use video conferencing instead of a call and to show a compelling presentation to all involved instead of simply telling them but people have come to expect these things too to really make your idea pop take a unique approach step beyond the bounds of your computer and do something people do not see every day use all of the tools available to you and your imagination to make your ideas vivid interesting and dramatic share your stories and others will be willing to share theirs together you will create a new and larger story more and more commonand commonly effective at building influential relationshipsis the authentic intersection of personal and professional life while this intersection will always have certain judicious boundaries many of the historically businesslike boundaries have been lowered or removed altogether today because most people have come to remember that the short and longterm success of all interactionstransactional or otherwiserides on the depth of the relationship the more a colleague friend or customer shares of your journey the more you can accomplish together when your journey is our journey we are both compelled to see where it goes   10throw down a challenge when it comes to discussions about the best players in nba history two names usually come up larry and magic larry bird and earvin magic johnson were individually two of the most compelling players to ever grace the hardwood courtsgifted passers who possessed almost otherworldly senses of players and positions on the basketball court they were virtually unrivaled in clutch situations they prided themselves for their defense as much as for their offense and they worked harder than any of their teammates and they defined basketball for a decade magic beat larry in the 1979 ncaa championship then beat him again in the 1984 nba championship larry beat magic in 1985 and then lost to him again in 1987 for most of their careers they did not much like each other but their respect for each other knew no bounds then in 1991 magic was unexpectedly forced to retire from professional basketball because he contracted hiv the day after magics announcement bird found himself preparing for a regularseason game he stretched his back loosened up by jogging through the corridors of the arena shot baskets from his usual spots on the floor    and for the first time in his life he had no desire to play his competitor who by then had become his friend was gone from the sport magic had played a major role in making bird who he was a few months later at his retirement ceremony magic said i want to thank larry bird personally for bringing out the best in magic johnson because without you i could have never risen to the top1 some people seem to think that competition is a dirty word it is not competition is one of the most compelling realities of the natural world while connection is necessary to keep us thriving competition is necessary to keep us striving as iron sharpens iron wrote king solomon israels third monarch so one man sharpens another2 the sound of iron sharpening iron is about as subtle as the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard but king solomon recognized that the only way to get the best out of yourself and others is to challenge and collide while a life of permanent interpersonal pleasantries appears more comfortable and sounds more peaceful a relationally complacent life is a fruitless life a challenge does not have to involve blood sweat and tears coke issued a challenge to consumers in a 2010 social media ad campaignthey challenged people not to smile coke set up a special vending machine on a real college campus this machine did not just dispense soft drinks it surprised students with everything from free bottles of coke to a bouquet of flowers a pizza and a sixfoot sub3 the cameras caught it all and the results were streamed to youtube the sheer joy and surprise of the students receiving the giftssome highfiving others hugging all smiling and laughingalso put smiles on the faces of the nearly four million viewers who watched it online the challenge to viewers was not to smile and it garnered millions of willing failures just as coke had hoped for one of the things that drove the early wild days of the internet was the passionate competition between microsoft and aol easily forgotten in this era of apple and google the aolmicrosoft battle accelerated the availability of cuttingedge services for the customer each company envisioned the day when consumers would perform the majority of their transactions online get most of their information online and live a big chunk of their lives online the companies loathed each other and their cultures were vastly differentone was a consumeroriented marketing company that happened to use technology and the other was a technology company that happened to use consumer marketing4 aol testified against microsoft in the antitrust trial against the giant software company and yet that competition made both companies larger and more successful than either would have been without the other yes everyone faces challenges in their lives and people commonly say it does not matter what the challenge is what matters is how one responds to it true enough some people get injured or sick or hurt and give up they put themselves on the conveyor belt to the grave others rise to great heights take teddy roosevelt for example a sickly child young teddy had lifethreatening asthma oftentimes he struggled to breathe and the asthma weakened his heart then when he was twelve his father put down a challenge theodore you have the mind but you have not the body and without the help of the body the mind cannot go as far as it should you must make your body its hard drudgery to make ones body but i know you will do it5 in response the boy half grinned and half snarledthe first reported instance of the look that would become known the world over he then jerked his head back and replied through clenched teeth ill make my body6 over the next year his life consisted of strenuous exercise and as his strength grew so did his boldness and daring he plunged into icy rivers and climbed seven mountains including one of them twice in a single day and as he did these things his obsession with nature began everything from birds to moss fascinated him and he collected several hundred specimens for preservation in the roosevelt museum of natural history7 without his fathers challenge what might have become of such a sickly boy the challenge changed him forever it is also true however that the challenge itself is just as important as the response to it challenges that inspire and compel are very different from challenges that discourage and depress in 2010 shaun king pastor of courageous church in atlanta wanted to raise money for a permanent home for disabled haitian orphans but how to do it this was the first challenge in the digital age creativity in such matters is greatly expanded he wanted to reach the biggest audience possible with the message he came up with the idea for a celebrity charity auction with a twist people would not be bidding for a picture an autograph or a date they would bid for a celebrity to follow them on twitter and retweet their posts he approached desperate housewives star eva longoria parker with the challenge she jumped in and then challenged her celebrity buddies to become part of it as well they did and twitchange was born8 in 2010 more than 175 celebrities with a combined ninety million followers garnered thirty million hits and raised more than 5000009 that is the power of a meaningful challenge in an age where our reach is long and influence expansive there are pernicious halftruths in the world but few are as disturbing as go along to get along that is not a way to live a life raise a family or run a business people do not want to be leveled down they want to be leveled up they want their vision raised and sometimes that means throwing down a challenge charles schwab once said the way to get things done is to stimulate competition when we compete we are striving to win because winning generates a feeling of success and importance when victory is defined as team victoryfor a because a country a cure or a companywinning is all the more compelling because the competition forces us to communicate and connect on an area of affinity the competition comes to mean as much to us for its camaraderie as for its ultimate result look around your sphere of influence for an area of affinity that can generate a competition that can mean something more than reaching the finish linesomething that can mean lasting friendships and corporate influence for positive change if its one person you would like to help change throw down a compelling challenge that gets you both involved in the arena nobody said challenges were clean endeavors get dirty for the sake of others and they will get dirty for you   part 4how to lead change without resistance or resentment   1begin on a positive note in his classic book leadership is an art author max depree famously asserted the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality the last is to say thank you in between the leader is a servant1 a tendency is to take the assertion to mean we must bear down and get the ugly stuff said first as though it were to the leaders advantage to get the bad news out of the way but this is not the case especially in a day and age when bad news travels at the speed of light while a current relationship whether between a company and its customers or between two individuals might be strained or even in serious trouble it does little good to start off a conversation on a negative note like a play whose first act features a tragedy it sets a gloomy and unpleasant stage shoulders sag faces fall and hearts begin to sink inside the recipients imagine this effect spread viruslike throughout the ranks of an organization or across a companys entire value chain or across an entire country you will be forced to work against a wave of negative psychological and physiological reactions from the start and even if you can overcome them quickly there is no need to spend the little time you may have trying to undo something that could have been avoided in the first place instead begin a conversation with honest and genuine appreciation the receiver will be more amenable to your ideas and less defensive or resistant many of us have experienced that defensiveness and resistance when dealing with customer service agentsamazingly enough but sanjiv ekbote who had recently read how to win friends and influence people knew how to handle a difficult situation2 he had recently purchased a house with a home warranty one evening the bathroom faucet began to leak so he called the warranty company and within four hours a young technician arrived to fix the problem first he replaced the valve but the water began flowing faster so the technician capped the pipe but the water pressure broke seals and water began leaking inside the walls sanjiv was upset and immediately called the warranty company to ask them to send a more experienced technician he could have ranted and raved at the person who answered the phone but instead he paused he calmly provided his information and then he thanked the representative for sending out a technician so quickly he explained what had happened and the woman tracked down an expert technician scheduled the earliest appointment possible and waived the service fee if sanjiv had reacted differently would he have received the same service this seems like a rather simple technique yet it is deceptively difficult to practice let us consider deprees mandate for leaders to understand why at the heart of our misinterpretation of his statement is the connotation that the term reality carries in our daily discourse why is it that we have to face reality deliver a dose of reality that is reluctantly swallowed like foul medicine bring someone back to reality from an idyllic dreamland that does not jibe with the hardnosed facts this is the mindset from which we often approach crucial conversations is reality actually a bitter pill or at least an overly pragmatic one probably not but we may be hardwired to see it that way particularly when something is nagging at us our huntergatherer ancestry still dictates that we pay particular attention to the most dramatic unfolding around us and usually these are negative ones our survival depends on this abilityor it once did anyway neuroscientists in a variety of studies have shown that we care more about the threat of bad things than we do about the prospect of good things our negative brain tripwires are far more sensitive than our positive triggers wrote ray williams a leadership coach3 we even remember negative events better or at least our memories are skewed toward them unfortunately research has shown that this effect is not limited to events but extends to the impressions we form of other people we may weigh those traits or behaviors we deem to be negative more heavily than the positive particularly if they are moral or ethical in nature4 at those times when we hope most strongly to encourage change in others we are often frustrated with current conduct our brains are preoccupied with the negative behavior it shapes our perception of reality it crowds out the positive and so it is no surprise that in our communications we cannot seem to help jumping into the problemor from our listeners perspectives the criticism our listeners brains are just like ours the negative or critical in what we say becomes their point of obsession it drowns out all possibility of discovering the positive opportunities within the conversation i am sure you have seen it happen faces grow tight expressions become studiously blank and only the eyes may reveal the inner rant of protest that is blocking out anything else you might have to say if we do not work hard to avoid this drama we shoot ourselves in the leadership foot in a classic study on how negative and positive feedback affect performance j sidney shrauger and saul rosenberg discovered quite simply that our performance suffers when we receive feedback that we have failed in some way5 now if we are confident and have strong selfesteem the effect is less severe however a secondary reaction to criticism is to discount the validity of the feedbackwe reject it outright so it has little effect on our behavior except to sully our attitude why take the risk why not mitigate these effects on performance or attitude right from the start in an article on leadership skills for teachers trent lorcher explained how as a basketball coach he had handled a disappointing loss with his team we lost an important game on account of several missed free throws my natural reaction was to yell at my team instead i praised them for being aggressive and getting to the free throw line consistently we then practiced free throws for the next hour my players already upset by the loss responded well to praise6 in his latest book good boss bad boss robert sutton an organizational psychologist relates a story sent to him by a former us army officer most of the mans superior officers were jerksnasty belittling and meanspirited but his battalion commander was different i got out of a line a few times and he brought me in immediately and counseled me on my behavior he did not yell or belittle me but i got the point and was embarrassed that i had let him down i am a better person for it and id like to think that i have picked up his habits and that i emulate his actions by treating people the way they should be treated7 we can overcome our baser instincts by acknowledging our inherent tendencies and working to focus our attention on the positive its not just positive thinking its rewiring our brains to recognize that our perceptions are not necessarily in line with truth stopping to analyze our underlying assumptions about a situation and questioning those assumptions until we get to a fuller picture we can train our mirrorneuron systemsthose cells discovered in recent decades that enable us to understand the actions of others to interpret their intentions and to predict what they might do nextto include positive behaviors and what they reveal about the people we coach and that is essential if we want to be authentic in our appreciation we need to find a truthful positive point to begin from and we need to show appreciation that resonates with the receiver the best bosses according to robert sutton take the time to discover how each member of their teams think and act it is not easy leaders despite their best efforts are often naturally removed from situations that may be the most revealing about individual personal dynamics but making the effort is worth the payout in terms of influence and effectiveness as a leader when we acknowledge the value a person has to our organization we establish a positive tone for open communication of course we must get around to the matter at hand eventually perhaps worse than attempting to get the bad news out of the way is attempting to soften it or simply not address it at all this mum effecta term coined by psychologists sidney rosen and abraham tesser in the early 1970shappens because people want to avoid becoming the target of others negative emotions8 we all have the opportunity to lead change yet it often requires of us the courage to deliver bad news to our superiors we do not want to be the innocent messenger who falls before a firing line when our survival instincts kick in they can override our courage until the truth of a situation gets watered down into pabulum the mum effect and the resulting filtering can have devastating effects in a steep hierarchy writes sutton what starts out as bad news becomes happier and happier as it travels up the ranksbecause after each boss hears the news from his or her subordinates he or she makes it sound a bit less bad before passing it up the chain9 leading with the positive and resisting the urge to promote drama are tools that can help us bolster our resolve techniques for stepping confidently into the breach and leaders who model this behavior are less likely to be blindsided by catastrophes they should have known about all along at sonda andres navarro found a way to institutionalize this approach by adopting a threeforone rule we try to criticize as little as we can we have a rule if you get into this company and you find someone whom you do not like and you think does not do his work the way he should do not say anything write it down on a piece of paper people are then required to discover at least three good things about the person before they can open a discussion designed to change the others behavior10 how then do we engage in interactions in which undesirable topics must be discussed we know intuitively it is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points if the praise is contrived or if the segue from praise to criticism is too abrupt then this principle will fail to avoid this consider the following first the praise you offer must be genuine and heartfelt not just a tool to bide time while you compose your criticisms second you must be able to create a smooth flow from point to point third offer constructive advice rather than criticism following the praise this style of communicating a point can be particularly difficult in written form without the natural flow of a conversation that presents opportunities to segue from one topic to the next it may seem to the other person that you were just buttering her up if the topic is particularly contentious you should really have a facetoface conversation many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word but which signals that the criticism is about to begin this may make the listener question the sincerity of the praise use and instead and provide constructive advice rather than criticism this is possibly the most effective way to address an issue in written form without seeming false in your praise beginning with praise and appreciation will help you help employees be more productive vendors be more committed and friends and family be more inclined to see your point of view a positive outlook always places interactions on a positive path   2acknowledge your baggage beth was a highlevel executive in a fortune 100 company while much loved by her bosses and her team she was in the throes of battle with a colleague harvey who headed up another division alls fair in love and war right well beth was living by that motto revealing her most vindictive side in their interactions but beth wanted to be a better leader and so she enlisted the aid of marshall goldsmith executive coach and author of what got you here will not get you there what she learned is that while she was respected by many her behavior with harvey was still affecting her reputation she needed to negotiate a peace agreement with harvey and to do so she had to admit fault this might be one of the hardest situations in which to follow this approachone in which you have to acknowledge your mistakes to the person those mistakes have harmed tensions on both sides are already high competition may be a driving factor and you may feel it is not safe to make yourself vulnerable yet these are also the situations that can be most effectively defused by talking about your own mistakes first so what did beth say you know harvey i have got a lot of feedback here and the first thing i want to say is that i am positive about a lot of it the next thing i want to say is that there are some things at which i want to be better i have been disrespectful to you the company and the traditions in the company please accept my apologies there is no excuse for this behavior1 harveys response he got tears in his eyes admitted that he too had behaved dishonorably and declared that together they would improve a lengthy embittered turf war ended simply by proclaiming the mistakes she had made it is not nearly so difficult to be open to a conversation that may include a discussion of your faults if the other person begins by humbly admitting that she too is far from impeccable admitting ones mistakeseven when one has not corrected themcan help convince somebody to change his behavior carnegie the evereffective communicator applied this same lesson when writing on it he began the discussion with a story of how he had failed as a mentor and coach to help readers become open to the idea its a subtle and masterly strategyand proof that it can be effective in many forms the difficulty that leaders face in implementing this strategy rests on one critical element you must admit that you have made mistakes that you are fallible leaders across the globe struggle with this even though most understand inherently the value of it and if they do not understand it inherently research certainly supports it researchers at the institute for health and human potential conducted a study of thirtyfive thousand people on the factors in career advancement the item found to be most linked to career advancement freely admitting to making mistakes2 admitting you have made a mistake is like the first step in a twelvestep program it is both the hardest and the most important until we accept accountability how can we learn from our mistakes use them to propel us forward and encourage others to trust us to leave the road of continual failure a person must first utter the three most difficult words to say i was wrong he has to open his eyes admit his mistakes and accept complete responsibility for his current wrong actions and attitudes3 portia nelson poetically describes this process in her autobiography in five short chapters what begins in many of our first chapters as a pit of despair progresses only to detachment from the problem until we are able to accept responsibility for our faults once we see the link between where we are and what we do only then do we begin to see quicker solutions to our problems only then do we begin to walk around the deep holes in our path altogether eventually we learn we can simply walk down a less problematic path that is to say we move from merely being proficient problem solvers to behaving more proficiently4 aside from the personal gains of admitting our mistakes the trust it builds with our colleagues and customers our friends and families and our community members is invaluable marshall goldsmith writes no one expects us to be right all the time but when were wrong they certainly expect us to own up to it in that sense being wrong is an opportunityan opportunity to show what kind of person and leader we are    how well you own up to your mistakes makes a bigger impression than how you revel in your successes5 when we talk about our mistakes it makes us human it becomes easier for people to relate to us they feel we understand their perspective better and in this mental space they are more open to our advice what is lovely about this principle is that we all make mistakes and so have an ample supply of stories to use when trying to put someone at ease remember to follow the story with constructive advice not straightup criticism how did carnegie use the principle with his niece and new assistant josephine by considering her lack of experience and his own blunders at her age and experience level you have made a mistake josephine he would begin but lord knows its no worse than many i have made judgment comes only with experience and you are better than i was at your age i have been guilty of so many silly things myself i have very little inclination to criticize you or anyone but do not you think it would have been wiser if you had done soandso by admitting your own mistakes you direct the other persons attention away from his own you soften the approach and avoid raising his defenses immediately when you acknowledge your baggage trust builds naturally   3call out mistakes quietly during the first days of his presidency coolidge and his family had not yet left their thirdfloor suite at the willard hotel in washington in the early morning hours the president awoke to see a cat burglar going through his clothes removing a wallet and a watch chain coolidge spoke i wish you would not take that    i do not mean the watch and chain only the charm read what is engraved on the back of it the burglar read presented to calvin coolidge speaker of the house by the massachusetts general court coolidge then identified himself as the president persuaded the burglar to relinquish the watch charm led him into a quiet conversation found out that the young man and his college roommate were unable to pay their hotel bill and buy train tickets back to their campus counted out 32 from the wallet which the dazed young man had also relinquished declared it to be a loan and advised the student that in order to avoid the secret service he should leave as unconventionally as he had entered1 calling attention indirectly to someone is mistakes or missteps works wonders with people who may resent any direct criticismand that defines most people leaders of all kinds have a fantastic tool available to them for sending a subtle message about the behavior they are trying to encourage they simply have to model that behavior themselves and if they do not the message to those around them will be loud and clear i tell you i want you to behave in such a way but its not actually that important otherwise i would do it myself this concept is john maxwells thirteenth law of leadership in his classic the 21 irrefutable laws of leadership he calls it the law of the picture because people do what they see he tells the story of platoon leader dick winters of easy company during world war ii winters believed that it was an officers responsibility to go first set an example lead the charge and take risks alongside his men one of the most remarkable incidents demonstrating winterss way of leading by example occurred soon after dday on the road to carentan a town that easy company need to take from the germans as the american paratroopers under his command approached the town they became pinned down by german machinegun fire huddled in ditches on either side of the road they would not move forward when ordered to yet if they did not move they would eventually be cut to pieces winters tried rallying them he coaxed them he kicked them he ran from one ditch to the other as machinegun bullets flew by finally he jumped into the middle of the road bullets glancing off the ground near him and shouted at the men to get moving everyone got up and moved forward as one and they helped to take the town2 at times it is not possible to influence others by modeling behavior either because you are not with the people you are trying to influence or because you actually are not immersed in what it is that they are doing how do we influence behavior then the authors of influencer offer some compelling advice for these situations  identify those in the group team family or community who have the most influence over others and get them to model the behavior you want to promote  develop a community approach to the behavior by appealing to the broader good peer pressure goes a long way toward influencing the thoughts and actions of individuals  make any changes possible to the resources available or the environment to make the new behavior or mindset easy to adopt3 at the end of world war ii soldiers were returning from the front lines and reentering the workforce in the process they were displacing the women who had stepped up and filled many positions in their absence many women chose to remain in the workforce which created animosity between the sexes in the workplace but also gave rise to a new view of the role women could play in the american economy restaurants around the country were facing a particular struggle the returning soldiers were granted positions as cooks the women who had held those positions were demoted to waitresses positions of lower pay the result an antagonistic relationship between cooks and waitresses in an environment in which cooperation is a necessity everybody suffered including the patrons who often received late or wrong orders employees were quitting and restaurants were losing customers so the national restaurant association enlisted the help of william foote whyte a professor at the university of chicago to solve the problem he observed the activity in a sample of restaurants watching as cooks and waitresses slung insults ignored each other and behaved vindictively at the expense of the customer while many consultants might have been tempted to alter this unhealthy social climate by teaching interpersonal skills conducting teambuilding exercises or changing the pay system whyte took a different approach explained the authors in his view the best way to solve the problem was to change the way employees communicated4 working with a pilot restaurant whyte recommended they use a simple metal spindle to place orders with the kitchen the waitresses would put the orders on the spindle and the cooks would fulfill the orders in whatever way was most efficient but making sure that those that were placed first were prioritized the results were immediate decreased conflict decreased customer complaints and communication and behavior that were more respectful on both sides sometimes the best way to correct behavior is not to openly punish the wrong behavior but to use the situation as a platform for building selfconfidence and deeper connection bob hoover a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows was flying back to his home in los angeles from an air show in san diego at three hundred feet in the air both engines suddenly stopped by deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane and save himself and two others on board but it was badly damaged hoovers first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplanes fuel just as he suspected the world war ii propeller plane had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline upon returning to the airport he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane the young man was sick with the agony of his mistake tears streamed down his face as hoover approached he had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well you can imagine hoovers anger one could anticipate the tonguelashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for such carelessness but hoover did not scold the mechanic he did not even criticize his gross negligence instead he threw his big arm around the mans shoulder and said to show you i am sure that you will never do this again i want you to service my f51 tomorrow in life sometimes mistakes are the byproduct of extenuating circumstances we do not always fail at work because of incompetence we can fail because our hearts and minds are not engaged due to problems at home or elsewhere the leader understands that mistakes and failures surface from all corners of life and therefore should be treated as isolated and redeemable instances rather than fatal flaws in an age where emerging leaders are skeptical of inauthentic leadership tactics it is best to confront mistakes honestly while not using them as opportunities for condemnation to many passiveaggressive approaches or manipulative encounters with leaders diminish their view of that particular leader and make them cynical about their contribution to the task at hand or even the organization they serve it is to your advantage to pull people out of their dejected state as quickly as possibly do so by calling out their mistakes quietly and returning them to a place of confidence and strength   4ask questions instead of giving direct orders in the military orders are a part of everyday operations you receive orders and you are expected to follow them to a t but when captain d michael abrashoff took command of the uss benfold a guided missile destroyer he knew he was facing a challenge that would require a different approach the benfold was not the top ship in the navy not by far the crew was sullen morale was low and most of the sailors on the ship were just biding their time until their discharge date to add complexity to an already difficult leadership situation the previous commander had not been well loved so the crew was assessing their new leader with a harsh and critical eye but this was captain abrashoffs first sea command and he was determined to do it well his first step learn about his crew it did not take me long to realize that my young crew was smart talented and full of good ideas that frequently came to nothing because no one in charge had ever listened to them wrote captain abrashoff in its your ship his leadership chronicles of his time aboard the benfold1 so captain abrashoff vowed to listen to his crew but not just when they decided to speak up he knew that if he wanted to turn the ship around the ideas for how to do that had to come from the crew and what better way to find out what their ideas were than to interview them captain abrashoff interviewed five crew members a day until he had interviewed every crew member on boardapproximately 310 of them what did he learn that they wasted a lot of time on dreary chores such as painting the ship six times a year so abrashoff found a way to replace all of the fasteners on the ship that caused rust streaks and a way to run many of the exterior panels through a special paint process the ship did not have to be painted again for almost two years freeing up time for more valuable endeavors such as advanced training he learned that many of them had signed up for the navy as a way to pay for college so he arranged for sat testing on the ship and longdistance advanced placement courses for the crew he found that many of them came from rough backgrounds and had led tough lives but also were very attached to their families so he included family members as much as possible in the sailors lives by sending birthday cards letters of praise and other important notes to parents and spouses i wanted to link our goals wrote captain abrashoff so that they would see my priority of improving benfold as an opportunity for them to apply their talents and give their jobs a real purpose what was the result of asking questions of his crew a serious shift in morale a greater willingness to push the limits of what was possible and some of the highest testing rankings the navy had ever seen if captain abrashoff had stepped on board issued a directive that the crew was to improve its rankings and then outlined how that would happen what might the result have been well never know but it is unlikely that the benfold would have become the shipor the leadership catalystit became asking questions not only makes an order more palatable and reduces resentment it often stimulates creativity and innovation in solving the problem at hand people are more likely to follow a new path if they feel that they have been involved in shaping it the familial leaders of the marriott organization were known for their intense devotion to inspecting marriott hotels to ensure that they were well run bill marriot jr in particular was constantly on the go asking questions and paying close attention to the responses writes ed fuller the leader of marriott international lodging in fact sometimes he would be criticized for listening to too many peopleand listening just as hard to frontline people as to senior executives    his favorite question during his frontline visitations was what do you think it was his way of combating the tendency of employees to shy away from rocking the boat or passing on bad news to the boss2 bill marriot jr was an enlightened leader who understood the negative power of the mum effect and how best to engage employees in making every marriott property live up to his expectations while we understand that asking questions increases the engagement of those we hope to influence many leaders do not take this route why because at times asking questions can seem like a roundabout way to lead people to the answer you already have in your head why not just tell them it would be more expedient people do not like to be ordered around that is why leaders are also reluctant to ask questions because they do not know what responses might result what if the other person does not head in the direction you were intending there is no way to overcome that possibility instead leaders must think about it as an opportunity rather than as a risk the answer you get may be betterlikely will be betterthan the one you already know when ian macdonald of johannesburg south africa the general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision machine parts had the opportunity to accept a very large order he was convinced that he could not meet the promised delivery date the work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept the order instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the order through he called everybody together explained the situation to them and told them how much it would mean to the company and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time then he started asking questions is there anything we can do to handle this order can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that will make it possible to take the order is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that would help the employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the order the order was accepted produced and delivered on time while it should not be the case many leaders dread doing performance reviews they know they have employees who need improvement and they foresee a battle as they deliver criticism and the employees become increasingly defensive and sullen these leaders need to take a different tack most employees have a keen understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses while some may be obtuse most if you ask will tell you exactly what you are thinking many organizational psychologists recommend instituting a selfappraisal stage in the review process studies have shown that selfappraisals lead to reviews that are more satisfying for managers and employees and have a greater positive effect on performance3 begin by giving the employee some questions to think about prior to the review what do you think you are exceptionally good at what are your goals for the coming year where do you think you could improve your skills or abilities to help you meet those goals imagine beginning the meeting with a complete set of answers to these questions answers that you do not have to deliver at least 80 percent of the time they will have come to the same conclusions you have arrived at and the conversation will be a much more positive one the wonderful thing about asking questions is that it can be effectively done in almost any medium what if you sent a text or tweet to your team with a question about how to handle a recalcitrant client would that help employees who might be weak in this area reconsider their own methods or recognize that they do not have one you can ask pretty powerful questions in 140 characters or less questions allow you to create a conversationin any mediumthat can lead to a better place for all involved and it allows everybody to feel that they were involved in shaping the outcome would not you rather be asked a question than be given an order   5mitigate fault in the summer of 1941 sergeant james allen ward was awarded the victoria cross for climbing out onto the wing of his wellington bomber thirteen thousand feet above zuider zee to extinguish a fire in the starboard engine secured by only a rope around his waist he managed to smother the fire and then return along the wing to the safety of the aircrafts cabin winston churchill an admirer as well as a performer of swashbuckling exploits summoned the shy new zealander to 10 downing street ward struck dumb with awe in churchills presence was unable to answer the prime ministers questions churchill surveyed the unhappy hero with some compassion you must feel very humble and awkward in my presence he said yes sir managed ward then you can imagine how humble and awkward i feel in yours said churchill1 with just a few words churchill moved ward from a miserable fool to the hero he was he mitigated fault and helped ward save face few of us take the time to consider how to let another save face we ride roughshod over others feelings getting our own way finding fault issuing threats criticizing a child or employee in front of others we could offer a considerate word or two take the other persons feelings into account pull them asideanything to alleviate the sting yet many of us do not take the time to do so for leaders what does this insensitive behavior instill in those around us fear of failure if we know we will be berated for our failures possibly even publicly will we take any risks in our work will we attempt to be innovative or creative will we speak up with ideas and opinions probably not yet failure is an everyday part of our livesat home at work in all of our endeavors it is such a given that the venerable harvard business review devoted its entire april 2011 issue to the subject the cover heading and tagline the failure issue how to understand it learn from it and recover from it not one mention of avoiding it of course we intuitively know that failure is inevitable so why cannot we be more supportive when somebody is suffering through it an executive at a large media company was responsible for launching a new magazine she spent a years worth of time effort and resources trying to get the fledgling publication off the ground but it never flew the magazine had to be cancelled the ceo of the company who could have fired or demoted the executive for the failure or who could have held her up as an example of what not to do instead provided a psychological safety net allowing the executive to save face the ceo stood up at a gathering of the firms top executives and congratulated the failed executive for her courage and skill for doing the wrong thing in the right way he emphasized that the illfated decision was not just hers senior management backed it and the magazine failed despite great content and marketing writes robert sutton in good boss bad boss2 what this ceo epitomized in his actions was a technique that sutton calls forgive and remember a critical path for learning from mistakes and changing behavior the technique was first described by charles l bosk in his book forgive and remember managing medical failure3 the goal is to help individuals achieve accountability while managing the existential problem of failure a demoralizing inner battle for anyone is not this the true responsibility of any leader because if the battle is lost the individual will learn little from the mistake have a diminished selfimage become fearful and contribute less to the success of a company a family or any other organization despite a leaders best efforts those in his care will fail and he will fail recognizing this and the inherent benefits failure may present can help us learn how to help others come through it and land positively and securely on the opposite shore great leaders tap the creative and innovative power of their teams by helping them save face before they have even failed fiona lee amy edmundson and stefan thomke conducted a study with 688 employees in a large health care organization during the rollout of a new data system that integrated and presented data from all departments and divisions within the organization the employees received little training and were told to learn the system by experimenting with it3 the findings in departments where managers specifically told their teams that making mistakes was okay and did not set up reward systems that penalized people who did make mistakes experimentation with the system was much greater in departments where managers were inconsistent in their messages or punished failure even subtly employees experimented with the system much less in fact lowerstatus employees in those departments did not use the system at all because of their greater fear of failure as you might expect the employees who experimented the most with the new more efficient system became the most proficient with it and used it regularly in their everyday work what the supportive managers were actually developing within their team members even if only on a small scale was resilience resilience explains martin p seligman author and positive psychology pioneer is the difference in the ways people respond to failure in his books and other writings he describes how some people bounce back from failure learning and growing from the experience while others languish becoming selfcritical and fearful of the future which would you rather foster in the people in your life companies who recruit from the military have learned the value of resilience well they recognize that people in the military are used to dealing with mistakes and failures sometimes on an almost momentbymoment basis and moving forward purposefully despite them donovan campbell author of joker one a memoir about his experience as a platoon leader in iraq is part of pepsicos elite leadership development program he explains the perspective he gained while commanding a platoon in school you are rewarded for not making mistakes and then you get out and get a job and a lot of times you get promoted because you make very few mistakes and so what you do is you develop a mindset that mistakes are to be avoided at all costs what you learn in the military is that it does not matter how hard you try or how good you are one you will make mistakes and two sometimes events or the enemy or a changing situation will mean that you do not succeed and in fact you fail and you become comfortable with the idea4 this mature approach to failure as opposed to being frozen in a state of indecisiveness or inaction is what we want from our employees and our leaders making it safe for them to fail is a sure way to ensure that they will more readily admit their mistakes which is a key aspect of leadership we have explored more quickly recover from them more fully learn from them as a leader you will gain a more complete picture of their work and become a better coach and mentor for it so how do we create this type of environment charlene li in her important book open leadership maps out five actions that leaders can take to instill organizational resilience within their teams  acknowledge that failure happens leaders can acknowledge failures quickly when they happen but they can also discuss with their teams the likelihood of failures occurring  encourage dialogue to foster trust honestly discussing problems is the best way to learn from them and to trim the seedlings before they become fully grown catastrophes  separate the person from the failure rather than saying you failed say the project failed in most cases that is the truth amy edmondson harvard professor and researcher explored this point with executives when i ask executives to    estimate how many of the failures in their organizations are truly blameworthy their answers are usually in single digitsperhaps 2 to 5 but when i ask how many are treated as blameworthy they say after a pause or a laugh 70 to 90 the unfortunate consequence is that many failures go unreported and their lessons are lost5  learn from your mistakes otherwise they are lost opportunities for learning and for coaching  create a risktaking and failure system being methodical about how we approach risk and failure can help mitigate some of the emotional responses to it why go to these lengths alberto alessi the great italian designer described his companys approach to design as an effort to find the borderline between what is possible and what is not possible and design along it the best designs are those that fall right on the edge of the borderline just this side of possible that is the space of innovation the space where we test our talents and grow as individuals of course hugging the line means that you will often flop over ityou will fall into the realm of the impossible and fail but what a glorious failure it will be and who knows what might be learned from it famed vacuum cleaner designer sir richard dyson produced more than five thousand prototypes before bringing his first product to market what we must remember when faced with a person who has made a mistake is that how he handles it is dependent on the support he receives while living through the tough moment and learning from it a primary difference between ordinary and extraordinary people is how they perceive and respond to failure a good leader can influence which camp we fall into now there are mistakes and then there are mistakes some mistakes come about from minor lapses in judgment from inexperience from the need for coaching these are actual mistakes others come about from recklessness greed a lack of concern for others wellbeing and a desire to elevate oneself at the expense of others in these instances its highly likely that the person at fault actually feels no remorse no sense of accountability is it appropriate to help such an individual save face possibly not if the mistake and attitude are severe enough its likely that helping the other person save face would just exacerbate the problem in these instances its best to keep public comments to a minimum and use private conversations to address the severity of the issue as deftly as possible other than creating an environment in which people are not pilloried for their mistakes when part of a larger whole charlene lis advice can be transferred to situations when we should help an individual save face to recover from a minor error oversight or gaffe  acknowledge that a mistake was made but do it gently pretending that nothing happened certainly meets the forgive criteria but it seems a little disingenuous when the error was blatant  recognize and address your own role even if minor  focus on what was gained  when appropriate to do so without making others culpable address the issue from a broad perspective imagine that you are at a function and are introduced to somebody you have met before but he clearly does not remember you you could say we have met before throwing his error in his face or you could say oh hello mark its nice to see you again did i see you at the better business bureau lunch last month it was a great networking event although there were so many people it was a bit overwhelming today our faults missteps and outright failures are so much more public than they once were when an employee makes a mistake its not surprising when a customer starts blogging about it posts the experience on her facebook page or shoots off a quick email tirade to the ceo of the company the employee is already in a position to feel humiliated and fearful why make it worse allowing others to save face is crucial in the digital age of course helping someone save face is sometimes more difficult to do because his failures have been broadcast it is important to maintain strict discipline in terms of what you write in emails an email accidentally sent to the wrong person or hacked and posted on a blog may not only because embarrassment but also ruin somebody is professional reputation if you need to discuss a mistake or gaffe that somebody made its best to do it in person or over the phone save your written communication for praise and constructive advice while its important to help others weather their failures gracefully helping a customer or potential customer save face can be useful as a business tactic wolfgang schmidt explained how his company rubbermaid uses the technique to win new customers we do get complaints about half those complaints come about as a result of a consumer buying a product thinking its ours but its a competitors product so the consumer writes to us our policy is simply to write a personal letter and say we can understand how you made the mistake because we have these competitors who copy our products you made an honest mistake but we would like for you to see directly the difference in value so try one of ours for free we send them our replacement product for whatever it is they complained about and we think that is a wonderful way to communicate very credibly the story of rubbermaid value6 even if the other person is wrong we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face we do nothing to change his or her behavior on the other hand when we mitigate fault we not only save the other persons psyche we build confidence and trust into our relationship with that person save someone is face once and your influence with him rises save his face every time you can and there is practically nothing he will not do for you   6magnify improvement one bright day in 2010 the hotel company best western created a special facebook page visitors flocked to it hundreds of messages were posted to the wall wallace makes weary travelers feel like they are coming home the best thing about the hotel lobby is his smile wallace is the best we love going back just to visit with him upon leaving the kids asked when we were coming back to see wallace i may pass him in the lobby or the hall fifteen times in a visit and every time he has a great big smile and something fun to say he is one of the greatest parts of my visits we should all relate to one another as wallace does if he ever has a bad day you would not know it in all of my travels i have never encountered anyone more kind and helpful more eager to make a guest feel welcome my day is always made brighter by seeing wallace his always warm welcome his knowledge of the city his kindness and professionalism and that terrific smile make my stay so enjoyable    he has a special gift for connecting with people who is this wallace wallace popechicago native single dad longtime employee of best western river north hotel and a man who loves helping others when wallace was nominated for the stars of the industry award from the illinois hotel and lodging association best western was determined to show its pride and supportand to help him win1 so the company created a facebook page called wallace should win and encouraged visitors to the hotel to go to the page and share their stories of wallaces customer service skills the page had 2722 visits within the first week heartfelt stories of love and support poured in from the hotels customers wallaces genuine kindness and his ability to improve customers travel and personal outlook were lauded again and again and while wallace did not win the award the praise and encouragement he gained from the facebook page was far more meaningful than a plaque praise and encouragement the two essential elements of motivating any person to fulfill their potential to improve or to tackle change yet its difficult for many of us to recognize the efforts of those around us dr gerald graham was curious about what managers could do to better motivate employees so he surveyed fifteen hundred employees and the results were rather shocking  58 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise from their manager  76 percent reported that they seldom if ever received written thanks  81 percent reported that they seldom if ever received praise in public and yet praise from a manager written thanks and public praise were three of the top five motivators among the surveyed employees2 these results were from 1982 decades later things have not changed all that much employees who receive frequent praise are still more productive and organizations in which employees receive frequent praise are universally more successful its one of the twelve indicators of success that marcus buckingham and curt koffman outline in first break all the rules indicators based on extensive gallup organization research yet managers are still notoriously bad at delivering praise we all crave appreciation we all desire to feel important and when we have improved in some way or performed well receiving praise sends a clear message that others have noticed and that it makes a difference this is true at work at home at school in our communities one of the basic psychological tenets of human behavior is that we persist in behaviors for which we are praised those behaviors that are not positively recognized are likely to fall by the wayside the center for management and organization effectiveness offers the following advice for praising those around you3 1 deliver praise from your heart be genuine and sincere 2 deliver praise as soon as possible do not wait for the next meeting performance review family meal or church gathering by then the persons own joy at the success has dissipated and you have lost an opportunity to amplify that joy 3 make praise specific a simple thankyou is not praise it is politeness to feel that their efforts are heading them down the path you want them to go people need to know exactly what you valued in their effort 4 praise people publicly in this era of social technology praising publicly gets easier every day so there is no real excuse not to do it best western certainly did today you do not have to wait for the next quarterly meeting to recognize a job well done we should strive to praise as often as possible most of us do not have to struggle to find opportunities to do so we simply have to take advantage of the opportunities that exist every day captain abrashoff of the uss benfold understood the power of praise better than most most of my young sailors came from hardscrabble backgrounds and had struggled to make it into the navy i put myself in their parents shoes and imagined how they would feel if they got letters from their kids commanding officer and i imagined how the kids would feel when their parents told them i began writing letters to the parents especially when their sons or daughters did something i could honestly praise when the letters arrived the parents invariably called their children to say how proud they were of them4 one sailor was part of a team that had performed very well but was himself not a star captain abrashoff recognized that praising his accomplishments as part of a team would give this sailor the boost he most likely needed so he sent the letter of praise to the young mans parents two weeks later the sailor knocked on captain abrashoffs door with tears streaming down his face i just got a call from my father who all my life told me i am a failure this time he said hes just read your letter and he wanted to congratulate me and say how proud he was of me its the first time in my entire life hes actually encouraged me obviously this was a powerful moment for this young man how do you think it affected his view of what he could achieve and his level of devotion to the success of his team praise while powerful and necessary also implies evaluation against some standard what great leaders and those with influence recognize is that the rest of the time we must use encouragement praise is given only when one achieves good results encouragement can be given any time even when things go poorly5 that is the essence of encouragementshowing your belief in the talents skills and inherent abilities of another person because she exists regardless of how things are going right now being encouraging requires a special attitude when you look at another person rather than seeing her faults you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities what she is capable of insincere encouragement without the strength of your genuine faith in the other person only belittles her efforts what does encouragement foster in the other person psychological hardinessthe ability to weather the stressful and anxietyinducing challenges that we encounter every day to face those challenges and move forward in spite of them to pick ourselves up and keep going keep trying it is the hallmark of positive successful people encouragement provides motivation and finding ways to motivate is a huge struggle for leaders in all areas of life the primary because of that struggle many of us do not take the time to consider what actually motivates people we often assume that people want material rewards that the carrotandstick approach is the best approachbut this is rarely the case people are genuinely more motivated by personal and social encouragement than by material rewards through his research on healthy marriages and families author and psychologist jon carlson defined some essential practices that we can use to create an encouraging environment6 1 make healthy relationships a priority respect and positive communication are two key elements of making that happen 2 practice encouragement daily do not wait until somebody has stumbled on the path toward a goal recognize every effort and every improvement even if it is slight to let them know that your faith in them is unwavering 3 be inclusive for instance include others in your decisionmaking process whenever possible it shows your faith in their sound judgment 4 do not let conflicts fester when were in conflict mode its easy to slip into discouraging or belittling dialogue compare i think you can do it and looks like we have problemwhat should we do about it with just let me take care of this or i told you to be careful 5 have fun clarence m jones a carnegie institute instructor told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct completely changed the life of his son my son david who was then fifteen years old came to live with me in cincinnati he had led a rough life in 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident leaving a very bad scar on his forehead in 1960 his mother and i were divorced and he moved to dallas texas with his mother he had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow learners possibly because of the scar school administrators had decided he was braininjured and could not function at a normal level he was two years behind his age group so he was only in the seventh grade yet he did not know his multiplication tables added on his fingers and could barely read there was one positive point he loved to work on radio and tv sets he wanted to become a tv technician i encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training i decided to help him become proficient in this subject we obtained four sets of flash cards multiplication division addition and subtraction as we went through the cards we put the correct answers in a discard stack when david missed one i gave him the correct answer and then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no more cards left i made a big deal out of each card he got right particularly if he had missed it previously each night we would go through the repeat stack until there were no cards left each night we timed the exercise with a stopwatch i promised him that when he could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers we would quit doing it every night this seemed an impossible goal to david the first night it took 52 minutes the second night 48 then 45 44 41 then under 40 minutes we celebrated each reduction id call in my wife and we would both hug him and wed all dance a jig at the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes when he made a small improvement he would ask to do it again he had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun naturally his grades in algebra took a jump it is amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply he astonished himself by bringing home a b in math that had never happened before other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity his reading improved rapidly and he began to use his natural talents in drawing later in the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit he chose to develop a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of levers it required skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied mathematics the exhibit took first prize in his schools science fair and was entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of cincinnati that did it here was a kid who had flunked two grades who had been told he was braindamaged who had been called frankenstein by his classmates and told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his head suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things the result from the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through high school he never failed to make the honor roll in high school he was elected to the national honor society once he found learning was easy his whole life changed tell someone that you have total faith in his ability to accomplish a goal and encourage him by highlighting all of the skills he possesses that will help him along the way and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel remember abilities wither under criticism and blossom under encouragement magnify improvement and you maximize others talents   7give others a fine reputation to live up to benjamin zander was tiredtired of watching his conservatory students so anxious about the grading of their performances in his class take a safe approach to their music education in the top tiers of the arts world bitter competition can define the talent development process he considered abandoning grades altogether but that presented a host of challenges not the least of which was getting the head of the school to approve such a radical move instead he decided he would give each student an aon the very first day of class upon meeting his new and nervous students he would say each student in this class will get an a for the course however there is one requirement that you must fulfill to earn this grade some time during the next two weeks you must write me a letter dated next may    and in this letter you are to tell in as much detail as you can the story of what will have happened to you by next may that is in line with this extraordinary grade he instructed the students to think of themselves in the future looking back on all that they had done to earn such an illustrious grade they were to discuss insights milestones and even competitions won but zander wanted more than a surface analysis i am especially interested in the person you will have become by next may i am interested in the attitude feelings and worldview of that person who will have done all she wished to do or become everything he wanted to be he would say to them1 what did he get from his students consider the following letter from a young trombonist dear mr z today the world knows me that drive of energy and intense emotion that you saw twisting and dormant inside me yet alas i could not show in performance or conversation was freed tonight in a program of new music composed for me    the concert ended and no one stirred a pregnant quiet sighs and then applause that drowned my hearts throbbing i might have bowedi cannot remember now the clapping sustained such that i thought i might make my debut complete and celebrate the shedding of the mask and

transform themselves in astounding ways he calls his approach giving an a in his book the art of possibility coauthored with his wife rosamund stone zander he has this to say about its potential to foster greatness in an individual an a can be given to anyone in any walk of lifeto a waitress to your employer to your motherinlaw to the members of the opposite team and to the other drivers in traffic when you give an a you find yourself speaking to people not from a place of measuring how they stack up against your standards but from a place of respect that gives them room to realize themselves    this a is not an expectation to live up to but a possibility to live into2 what a magical perspective to assume in an often cynical world coaches mentors leaders and parents often find that people live up to our expectations of them no matter how diminished those expectations are if a man feels unimportant or disrespected he will have little motivation for improving himself so why not create a vision of him that embodies everything you know he is capable of achieving as well as everything you do not know about his possibilities you will rarely be disappointed paige ann michelle mccabes mother described her own adventures in creating a biggirl reputation for her daughter fouryearold paige ann michelle mccabe was sitting on one of our kitchen stools when she heard me tell her sixyearold brother brandon that it was now his responsibility to set the table each night before dinner paige looked hopeful and almost teary what am i big enough to do now mummy what can i do because i am big too not wanting to break her little heart or deflate her ego i searched quickly for something that she could take responsibility for an idea crept into my head just in time paige ann michelle i announced triumphantly now that you are four years old and old enough to make proper choices you are responsible for choosing your clothes for the next day each night before you take a bath you should get your clothes out of your drawer and put them on the bed ready to wear in the morning when you wake up the house was a flurry of activity brandon was zooming around setting the table and paige ran straight to her room where i could hear drawers and cupboards hurriedly opening and closing about ten seconds later she ran out to report her success look mummy i did it i got them out come and see come and see sure enough the clothes were laid out on the bed ready to go i told her how proud i was now that she was growing up and had her very own job to do and she beamed the next morning a miracle occurred in the mccabe house usually mummy has to coax a grumpy paige out of bed and getting her dressed is difficult to say the least if i choose a blue skirt she wants to wear red pants if i choose a white shirt with butterflies she wants to wear the purple shirt with flowers on it finally when i give in and tell her to choose she takes forever paige stays grumpy and i end up frustrated but not that morning look what i am wearing mummy she said she had got herself dressed before i had asked her to i kissed her proudly and told her how happy i was with her choices it was morning and paige ann michelle mccabe was happy what a difference that made paige ann michelle mccabe had lived up to the fine reputation of a grownup fouryearold that had been bestowed upon her to change somebody is behavior change the level of respect she receives by giving her a fine reputation to live up to act as though the trait you are trying to influence is already one of the persons outstanding characteristics   8stay connected on common ground the employees of a manufacturing company had been on strike for six months when a labor contract was finally agreed upon the terms however were less than what the employees had originally asked for while the employees did return to work tensions were running high on both sides the working environment was toxic how could they get past the animosity and move forward in crucial conversations authors kerry patterson joseph grenny ron mcmillan and al switzer described how they worked with the two groups to build bridges they instructed each group to spend time considering their goals for the company and to write them out on postersized paper each group spent two hours discussing their goals then wrote the goals on the paper and posted it on the wall in the room they were in the coaches then asked the teams to switch rooms and to review the other groups goals with the purpose of finding at least some morsel of common ground what do you think happened when the two groups returned to the meeting room they were amazed their goals were almost identical a profitable company stable and rewarding jobs highquality products and a positive impact on the community1 while this revelation did not erase the past it provided each group with a new perspective on the other they learned something about each other that would make it easier to reach more positive outcomes in the future why is common ground so important for a leader to effectively influence anothers attitude or behavior he needs to overcome any potential resistance by making the person feel glad to do what is being asked we are not talking about manipulation or mind control here if you consider what the others goals are and how to connect your goals to hers you will create a winwin situation that will make everybody glad it is amazing how simple it is today to find a connection with another when we take the time to if you go on an interview or a sales call would not you spend time researching the company discovering its vision its stated goals its values all of this is information that many companies post front and center on their websites and many go much further posting employee bios press releases and updated information on their blogs yet we often do not take the time to make these same inroads with those in our lives those standing right in front of us even though it is just as easy ask people what they did over the weekend what they hope to do for their next vacation or what books they have recently read and you will discover something compelling and revealing about their goals their dreams and if you are connected with them online it may be even easier six degrees to kevin bacon is an interesting pop culture phenomenon but its actually a fantastic way to think about those you want to influence when you expand the translation to include common interests common experiences common goals the truth is that we are only one degree away from anyone to be influential with others to make them happy to do what it is we would like them to do we simply have to find that one degree that connects us one student of the dale carnegie training institute in germany discovered that taking the bold path of simply writing to those people she wanted to learn more aboutto possibly find that one degree of connectionproduced wondrous results as i was very shy i decided to write emails to the people i was interested in i researched and found the addresses of very famous and wellknown people and started to ask them questions about their backgrounds such as how they got started in their businesses and what was important to them personally two weeks later i received a twopaged letter from the german president johannes rau who answered my questions six weeks later i received another letter it was a big envelope and a book was enclosed that would answer my questions it was sent to me by his holiness the dalai lama what did this person learn if you make the effort peopleall people even those who seem unapproachablewill tell you their stories their motivations and their goals one night dana white the president of the ultimate fighting championship sports league accidentally tweeted his direct phone number to more than one million fans who retweeted it to untold numbers of people the fans began calling within minutes a leader less focused on making his customers happy would have called the phone company and had his number changed immediately but that is not what dana white did for more than an hour and a half he took the calls that came in and talked to the fans they loved it it was a fortunate mistake and dana white learned a lot from it he learned that talking to fans was valuable and the pr company that helps manage ufcs online presence learned that they had a new opportunity to provide value to fans when where and how they want to receive it2 now dana white has a dedicated line that he uses to take calls from fans its posted on all of his social media outlets when he has time he let us them know hes ready to talk and the phone starts ringing his accidental ninety minutes on the phone with ufc fans from all over the world was no gimmick and that is key to ultimate fighting being the fastestgrowing sport in the world according to mashables greg ferenstein3 white has been passionate about connecting with fans through social media from the start and relied on the grassroots support of his fans when major media refused to cover ufc events when he hired digital royalty to grow ufcs online presence and train the fighters in social media techniques he told the fighters i want you to tweet your asses off the secret of his success in connecting with his fans he is brutally honest and frank to prove the power of this connection to a companion white left a restaurant and walked to a nearby gas station at eleventhirty at night he tweeted his location within three minutes there were about one hundred fans there in his analysis of dana whites efforts greg ferenstein wrote transparency outreach and openness are now more important than ever as social media allows fans to subvert traditional channels and voice their opinions directly white is willing to meet them halfway foregoing false showmanship in order to genuinely connect with fans while social media is a great tool for learning what drives somebody it is only a tool what leaders need to foster within themselves is a genuine desire to ascertain the answer and then to act on the information a desire that many failed executives undermine both knowingly and unknowingly of this depreciated desire among many highpowered executives derailed author dr tim irwin concludes just as humility seems to be at the epicenter of leadership effectiveness arrogance is commonly at the root of a leaders undoing    and ours    arrogance takes many forms the most rudimentary is the selfcentered focus that fosters a belief that i am central to the viability of the organization the department or the team the resulting dismissiveness of others contributions is inevitable when arrogance blossoms into hubris a sense of entitlement results this place cannot function without me and i deserve special perks arrogant leaders also seem to eschew feedback so beneficial to any leader they become truthstarved4 a contrasting approach is found in yvon chouinard cofounder with his wife malinda of patagonia and author of let my people go surfing yvon is proud of the fact that patagonia hires the intensely independentpeople who would be considered unemployable in a typical company hes been told by organizational consultants while he revels in his independentminded employees it also presents a management challenge how to build a collaborative unit all focused on the same goals one tool he uses is the design of the offices no one has a private office in our company and everyone works in open rooms with no doors or separations including yvon and malinda what we lose in quiet thinking space is more than made up for with better communication and an egalitarian atmosphere5 now take it a step further and consider admiral janitorial services the fictional company described in matthew kellys the dream manager turnover is high and costly not surprising for a company staffed by transient workers what to do first find out their biggest struggle the company assumes that the biggest because of turnover is pay but when it surveys the employees it discovers that their biggest struggle is transportation many rely on public transportation which is spotty and even dangerous at night what should the leaders of the company do they provide shuttle service its costly but what they save in turnover costs more than makes up for it employees stay twice as long sick days have dropped and morale is higher still the leaders know they could do better what really makes people leave they wonder the jobs are deadend ones not dreamfulfilling positions and everybody knows it the leaders decide that they cannot fix that but they can find ways to help employees move closer to their dreams while they work for admiral so they ask the employees what are your dreams surprisingly or maybe not the employees tell them now the company has powerful informationand it uses it to help the employees achieve their dreams one employee wants to learn spanish another who happens to be a spanish speaker wants to teach so the company connects them yes this story is fictional but does the example seem extreme why should not we know what our colleagues coworkers friends and family members dream how powerful that information would be how central that information would be for sustaining a course whereby you and those in your sphere of influence achieve what is desired do you know what motivates the people around you there are simple ways to find out and once you have the information it is a simple process to link your desired outcomes with their goals 1 be sincere do not promise anything that you cannot deliver 2 be empathetic ask yourself what it is the other person really wants 3 consider the benefits the person will receive from doing what you suggest 4 match those benefits to the other persons wants 5 when you make your request put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit the more you know of others and the more they know of you the easier it will be to find common ground on which to base all future creativity and collaboration staying connected with customers in the digital world says richard branson the virgin group mogul recently voted most influential british business figure is keeping many executives awake at night how companies adapt to this energetic and sometimes chaotic world will define their future success the website facebook page blog and twitter feed are no longer addons to a businesss communication budget they should be central to its marketing strategy and used in coordination with other marketing efforts6 the key says branson is not defaulting your digital media into mere transactional mode instead open them wide for ongoing communication as well we now live in a connected world where the idea of companies and customers being instantly and constantly in touch is not an exception its the expectation the rise of social media writes branson has presented exciting challenges and caused us to question our usual ways of doing business    to succeed such efforts must be supported from the top david cush ceo of virgin america freed up the management of these social media channels from the companys classic hierarchy his social media team is made up of 20somethings who have been given broad guidelines and then let loose these digital natives at virgin have employed facebook and twitter as part of the companys communication strategy this open digital connection allowed for a unique connection opportunity that flowed into a successful marketing campaign many west coast animal shelters were bursting at the seams with chihuahuas and something needed to be done to give the little dogs a better chance to find good homes the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals intervened contacting virgin america and asking if the airline would help fly several dogs from san francisco to new york virgin immediately agreed and even volunteered crew members to accompany the small passengers virgins digital team promoted this story through all their communication channels it went viral explains branson and also sparked the interest of the traditional mediadrawing attention to the aspca and virgin atlantics efforts to help we then used the story as the basis of a very successful online sale on flights to mexico the traditional roles of advertising marketing and customer relations have changed so too has the role of todays leader in digital time and space with open access and frequent communication the perfunctory principles of corporate activity have largely broken down and been replaced by the basic principles of human relations if you do not know how to win friends and influence people in a genuine and positive manner today not only will you have trouble keeping pace in a marketplace ruled by the consumer you will also have trouble keeping your people employed long gone are the days when leaders can lord it over their reports from behind closed doors in topfloor offices accessible only by private elevators in truth those days never existed where effective leadership is concernednot in 1936 and not now today with fulltime connectivity as the norm the consequences of remote leadership are more palpable physical proximity is not the main issue relational proximity is while an individual can only occasionally maintain a productive progressive relationship without a reasonable measure of physical presence no person in the worldespecially a leadercan maintain progressive influence without relational proximity it is true that the world is now open for business but your first task remains the business of humanity the greatest endeavors are and always will be interdependent and interactive in the end the art of winning friends and influencing people in the digital age is summed up in the activity of connecting and staying connected on common ground   notes why carnegies advice still matters 1 james thurber friends romans countrymen lend me your earmuffs in lanterns and lances new york

/home/jeff/Downloads/QuantumPlotBertBooks/The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life (Mark Manson) (z-lib.org).epub,"""               chapter 1 do not try charles bukowski was an alcoholic a womanizer a chronic gambler a lout a cheapskate a deadbeat and on his worst days a poet hes probably the last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in any sort of selfhelp book which is why hes the perfect place to start bukowski wanted to be a writer but for decades his work was rejected by almost every magazine newspaper journal agent and publisher he submitted to his work was horrible they said crude disgusting depraved and as the stacks of rejection slips piled up the weight of his failures pushed him deep into an alcoholfueled depression that would follow him for most of his life bukowski had a day job as a letterfiler at a post office he got paid shit money and spent most of it on booze he gambled away the rest at the racetrack at night he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry on his beatup old typewriter often he would wake up on the floor having passed out the night before thirty years went by like this most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol drugs gambling and prostitutes then when bukowski was fifty after a lifetime of failure and selfloathing an editor at a small independent publishing house took a strange interest in him the editor could not offer bukowski much money or much promise of sales but he had a weird affection for the drunk loser so he decided to take a chance on him it was the first real shot bukowski had ever gotten and he realized probably the only one he would ever get bukowski wrote back to the editor i have one of two choicesstay in the post office and go crazy    or stay out here and play at writer and starve i have decided to starve upon signing the contract bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks it was called simply post office in the dedication he wrote dedicated to nobody bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet he would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of poems selling over two million copies of his books his popularity defied everyone is expectations particularly his own stories like bukowskis are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative bukowskis life embodies the american dream a man fights for what he wants never gives up and eventually achieves his wildest dreams its practically a movie waiting to happen we all look at stories like bukowskis and say see he never gave up he never stopped trying he always believed in himself he persisted against all the odds and made something of himself it is then strange that on bukowskis tombstone the epitaph reads do not try see despite the book sales and the fame bukowski was a loser he knew it and his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner but from the fact that he knew he was a loser accepted it and then wrote honestly about it he never tried to be anything other than what he was the genius in bukowskis work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light it was the opposite it was his simple ability to be completely unflinchingly honest with himselfespecially the worst parts of himselfand to share his failings without hesitation or doubt this is the real story of bukowskis success his comfort with himself as a failure bukowski did not give a fuck about success even after his fame he still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in his audience he still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every woman he could find fame and success did not make him a better person nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful selfimprovement and success often occur together but that does not necessarily mean they are the same thing our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations be happier be healthier be the best better than the rest be smarter faster richer sexier more popular more productive more envied and more admired be perfect and amazing and crap out twelvekaratgold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfieready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that is likely to save the planet one day but when you stop and really think about it conventional life adviceall the positive and happy selfhelp stuff we hear all the timeis actually fixating on what you lack it lasers in on what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be and then emphasizes them for you you learn about the best ways to make money because you feel you do not have enough money already you stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you are beautiful because you feel as though you are not beautiful already you follow dating and relationship advice because you feel that you are unlovable already you try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful because you feel as though you are not successful enough already ironically this fixation on the positiveon what is better what is superioronly serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not of what we lack of what we should have been but failed to be after all no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she is happy she just is there is a saying in texas the smallest dog barks the loudest a confident man does not feel a need to prove that hes confident a rich woman does not feel a need to convince anybody that she is rich either you are or you are not and if you are dreaming of something all the time then you are reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over that you are not that everyone and their tv commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job or a more rugged car or a prettier girlfriend or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids the world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more more morebuy more own more make more fuck more be more you are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything all the time give a fuck about a new tv give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick why my guess because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business and while there is nothing wrong with good business the problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health it causes you to become overly attached to the superficial and fake to dedicate your life to chasing a mirage of happiness and satisfaction the key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more its giving a fuck about less giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important the feedback loop from hell there is an insidious quirk to your brain that if you let it can drive you absolutely batty tell me if this sounds familiar to you you get anxious about confronting somebody in your life that anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you are so anxious now you are becoming anxious about being anxious oh no doubly anxious now you are anxious about your anxiety which is causing more anxiety quick where is the whiskey or let us say you have an anger problem you get pissed off at the stupidest most inane stuff and you have no idea why and the fact that you get pissed off so easily starts to piss you off even more and then in your petty rage you realize that being angry all the time makes you a shallow and mean person and you hate this you hate it so much that you get angry at yourself now look at you you are angry at yourself getting angry about being angry fuck you wall here have a fist or you are so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you are worrying or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you are feeling or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about it welcome to the feedback loop from hell chances are you have engaged in it more than a few times maybe you are engaging in it right now god i do the feedback loop all the timeim such a loser for doing it i should stop oh my god i feel like such a loser for calling myself a loser i should stop calling myself a loser ah fuck i am doing it again see i am a loser argh calm down amigo believe it or not this is part of the beauty of being human very few animals on earth have the ability to think cogent thoughts to begin with but we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts about our thoughts so i can think about watching miley cyrus videos on youtube and then immediately think about what a sicko i am for wanting to watch miley cyrus videos on youtube ah the miracle of consciousness now here is the problem our society today through the wonders of consumer culture and heylookmylifeiscoolerthanyours social media has bred a whole generation of people who believe that having these negative experiencesanxiety fear guilt etcis totally not okay i mean if you look at your facebook feed everybody there is having a fucking grand old time look eight people got married this week and some sixteenyearold on tv got a ferrari for her birthday and another kid just made two billion dollars inventing an app that automatically delivers you more toilet paper when you run out meanwhile you are stuck at home flossing your cat and you cannot help but think your life sucks even more than you thought the feedback loop from hell has become a borderline epidemic making many of us overly stressed overly neurotic and overly selfloathing back in grandpas day he would feel like shit and think to himself gee whiz i sure do feel like a cow turd today but hey i guess that is just life back to shoveling hay but now now if you feel like shit for even five minutes you are bombarded with 350 images of people totally happy and having amazing fucking lives and its impossible to not feel like there is something wrong with you its this last part that gets us into trouble we feel bad about feeling bad we feel guilty for feeling guilty we get angry about getting angry we get anxious about feeling anxious what is wrong with me this is why not giving a fuck is so key this is why its going to save the world and its going to save it by accepting that the world is totally fucked and that is all right because its always been that way and always will be by not giving a fuck that you feel bad you shortcircuit the feedback loop from hell you say to yourself i feel like shit but who gives a fuck and then as if sprinkled by magic fuckgiving fairy dust you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad george orwell said that to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle well the solution to our stress and anxiety is right there in front of our noses and were too busy watching porn and advertisements for ab machines that do not work wondering why were not banging a hot blonde with a rocking sixpack to notice we joke online about firstworld problems but we really have become victims of our own success stressrelated health issues anxiety disorders and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years despite the fact that everyone has a flatscreen tv and can have their groceries delivered our crisis is no longer material its existential its spiritual we have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we do not even know what to give a fuck about anymore because there is an infinite amount of things we can now see or know there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we do not measure up that were not good enough that things are not as great as they could be and this rips us apart inside because here is the thing that is wrong with all of the how to be happy shit that is been shared eight million times on facebook in the past few yearsheres what nobody realizes about all of this crap the desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience and paradoxically the acceptance of ones negative experience is itself a positive experience this is a total mindfuck so ill give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again wanting positive experience is a negative experience accepting negative experience is a positive experience its what the philosopher alan watts used to refer to as the backwards lawthe idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time the less satisfied you become as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place the more you desperately want to be rich the more poor and unworthy you feel regardless of how much money you actually make the more you desperately want to be sexy and desired the uglier you come to see yourself regardless of your actual physical appearance the more you desperately want to be happy and loved the lonelier and more afraid you become regardless of those who surround you the more you want to be spiritually enlightened the more selfcentered and shallow you become in trying to get there its like this one time i tripped on acid and it felt like the more i walked toward a house the farther away the house got from me and yes i just used my lsd hallucinations to make a philosophical point about happiness no fucks given as the existential philosopher albert camus said and i am pretty sure he was not on lsd at the time you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life or put more simply do not try now i know what you are saying mark this is making my nipples all hard but what about the camaro i have been saving up for what about the beach body i have been starving myself for after all i paid a lot of money for that ab machine what about the big house on the lake i have been dreaming of if i stop giving a fuck about those thingswell then ill never achieve anything i do not want that to happen do i so glad you asked ever notice that sometimes when you care less about something you do better at it notice how its often the person who is the least invested in the success of something that actually ends up achieving it notice how sometimes when you stop giving a fuck everything seems to fall into place what is with that what is interesting about the backwards law is that its called backwards for a reason not giving a fuck works in reverse if pursuing the positive is a negative then pursuing the negative generates the positive the pain you pursue in the gym results in better allaround health and energy the failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what is necessary to be successful being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others the pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance seriously i could keep going but you get the point everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience any attempt to escape the negative to avoid it or quash it or silence it only backfires the avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering the avoidance of struggle is a struggle the denial of failure is a failure hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life and to tear it out is not only impossible but destructive attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it to try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain in contrast if you are able to not give a fuck about the pain you become unstoppable in my life i have given a fuck about many things i have also not given a fuck about many things and like the road not taken it was the fucks not given that made all the difference chances are you know somebody in your life who at one time or another did not give a fuck and then went on to accomplish amazing feats perhaps there was a time in your own life when you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary height for myself quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks to start an internet business ranks pretty high up there in my own did not give a fuck hall of fame same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to south america fucks given none just went and did it these moments of nonfuckery are the moments that most define our lives the major switch in careers the spontaneous choice to drop out of college and join a rock band the decision to finally dump that deadbeat boyfriend whom you caught wearing your pantyhose a few too many times to not give a fuck is to stare down lifes most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface its a whole new bag of burritos under the hood i do not even know what that sentence means but i do not give a fuck a bag of burritos sounds awesome so let us just go with it most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given we give too many fucks about the rude gas station attendant who gave us our change in nickels we give too many fucks when a show we liked was canceled on tv we give too many fucks when our coworkers do not bother asking us about our awesome weekend meanwhile our credit cards are maxed out our dog hates us and junior is snorting meth in the bathroom yet were getting pissed off about nickels and everybody loves raymond look this is how it works you are going to die one day i know that is kind of obvious but i just wanted to remind you in case you would forgotten you and everyone you know are going to be dead soon and in the short amount of time between here and there you have a limited amount of fucks to give very few in fact and if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choicewell then you are going to get fucked there is a subtle art to not giving a fuck and though the concept may sound ridiculous and i may sound like an asshole what i am talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectivelyhow to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values this is incredibly difficult it takes a lifetime of practice and discipline to achieve and you will regularly fail but it is perhaps the most worthy struggle one can undertake in ones life it is perhaps the only struggle in ones life because when you give too many fuckswhen you give a fuck about everyone and everythingyou will feel that you are perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be this is a sickness and it will eat you alive you will see every adversity as an injustice every challenge as a failure every inconvenience as a personal slight every disagreement as a betrayal you will be confined to your own petty skullsized hell burning with entitlement and bluster running circles around your very own personal feedback loop from hell in constant motion yet arriving nowhere the subtle art of not giving a fuck when most people envision giving no fucks whatsoever they imagine a kind of serene indifference to everything a calm that weathers all storms they imagine and aspire to be a person who is shaken by nothing and caves in to no one there is a name for a person who finds no emotion or meaning in anything a psychopath why you would want to emulate a psychopath i have no fucking clue so what does not giving a fuck mean let us look at three subtleties that should help clarify the matter subtlety 1 not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent it means being comfortable with being different let us be clear there is absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference people who are indifferent are lame and scared they are couch potatoes and internet trolls in fact indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks they give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair so they never bother washing or combing it they give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas so they hide behind sarcasm and selfrighteous snark they are afraid to let anyone get close to them so they imagine themselves as some special unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices that is why they do not make any meaningful choices they hide in a gray emotionless pit of their own making selfabsorbed and selfpitying perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life because here is a sneaky truth about life there is no such thing as not giving a fuck you must give a fuck about something its part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck the question then is what do we give a fuck about what are we choosing to give a fuck about and how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter my mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers had i been indifferent i would have shrugged my shoulders sipped my mocha and downloaded another season of the wire sorry mom but instead i was indignant i was pissed off i said no screw that mom were going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole why because i do not give a fuck i will ruin this guys life if i have to this illustrates the first subtlety of not giving a fuck when we say damn watch out mark manson just do not give a fuck we do not mean that mark manson does not care about anything on the contrary we mean that mark manson does not care about adversity in the face of his goals he does not care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble we mean that mark manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do he just does not give a fuck this is what is so admirable no not me dumbassthe overcoming adversity stuff the willingness to be different an outcast a pariah all for the sake of ones own values the willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it the people who do not give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times the people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway because they know its right they know its more important than they are more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego they say fuck it not to everything in life but rather to everything unimportant in life they reserve their fucks for what truly matters friends family purpose burritos and an occasional lawsuit or two and because of that because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter people give a fuck about them in return because here is another sneaky little truth about life you cannot be an important and lifechanging presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others you just cannot because there is no such thing as a lack of adversity it does not exist the old saying goes that no matter where you go there you are well the same is true for adversity and failure no matter where you go there is a fivehundredpound load of shit waiting for you and that is perfectly fine the point is not to get away from the shit the point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with subtlety 2 to not give a fuck about adversity you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity imagine you are at a grocery store and you watch an elderly lady scream at the cashier berating him for not accepting her thirtycent coupon why does this lady give a fuck its just thirty cents ill tell you why that lady probably does not have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons she is old and lonely her kids are dickheads and never visit she has not had sex in over thirty years she cannot fart without extreme lowerback pain her pension is on its last legs and she is probably going to die in a diaper thinking she is in candy land so she snips coupons that is all she is got its her and her damn coupons its all she can give a fuck about because there is nothing else to give a fuck about and so when that pimplyfaced seventeenyearold cashier refuses to accept one of them when he defends his cash registers purity the way knights used to defend maidens virginity you can bet granny is going to erupt eighty years of fucks will rain down all at once like a fiery hailstorm of back in my day and people used to show more respect stories the problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they do not have anything more fuckworthy to dedicate their fucks to if you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers youyour exboyfriends new facebook picture how quickly the batteries die in the tv remote missing out on yet another twoforone sale on hand sanitizerchances are you do not have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about and that is your real problem not the hand sanitizer not the tv remote i once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems the mind automatically finds a way to invent some i think what most peopleespecially educated pampered middleclass white peopleconsider life problems are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about it then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy because if you do not find that meaningful something your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes subtlety 3 whether you realize it or not you are always choosing what to give a fuck about people are not just born not giving a fuck in fact were born giving way too many fucks ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue exactly fuck that kid when were young everything is new and exciting and everything seems to matter so much therefore we give tons of fucks we give a fuck about everything and everyoneabout what people are saying about us about whether that cute boygirl called us back or not about whether our socks match or not or what color our birthday balloon is as we get older with the benefit of experience and having seen so much time slip by we begin to notice that most of these sorts of things have little lasting impact on our lives those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best we realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us and we choose not to obsess so much over them essentially we become more selective about the fucks were willing to give this is something called maturity its nice you should try it sometime maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what is truly fuckworthy as bunk moreland said to his partner detective mcnulty in the wire which fuck you i still downloaded that is what you get for giving a fuck when it was not your turn to give a fuck then as we grow older and enter middle age something else begins to change our energy level drops our identity solidifies we know who we are and we accept ourselves including some of the parts we are not thrilled about and in a strange way this is liberating we no longer need to give a fuck about everything life is just what it is we accept it warts and all we realize that were never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel jennifer anistons tits and that is okay life goes on we now reserve our everdwindling fucks for the most truly fuckworthy parts of our lives our families our best friends our golf swing and to our astonishment this is enough this simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis and we start to think maybe that crazy alcoholic bukowski was onto something do not try so mark what the fuck is the point of this book anyway this book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you are choosing to find important in life and what you are choosing to find unimportant i believe that today were facing a psychological epidemic one in which people no longer realize its okay for things to suck sometimes i know that sounds intellectually lazy on the surface but i promise you its a lifedeath sort of issue because when we believe that its not okay for things to suck sometimes then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves we start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing xanax with a vodka chaser on a tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids this belief that its not okay to be inadequate sometimes is the source of the growing feedback loop from hell that is coming to dominate our culture the idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not developing this ability leads to something i like to think of as a kind of practical enlightenment no not that airyfairy eternal bliss endofallsuffering bullshitty kind of enlightenment on the contrary i see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitablethat no matter what you do life is comprised of failures loss regrets and even death because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you and it will throw a lot of shit trust me you become invincible in a sort of lowlevel spiritual way after all the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it this book does not give a fuck about alleviating your problems or your pain and that is precisely why you will know its being honest this book is not some guide to greatnessit could not be because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds a madeup destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue our own psychological atlantis instead this book will turn your pain into a tool your trauma into power and your problems into slightly better problems that is real progress think of it as a guide to suffering and how to do it better more meaningfully with more compassion and more humility its a book about moving lightly despite your heavy burdens resting easier with your greatest fears laughing at your tears as you cry them this book will not teach you how to gain or achieve but rather how to lose and let go it will teach you to take inventory of your life and scrub out all but the most important items it will teach you to close your eyes and trust that you can fall backwards and still be okay it will teach you to give fewer fucks it will teach you to not try     chapter 2 happiness is a problem about twentyfive hundred years ago in the himalayan foothills of presentday nepal there lived in a great palace a king who was going to have a son for this son the king had a particularly grand idea he would make the childs life perfect the child would never know a moment of sufferingevery need every desire would be accounted for at all times the king built high walls around the palace that prevented the prince from knowing the outside world he spoiled the child lavishing him with food and gifts surrounding him with servants who catered to his every whim and just as planned the child grew up ignorant of the routine cruelties of human existence all of the princes childhood went on like this but despite the endless luxury and opulence the prince became kind of a pissedoff young man soon every experience felt empty and valueless the problem was that no matter what his father gave him it never seemed enough never meant anything so late one night the prince snuck out of the palace to see what was beyond its walls he had a servant drive him through the local village and what he saw horrified him for the first time in his life the prince saw human suffering he saw sick people old people homeless people people in pain even people dying the prince returned to the palace and found himself in a sort of existential crisis not knowing how to process what he would seen he got all emo about everything and complained a lot and as is so typical of young men the prince ended up blaming his father for the very things his father had tried to do for him it was the riches the prince thought that had made him so miserable that had made life seem so meaningless he decided to run away but the prince was more like his father than he knew he had grand ideas too he would not just run away he would give up his royalty his family and all of his possessions and live in the streets sleeping in dirt like an animal there he would starve himself torture himself and beg for scraps of food from strangers for the rest of his life the next night the prince snuck out of the palace again this time never to return for years he lived as a bum a discarded and forgotten remnant of society the dog shit caked to the bottom of the social totem pole and as planned the prince suffered greatly he suffered through disease hunger pain loneliness and decay he confronted the brink of death itself often limited to eating a single nut each day a few years went by then a few more and then    nothing happened the prince began to notice that this life of suffering was not all that it was cracked up to be it was not bringing him the insight he had desired it was not revealing any deeper mystery of the world or its ultimate purpose in fact the prince came to know what the rest of us have always kind of known that suffering totally sucks and its not necessarily that meaningful either as with being rich there is no value in suffering when its done without purpose and soon the prince came to the conclusion that his grand idea like his fathers was in fact a fucking terrible idea and he should probably go do something else instead totally confused the prince cleaned himself up and went and found a big tree near a river he decided that he would sit under that tree and not get up until he came up with another grand idea as the legend goes the confused prince sat under that tree for fortynine days we will not delve into the biological viability of sitting in the same spot for fortynine days but let us just say that in that time the prince came to a number of profound realizations one of those realizations was this that life itself is a form of suffering the rich suffer because of their riches the poor suffer because of their poverty people without a family suffer because they have no family people with a family suffer because of their family people who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures people who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention this is not to say that all suffering is equal some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering but we all must suffer nonetheless years later the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world and this would be its first and central tenet that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them the prince would later become known as the buddha and in case you have not heard of him he was kind of a big deal there is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs the premise is that happiness is algorithmic that it can be worked for and earned and achieved as if it were getting accepted to law school or building a really complicated lego set if i achieve x then i can be happy if i look like y then i can be happy if i can be with a person like z then i can be happy this premise though is the problem happiness is not a solvable equation dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and as well see necessary components to creating consistent happiness the buddha argued this from a theological and philosophical perspective i will make the same argument in this chapter but i will make it from a biological perspective and with pandas the misadventures of disappointment panda if i could invent a superhero i would invent one called disappointment panda he would wear a cheesy eye mask and a shirt with a giant capital t on it that was way too small for his big panda belly and his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but did not want to accept he would go doortodoor like a bible salesman and ring doorbells and say things like sure making a lot of money makes you feel good but it will not make your kids love you or if you have to ask yourself if you trust your wife then you probably do not or what you consider friendship is really just your constant attempts to impress people then he would tell the homeowner to have a nice day and saunter on down to the next house it would be awesome and sick and sad and uplifting and necessary after all the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear disappointment panda would be the hero that none of us would want but all of us would need he would be the proverbial vegetables to our mental diet of junk food he would make our lives better despite making us feel worse he would make us stronger by tearing us down brighten our future by showing us the darkness listening to him would be like watching a movie where the hero dies in the end you love it even more despite making you feel horrible because it feels real so while were here allow me to put on my disappointment panda mask and drop another unpleasant truth on you we suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful it is natures preferred agent for inspiring change we have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity because its the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that is going to do the most work to innovate and survive we are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have this constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving building and conquering so noour own pain and misery are not a bug of human evolution they are a feature pain in all of its forms is our bodys most effective means of spurring action take something as simple as stubbing your toe if you are like me when you stub your toe you scream enough fourletter words to make pope francis cry you also probably blame some poor inanimate object for your suffering stupid table you say or maybe you even go so far as to question your entire interior design philosophy based on your throbbing foot what kind of idiot puts a table there anyway seriously but i digress that horrible stubbedtoeinduced pain the one you and i and the pope hate so much exists for an important reason physical pain is a product of our nervous system a feedback mechanism to give us a sense of our own physical proportionswhere we can and cannot move and what we can and cannot touch when we exceed those limits our nervous system duly punishes us to make sure that we pay attention and never do it again and this pain as much as we hate it is useful pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when were young or careless it helps show us what is good for us versus what is bad for us it helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations it teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves or stick metal objects into electrical sockets therefore its not always beneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure since pain can at times be lifeordeath important to our wellbeing but pain is not merely physical as anyone who has had to sit through the first star wars prequel can tell you we humans are capable of experiencing acute psychological pain as well in fact research has found that our brains do not register much difference between physical pain and psychological pain so when i tell you that my first girlfriend cheating on me and leaving me felt like having an ice pick slowly inserted into the center of my heart that is because well it hurt so much i might as well have had an ice pick slowly inserted into the center of my heart like physical pain our psychological pain is an indication of something out of equilibrium some limitation that has been exceeded and like our physical pain our psychological pain is not necessarily always bad or even undesirable in some cases experiencing emotional or psychological pain can be healthy or necessary just like stubbing our toe teaches us to walk into fewer tables the emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future and this is what is so dangerous about a society that coddles itself more and more from the inevitable discomforts of life we lose the benefits of experiencing healthy doses of pain a loss that disconnects us from the reality of the world around us you may salivate at the thought of a problemfree life full of everlasting happiness and eternal compassion but back here on earth the problems never cease seriously problems do not end disappointment panda just dropped by we had margaritas and he told me all about it problems never fucking go away he saidthey just improve warren buffetts got money problems the drunk hobo down at kwike marts got money problems buffetts just got better money problems than the hobo all of life is like this life is essentially an endless series of problems mark the panda told me he sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella the solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one a moment passed and then i wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from and while were at it who made these margaritas do not hope for a life without problems the panda said there is no such thing instead hope for a life full of good problems and with that he set his glass down adjusted his sombrero and sauntered off into the sunset happiness comes from solving problems problems are a constant in life when you solve your health problem by buying a gym membership you create new problems like having to get up early to get to the gym on time sweating like a methhead for thirty minutes on an elliptical and then getting showered and changed for work so you do not stink up the whole office when you solve your problem of not spending enough time with your partner by designating wednesday night date night you generate new problems such as figuring out what to do every wednesday that you both will not hate making sure you have enough money for nice dinners rediscovering the chemistry and spark you two feel you have lost and unraveling the logistics of fucking in a small bathtub filled with too many bubbles problems never stop they merely get exchanged andor upgraded happiness comes from solving problems the keyword here is solving if you are avoiding your problems or feel like you do not have any problems then you are going to make yourself miserable if you feel like you have problems that you cannot solve you will likewise make yourself miserable the secret sauce is in the solving of the problems not in not having problems in the first place to be happy we need something to solve happiness is therefore a form of action its an activity not something that is passively bestowed upon you not something that you magically discover in a topten article on the huffington post or from any specific guru or teacher it does not magically appear when you finally make enough money to add on that extra room to the house you do not find it waiting for you in a place an idea a jobor even a book for that matter happiness is a constant workinprogress because solving problems is a constant workinprogressthe solutions to todays problems will lay the foundation for tomorrows problems and so on true happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving sometimes those problems are simple eating good food traveling to some new place winning at the new video game you just bought other times those problems are abstract and complicated fixing your relationship with your mother finding a career you can feel good about developing better friendships whatever your problems are the concept is the same solve problems be happy unfortunately for many people life does not feel that simple that is because they fuck things up in at least one of two ways 1   denial some people deny that their problems exist in the first place and because they deny reality they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality this may make them feel good in the short term but it leads to a life of insecurity neuroticism and emotional repression 2   victim mentality some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems even when they in fact could victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances this may make them feel better in the short term but it leads to a life of anger helplessness and despair people deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that its easy and feels good while solving problems is hard and often feels bad forms of blame and denial give us a quick high they are a way to temporarily escape our problems and that escape can provide us a quick rush that makes us feel better highs come in many forms whether its a substance like alcohol the moral righteousness that comes from blaming others or the thrill of some new risky adventure highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about ones life much of the selfhelp world is predicated on peddling highs to people rather than solving legitimate problems many selfhelp gurus teach you new forms of denial and pump you up with exercises that feel good in the short term while ignoring the underlying issue remember nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that hes happy highs also generate addiction the more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems the more you will seek them out in this sense almost anything can become addictive depending on the motivation behind using it we all have our chosen methods to numb the pain of our problems and in moderate doses there is nothing wrong with this but the longer we avoid and the longer we numb the more painful it will be when we finally do confront our issues emotions are overrated emotions evolved for one specific purpose to help us live and reproduce a little bit better that is it they are feedback mechanisms telling us that something is either likely right or likely wrong for usnothing more nothing less much as the pain of touching a hot stove teaches you not to touch it again the sadness of being alone teaches you not to do the things that made you feel so alone again emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change look i do not mean to make light of your midlife crisis or the fact that your drunk dad stole your bike when you were eight years old and you still have not gotten over it but when it comes down to it if you feel crappy its because your brain is telling you that there is a problem that is unaddressed or unresolved in other words negative emotions are a call to action when you feel them its because you are supposed to do something positive emotions on the other hand are rewards for taking the proper action when you feel them life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it then like everything else the positive emotions go away because more problems inevitably emerge emotions are part of the equation of our lives but not the entire equation just because something feels good does not mean it is good just because something feels bad does not mean it is bad emotions are merely signposts suggestions that our neurobiology gives us not commandments therefore we should not always trust our own emotions in fact i believe we should make a habit of questioning them many people are taught to repress their emotions for various personal social or cultural reasonsparticularly negative emotions sadly to deny ones negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems as a result many of these repressed individuals struggle to deal with problems throughout their lives and if they cannot solve problems then they cannot be happy remember pain serves a purpose but then there are those people who overidentify with their emotions everything is justified for no other reason than they felt it oh i broke your windshield but i was really mad i could not help it or i dropped out of school and moved to alaska just because it felt right decisionmaking based on emotional intuition without the aid of reason to keep it in line pretty much always sucks you know who bases their entire lives on their emotions threeyearold kids and dogs you know what else threeyearolds and dogs do shit on the carpet an obsession and overinvestment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow because our biology always needs something more a fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a neverending pursuit of something elsea new house a new relationship another child another pay raise and despite all of our sweat and strain we end up feeling eerily similar to how we started inadequate psychologists sometimes refer to this concept as the hedonic treadmill the idea that were always working hard to change our life situation but we actually never feel very different this is why our problems are recursive and unavoidable the person you marry is the person you fight with the house you buy is the house you repair the dream job you take is the job you stress over everything comes with an inherent sacrificewhatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad what we gain is also what we lose what creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences this is a difficult pill to swallow we like the idea that there is some form of ultimate happiness that can be attained we like the idea that we can alleviate all of our suffering permanently we like the idea that we can feel fulfilled and satisfied with our lives forever but we cannot choose your struggle if i ask you what do you want out of life and you say something like i want to be happy and have a great family and a job i like your response is so common and expected that it does not really mean anything everybody enjoys what feels good everyone wants to live a carefree happy and easy life to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships to look perfect and make money and be popular and wellrespected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the red sea when they walk into the room everybody wants that its easy to want that a more interesting question a question that most people never consider is what pain do you want in your life what are you willing to struggle for because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out for example most people want to get the corner office and make a boatload of moneybut not many people want to suffer through sixtyhour workweeks long commutes obnoxious paperwork and arbitrary corporate hierarchies to escape the confines of an infinite cubicle hell most people want to have great sex and an awesome relationship but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations the awkward silences the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there and so they settle they settle and wonder what if for years and years until the question morphs from what if into what else and when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say what for if not for their lowered standards and expectations twenty years prior then what for because happiness requires struggle it grows from problems joy does not just sprout out of the ground like daisies and rainbows real serious lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles whether you suffer from anxiety or loneliness or obsessivecompulsive disorder or a dickhead boss who ruins half of your waking hours every day the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experiencenot the avoidance of it not the salvation from it people want an amazing physique but you do not end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that come with living inside a gym for hour upon hour unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat planning your life out in tiny platesized portions people want to start their own business but you do not end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk the uncertainty the repeated failures the insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing people want a partner a spouse but you do not end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections building the sexual tension that never gets released and staring blankly at a phone that never rings its part of the game of love you cannot win if you do not play what determines your success is not what do you want to enjoy the relevant question is what pain do you want to sustain the path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame you have to choose something you cannot have a painfree life it cannot all be roses and unicorns all the time pleasure is the easy question and pretty much all of us have a similar answer the more interesting question is the pain what is the pain that you want to sustain that is the hard question that matters the question that will actually get you somewhere its the question that can change a perspective a life its what makes me me and you you its what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together for most of my adolescence and young adulthood i fantasized about being a musiciana rock star in particular any badass guitar song i heard i would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet fingernoodling glory this fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end for me it was never a question of if id ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds but when i had it all planned out i was simply biding my time before i could invest the proper amount of energy and effort into getting out there and making my mark first i needed to finish school then i needed to make some extra money to buy gear then i needed to find enough free time to practice then i had to network and plan my first project then    and then nothing despite my fantasizing about this for over half my lifetime the reality never came to fruition and it took me a long time and a lot of struggle to finally figure out why i did not actually want it i was in love with the resultthe image of me on stage people cheering me rocking out pouring my heart into what i was playingbut i was not in love with the process and because of that i failed at it repeatedly hell i did not even try hard enough to fail at it i hardly tried at all the daily drudgery of practicing the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit the broken strings the blown tube amp hauling forty pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car its a mountain of a dream and a milehigh climb to the top and what it took me a long time to discover is that i did not like to climb much i just liked to imagine the summit the common cultural narratives would tell me that i somehow failed myself that i am a quitter or a loser that i just did not have it that i gave up on my dream and that maybe i let myself succumb to the pressures of society but the truth is far less interesting than any of these explanations the truth is i thought i wanted something but it turns out i did not end of story i wanted the reward and not the struggle i wanted the result and not the process i was in love with not the fight but only the victory and life does not work that way who you are is defined by what you are willing to struggle for people who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can benchpress a small house people who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it people who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it this is not about willpower or grit this is not another admonishment of no pain no gain this is the most simple and basic component of life our struggles determine our successes our problems birth our happiness along with slightly better slightly upgraded problems see its a neverending upward spiral and if you think at any point you are allowed to stop climbing i am afraid you are missing the point because the joy is in the climb itself     chapter 3 you are not special i once knew a guy well call him jimmy jimmy always had various business ventures going on any given day if you asked him what he was doing he would rattle off the name of some firm he was consulting with or he would describe a promising medical app he was looking for angel investors to fund or he would talk about some charity event he was supposed to be the keynote speaker for or how he had an idea for a more efficient type of gas pump that was going to make him billions the guy was always rolling always on and if you gave him an inch of conversational daylight he would pulverize you about how worldspinning his work was how brilliant his latest ideas were and he would namedrop so much it felt like you were talking to a tabloid reporter jimmy was all positivity all the time always pushing himself always working an anglea real gogetter whatever the fuck that means the catch was that jimmy was also a total deadbeatall talk and no walk stoned a majority of the time and spending as much money in bars and fine restaurants as he did on his business ideas jimmy was a professional leech living off his familys hardwon money by spinning them as well as everybody else in the city on false ideas of future tech glory sure sometimes he would put in some token effort or pick up the phone and coldcall some bigwig and namedrop until he ran out of names but nothing ever actually happened none of these ventures ever blossomed into anything yet the guy kept this up for years living off girlfriends and more and more distant relatives well into his late twenties and the most screwedup part was that jimmy felt good about it he had a delusional level of selfconfidence people who laughed at him or hung up on him were in his mind missing the opportunity of their lives people who called him out on his bogus business ideas were too ignorant and inexperienced to understand his genius people who pointed out his deadbeat lifestyle were jealous they were haters who envied his success jimmy did make some money although it was usually through the sketchiest of means like selling another persons business idea as his own or finagling a loan from someone or worse talking someone into giving him equity in their startup he actually occasionally talked people into paying him to do some public speaking about what i cannot even imagine the worst part was that jimmy believed his own bullshit his delusion was so bulletproof it was honestly hard to get mad at him it was actually kind of amazing sometime in the 1960s developing high selfesteemhaving positive thoughts and feelings about oneselfbecame all the rage in psychology research found that people who thought highly about themselves generally performed better and caused fewer problems many researchers and policymakers at the time came to believe that raising a populations selfesteem could lead to some tangible social benefits lower crime better academic records greater employment lower budget deficits as a result beginning in the next decade the 1970s selfesteem practices began to be taught to parents emphasized by therapists politicians and teachers and instituted into educational policy grade inflation for example was implemented to make lowachieving kids feel better about their lack of achievement participation awards and bogus trophies were invented for any number of mundane and expected activities kids were given inane homework assignments like writing down all the reasons why they thought they were special or the five things they liked most about themselves pastors and ministers told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in gods eyes and were destined to excel and not be average business and motivational seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra every single one of us can be exceptional and massively successful but its a generation later and the data is in were not all exceptional it turns out that merely feeling good about yourself does not really mean anything unless you have a good reason to feel good about yourself it turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strongminded and successful adults it turns out that teaching people to believe they are exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what does not lead to a population full of bill gateses and martin luther kings it leads to a population full of jimmys jimmy the delusional startup founder jimmy who smoked pot every day and had no real marketable skills other than talking himself up and believing it jimmy the type of guy who yelled at his business partner for being immature and then maxed out the company credit card at le bernardin trying to impress some russian model jimmy who was quickly running out of aunts and uncles who could loan him more money yes that confident highselfesteem jimmy the jimmy who spent so much time talking about how good he was that he forgot to you know actually do something the problem with the selfesteem movement is that it measured selfesteem by how positively people felt about themselves but a true and accurate measurement of ones selfworth is how people feel about the negative aspects of themselves if a person like jimmy feels absolutely fucking great 999 percent of the time despite his life falling apart around him then how can that be a valid metric for a successful and happy life jimmy is entitled that is he feels as though he deserves good things without actually earning them he believes he should be able to be rich without actually working for it he believes he should be liked and wellconnected without actually helping anyone he believes he should have an amazing lifestyle without actually sacrificing anything people like jimmy become so fixated on feeling good about themselves that they manage to delude themselves into believing that they are accomplishing great things even when they are not they believe they are the brilliant presenter on stage when actually they are making a fool of themselves they believe they are the successful startup founder when in fact they have never had a successful venture they call themselves life coaches and charge money to help others even though they are only twentyfive years old and have not actually accomplished anything substantial in their lives entitled people exude a delusional degree of selfconfidence this confidence can be alluring to others at least for a little while in some instances the entitled persons delusional level of confidence can become contagious and help the people around the entitled person feel more confident in themselves too despite all of jimmys shenanigans i have to admit that it was fun hanging out with him sometimes you felt indestructible around him but the problem with entitlement is that it makes people need to feel good about themselves all the time even at the expense of those around them and because entitled people always need to feel good about themselves they end up spending most of their time thinking about themselves after all it takes a lot of energy and work to convince yourself that your shit does not stink especially when you have actually been living in a toilet once people have developed the thought pattern to constantly construe what happens around them as selfaggrandizing its extremely hard to break them out of it any attempt to reason with them is seen as simply another threat to their superiority by another person who cannot handle how smarttalentedgoodlookingsuccessful they are entitlement closes in upon itself in a kind of narcissistic bubble distorting anything and everything in such a way as to reinforce itself people who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of or a threat to their own greatness if something good happens to them its because of some amazing feat they accomplished if something bad happens to them its because somebody is jealous and trying to bring them down a notch entitlement is impervious people who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority they keep their mental facade standing at all costs even if it sometimes requires being physically or emotionally abusive to those around them but entitlement is a failed strategy its just another high its not happiness the true measurement of selfworth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences but rather how she feels about her negative experiences a person like jimmy hides from his problems by making up imagined successes for himself at every turn and because he cannot face his problems no matter how good he feels about himself he is weak a person who actually has a high selfworth is able to look at the negative parts of his character franklyyes sometimes i am irresponsible with money yes sometimes i exaggerate my own successes yes i rely too much on others to support me and should be more selfreliantand then acts to improve upon them but entitled people because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way they are left chasing high after high and accumulate greater and greater levels of denial but eventually reality must hit and the underlying problems will once again make themselves clear its just a question of when and how painful it will be things fall apart i sat in my 900 am biology class arms cradling my head on my desk as i stared at the clocks second hand making laps each tick syncopated with the teachers droningson about chromosomes and mitosis like most thirteenyearolds stuck in a stuffy fluorescent classroom i was bored a knock came on the door mr price the schools assistant principal stuck his head in excuse me for interrupting mark can you step outside with me for a moment oh and bring your things with you strange i thought kids get sent to the principal but the principal rarely gets sent to them i gathered my things and stepped out the hallway was empty hundreds of beige lockers converged on the horizon mark can you take me to your locker please sure i say and slug myself down the hall baggy jeans and moppy hair and oversized pantera tshirt and all we get to my locker open it please mr price says so i do he steps in front of me and gathers my coat my gym bag my backpackall of the lockers contents minus a few notebooks and pencils he starts walking away come with me please he says without looking back i start to get an uneasy feeling i follow him to his office where he asks me to sit down he closes the door and locks it he goes over to the window and adjusts the blinds to block the view from outside my palms begin to sweat this is not a normal principal visit mr price sits down and quietly rummages through my things checking pockets unzipping zippers shaking out my gym clothes and placing them on the floor without looking up at me mr price asks do you know what i am looking for mark no i say drugs the word shocks me into nervous attention dddrugs i stammer what kind he looks at me sternly i do not know what kind do you have he opens one of my binders and checks the small pockets meant for pens my sweat blossoms like a fungal growth it spreads from my palms to my arms and now my neck my temples pulsate as blood floods my brain and face like most thirteenyearolds freshly accused of possessing narcotics and bringing them to school i want to run away and hide i do not know what you are talking about i protest the words sounding far meeker than id like i feel as if i should be sounding confident in myself right now or maybe not maybe i should be scared do liars sound more scared or confident because however they sound i want to sound the opposite instead my lack of confidence compounds unconfidence about my sounding unconfident making me more unconfident that fucking feedback loop from hell well see about that he says turning his attention to my backpack which seemingly has one hundred pockets each is loaded with its own silly teen desideratacolored pens old notes passed in class earlynineties cds with cracked cases driedup markers an old sketchpad with half its pages missing dust and lint and crap accumulated during a maddeningly circuitous middle school existence my sweat must be pumping at the speed of light because time extends itself and dilates such that what is mere seconds on that 900 am secondperiod biology clock now feels like paleolithic eons and i am growing up and dying every minute just me and mr price and my bottomless backpack somewhere around the mesolithic age mr price finishes searching the backpack having found nothing he seems flustered he turns the pack upside down and let us all of my crap crash onto his office floor hes now sweating as profusely as i am except in place of my terror there is his anger no drugs today eh he tries to sound casual nope so do i he spreads my stuff out separating each item and coagulating them into little piles beside my gym gear my coat and backpack now lie empty and lifeless on his lap he sighs and stares at the wall like most thirteenyearolds locked in an office with a man angrily throwing their shit all over the floor i want to cry mr price scans the contents organized on the floor nothing illicit or illegal no narcotics not even anything against school policy he sighs and then throws the coat and backpack on the floor too he bends over and puts his elbows on his knees making his face level with mine mark i am going to give you one last chance to be honest with me if you are honest this will turn out much better for you if it turns out you are lying then its going to be much worse as if on cue i gulp now tell me the truth mr price demands did you bring drugs to school today fighting back tears screams clawing at my throat i stare my tormentor in the face and in a pleading voice dying to be relieved of its adolescent horrors i say no i do not have any drugs i have no idea what you are talking about okay he says signaling surrender i guess you can collect your things and go he takes one last longing gaze at my deflated backpack lying like a broken promise there on his office floor he casually puts one foot down on the pack stomping lightly a lastditch effort i anxiously wait for him to get up and leave so i can get on with my life and forget this whole nightmare but his foot stops on something what is this he asks tapping with his foot what is what i say there is still something in here he picks up the bag and starts feeling around the bottom of it for me the room gets fuzzy everything goes wobbly when i was young i was smart i was friendly but i was also a shithead i mean that in the most loving way possible i was a rebellious lying little shithead angry and full of resentment when i was twelve i hacked my houses security system with refrigerator magnets so i could sneak out undetected in the middle of the night my friend and i would put his moms car in neutral and push it into the street so we could drive around without waking her up i would write papers about abortion because i knew my english teacher was a hardcore conservative christian another friend and i stole cigarettes from his mom and sold them to kids out behind the school and i also cut a secret compartment into the bottom of my backpack to hide my marijuana that was the same hidden compartment mr price found after stepping on the drugs i was hiding i had been lying and as promised mr price did not go easy on me a few hours later like most thirteenyearolds handcuffed in the back of a police car i thought my life was over and i was kind of right in a way my parents quarantined me at home i was to have no friends for the foreseeable future having been expelled from school i was to be homeschooled for the rest of the year my mom made me get a haircut and threw out all of my marilyn manson and metallica shirts which for an adolescent in 1998 was tantamount to being sentenced to death by lameness my dad dragged me to his office with him in the mornings and made me file papers for hours on end once homeschooling was over i was enrolled in a small private christian school whereand this may not surprise youi did not exactly fit in and just when i had finally cleaned up my act and turned in my assignments and learned the value of good clerical responsibility my parents decided to get divorced i tell you all of this only to point out that my adolescence sucked donkey balls i lost all of my friends my community my legal rights and my family within the span of about nine months my therapist in my twenties would later call this some real traumatic shit and i would spend the next decadeandchange working on unraveling it and becoming less of a selfabsorbed entitled little prick the problem with my home life back then was not all of the horrible things that were said or done rather it was all of the horrible things that needed to be said and done but were not my family stonewalls the way warren buffett makes money or jenna jameson fucks were champions at it the house could have been burning down around us and it would have been met with oh no everythings fine a tad warm in here perhapsbut really everythings fine when my parents got divorced there were no broken dishes no slammed doors no screaming arguments about who fucked whom once they had reassured my brother and me that it was not our fault we had a qa sessionyes you read that rightabout the logistics of the new living arrangements not a tear was she would not a voice was raised the closest peek my brother and i got into our parents unraveling emotional lives was hearing nobody cheated on anybody oh that is nice it was a tad warm in the room but really everything was fine my parents are good people i do not blame them for any of this not anymore at least and i love them very much they have their own stories and their own journeys and their own problems just as all parents do and just as all of their parents do and so on and like all parents my parents with the best of intentions imparted some of their problems to me as i probably will to my kids when real traumatic shit like this happens in our lives we begin to unconsciously feel as though we have problems that were incapable of ever solving and this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless but it also causes something else to happen if we have problems that are unsolvable our unconscious figures that were either uniquely special or uniquely defective in some way that were somehow unlike everyone else and that the rules must be different for us put simply we become entitled the pain from my adolescence led me down a road of entitlement that lasted through much of my early adulthood whereas jimmys entitlement played out in the business world where he pretended to be a huge success my entitlement played out in my relationships particularly with women my trauma had revolved around intimacy and acceptance so i felt a constant need to overcompensate to prove to myself that i was loved and accepted at all times and as a result i soon took to chasing women the same way a cocaine addict takes to a snowman made out of cocaine i made sweet love to it and then promptly suffocated myself in it i became a playeran immature selfish albeit sometimes charming player and i strung up a long series of superficial and unhealthy relationships for the better part of a decade it was not so much the sex i craved although the sex was fun it was the validation i was wanted i was loved for the first time since i could remember i was worthy my craving for validation quickly fed into a mental habit of selfaggrandizing and overindulgence i felt entitled to say or do whatever i wanted to break peoples trust to ignore peoples feelings and then justify it later with shitty halfassed apologies while this period certainly had its moments of fun and excitement and i met some wonderful women my life was more or less a wreck the whole time i was often unemployed living on friends couches or with my mom drinking way more than i should have been alienating a number of friendsand when i did meet a woman i really liked my selfabsorption quickly torpedoed everything the deeper the pain the more helpless we feel against our problems and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems this entitlement plays out in one of two ways 1   i am awesome and the rest of you all suck so i deserve special treatment 2   i suck and the rest of you are all awesome so i deserve special treatment opposite mindset on the outside but the same selfish creamy core in the middle in fact you will often see entitled people flip back and forth between the two either they are on top of the world or the world is on top of them depending on the day of the week or how well they are doing with their particular addiction at that moment most people correctly identify a person like jimmy as a raging narcissistic asshat that is because hes pretty blatant in his delusionally high selfregard what most people do not correctly identify as entitlement are those people who perpetually feel as though they are inferior and unworthy of the world because construing everything in life so as to make yourself out to be constantly victimized requires just as much selfishness as the opposite it takes just as much energy and delusional selfaggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all the truth is that there is no such thing as a personal problem if you have got a problem chances are millions of other people have had it in the past have it now and are going to have it in the future likely people you know too that does not minimize the problem or mean that it should not hurt it does not mean you are not legitimately a victim in some circumstances it just means that you are not special often its this realizationthat you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or painthat is the first and most important step toward solving them but for some reason it appears that more and more people particularly young people are forgetting this numerous professors and educators have noted a lack of emotional resilience and an excess of selfish demands in todays young people its not uncommon now for books to be removed from a classs curriculum for no other reason than that they made someone feel bad speakers and professors are shouted down and banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some halloween costumes really are not that offensive school counselors note that more students than ever are exhibiting severe signs of emotional distress over what are otherwise runofthemill daily college experiences such as an argument with a roommate or getting a low grade in a class its strange that in an age when we are more connected than ever entitlement seems to be at an alltime high something about recent technology seems to allow our insecurities to run amok like never before the more freedom were given to express ourselves the more we want to be free of having to deal with anyone who may disagree with us or upset us the more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist the easier and more problemfree our lives become the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better the benefits of the internet and social media are unquestionably fantastic in many ways this is the best time in history to be alive but perhaps these technologies are having some unintended social side effects perhaps these same technologies that have liberated and educated so many are simultaneously enabling peoples sense of entitlement more than ever before the tyranny of exceptionalism most of us are pretty average at most things we do even if you are exceptional at one thing chances are you are average or below average at most other things that is just the nature of life to become truly great at something you have to dedicate shittons of time and energy to it and because we all have limited time and energy few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing if anything at all we can then say that its a statistical improbability that any single person will be an extraordinary performer in all areas of life or even in many areas of their life brilliant businesspeople are often fuckups in their personal lives extraordinary athletes are often shallow and as dumb as a lobotomized rock many celebrities are probably just as clueless about life as the people who gawk at them and follow their every move were all for the most part pretty average people but its the extremes that get all of the publicity we kind of know this already but we rarely think andor talk about it and we certainly never discuss why this could be a problem having the internet google facebook youtube and access to five hundredplus channels of television is amazing but our attention is limited there is no way we can process the tidal waves of information flowing past us constantly therefore the only zeroes and ones that break through and catch our attention are the truly exceptional pieces of informationthose in the 99999th percentile all day every day we are flooded with the truly extraordinary the best of the best the worst of the worst the greatest physical feats the funniest jokes the most upsetting news the scariest threats nonstop our lives today are filled with information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience because in the media business that is what gets eyeballs and eyeballs bring dollars that is the bottom line yet the vast majority of life resides in the humdrum middle the vast majority of life is unextraordinary indeed quite average this flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal and because were all quite average most of the time the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate because clearly we are somehow not good enough so more and more we feel the need to compensate through entitlement and addiction we cope the only way we know how either through selfaggrandizing or through otheraggrandizing some of us do this by cooking up getrichquick schemes others do it by taking off across the world to save starving babies in africa others do it by excelling in school and winning every award others do it by shooting up a school others do it by trying to have sex with anything that talks and breathes this ties in to the growing culture of entitlement that i talked about earlier millennials often get blamed for this cultural shift but that is likely because millennials are the most pluggedin and visible generation in fact the tendency toward entitlement is apparent across all of society and i believe its linked to massmediadriven exceptionalism the problem is that the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing is screwing up a lot of peoples expectations for themselves the inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves makes them feel that they need to be more extreme more radical and more selfassured to get noticed or even matter when i was a young man my insecurities around intimacy were exacerbated by all the ridiculous narratives of masculinity circulating throughout pop culture and those same narratives are still circulating to be a cool guy you have to party like a rock star to be respected you have to be admired by women sex is the most valuable thing a man can attain and its worth sacrificing anything including your own dignity to get it this constant stream of unrealistic media dogpiles onto our existing feelings of insecurity by overexposing us to the unrealistic standards we fail to live up to not only do we feel subjected to unsolvable problems but we feel like losers because a simple google search shows us thousands of people without those same problems technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems the internet has not just opensourced information it has also opensourced insecurity selfdoubt and shame bbbbut if i am not going to be special or extraordinary what is the point it has become an accepted part of our culture today to believe that we are all destined to do something truly extraordinary celebrities say it business tycoons say it politicians say it even oprah says it so it must be true each and every one of us can be extraordinary we all deserve greatness the fact that this statement is inherently contradictoryafter all if everyone were extraordinary then by definition no one would be extraordinaryis missed by most people and instead of questioning what we actually deserve or do not deserve we eat the message up and ask for more being average has become the new standard of failure the worst thing you can be is in the middle of the pack the middle of the bell curve when a cultures standard of success is to be extraordinary it then becomes better to be at the extreme low end of the bell curve than to be in the middle because at least there you are still special and deserve attention many people choose this strategy to prove to everyone that they are the most miserable or the most oppressed or the most victimized a lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it they will never achieve anything never improve and that their life will not matter this sort of thinking is dangerous once you accept the premise that a life is worthwhile only if it is truly notable and great then you basically accept the fact that most of the human population including yourself sucks and is worthless and this mindset can quickly turn dangerous to both yourself and others the rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they are exceptional on the contrary they become amazing because they are obsessed with improvement and that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are in fact not that great at all its antientitlement people who become great at something become great because they understand that they are not already greatthey are mediocre they are averageand that they could be so much better all of this every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness stuff is basically just jerking off your ego its a message that tastes good going down but in reality is nothing more than empty calories that make you emotionally fat and bloated the proverbial big mac for your heart and your brain the ticket to emotional health like that to physical health comes from eating your veggiesthat is accepting the bland and mundane truths of life truths such as your actions actually do not matter that much in the grand scheme of things and the vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy and that is okay this vegetable course will taste bad at first very bad you will avoid accepting it but once ingested your body will wake up feeling more potent and more alive after all that constant pressure to be something amazing to be the next big thing will be lifted off your back the stress and anxiety of always feeling inadequate and constantly needing to prove yourself will dissipate and the knowledge and acceptance of your own mundane existence will actually free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish without judgment or lofty expectations you will have a growing appreciation for lifes basic experiences the pleasures of simple friendship creating something helping a person in need reading a good book laughing with someone you care about sounds boring does not it that is because these things are ordinary but maybe they are ordinary for a reason because they are what actually matters     chapter 4 the value of suffering in the closing months of 1944 after almost a decade of war the tide was turning against japan their economy was floundering their military overstretched across half of asia and the territories they had won throughout the pacific were now toppling like dominoes to us forces defeat seemed inevitable on december 26 1944 second lieutenant hiroo onoda of the japanese imperial army was deployed to the small island of lubang in the philippines his orders were to slow the united states progress as much as possible to stand and fight at all costs and to never surrender both he and his commander knew it was essentially a suicide mission in february 1945 the americans arrived on lubang and took the island with overwhelming force within days most of the japanese soldiers had either surrendered or been killed but onoda and three of his men managed to hide in the jungle from there they began a guerrilla warfare campaign against the us forces and the local population attacking supply lines shooting at stray soldiers and interfering with the american forces in any way that they could that august half a year later the united states dropped atomic bombs on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki japan surrendered and the deadliest war in human history came to its dramatic conclusion however thousands of japanese soldiers were still scattered among the pacific isles and most like onoda were hiding in the jungle unaware that the war was over these holdouts continued to fight and pillage as they had before this was a real problem for rebuilding eastern asia after the war and the governments agreed something must be done the us military in conjunction with the japanese government dropped thousands of leaflets throughout the pacific region announcing that the war was over and it was time for everyone to go home onoda and his men like many others found and read these leaflets but unlike most of the others onoda decided that they were fake a trap set by the american forces to get the guerrilla fighters to show themselves onoda burned the leaflets and he and his men stayed hidden and continued to fight five years went by the leaflets had stopped and most of the american forces had long since gone home the local population on lubang attempted to return to their normal lives of farming and fishing yet there were hiroo onoda and his merry men still shooting at the farmers burning their crops stealing their livestock and murdering locals who wandered too far into the jungle the philippine government then took to drawing up new flyers and spreading them out across the jungle come out they said the war is over you lost but these too were ignored in 1952 the japanese government made one final effort to draw the last remaining soldiers out of hiding throughout the pacific this time letters and pictures from the missing soldiers families were airdropped along with a personal note from the emperor himself once again onoda refused to believe that the information was real once again he believed the airdrop to be a trick by the americans once again he and his men stood and continued to fight another few years went by and the philippine locals sick of being terrorized finally armed themselves and began firing back by 1959 one of onodas companions had surrendered and another had been killed then a decade later onodas last companion a man called kozuka was killed in a shootout with the local police while he was burning rice fieldsstill waging war against the local population a full quartercentury after the end of world war ii onoda having now spent more than half of his life in the jungles of lubang was all alone in 1972 the news of kozukas death reached japan and caused a stir the japanese people thought the last of the soldiers from the war had come home years earlier the japanese media began to wonder if kozuka had still been on lubang until 1972 then perhaps onoda himself the last known japanese holdout from world war ii might still be alive as well that year both the japanese and philippine governments sent search parties to look for the enigmatic second lieutenant now part myth part hero and part ghost they found nothing as the months progressed the story of lieutenant onoda morphed into something of an urban legend in japanthe war hero who sounded too insane to actually exist many romanticized him others criticized him others thought he was the stuff of fairy tale invented by those who still wanted to believe in a japan that had disappeared long ago it was around this time that a young man named norio suzuki first heard of onoda suzuki was an adventurer an explorer and a bit of a hippie born after the war ended he had dropped out of school and spent four years hitchhiking his way across asia the middle east and africa sleeping on park benches in strangers cars in jail cells and under the stars he volunteered on farms for food and donated blood to pay for places to stay he was a free spirit and perhaps a little bit nuts in 1972 suzuki needed another adventure he had returned to japan after his travels and found the strict cultural norms and social hierarchy to be stifling he hated school he could not hold down a job he wanted to be back on the road back on his own again for suzuki the legend of hiroo onoda came as the answer to his problems it was a new and worthy adventure for him to pursue suzuki believed that he would be the one who would find onoda sure search parties conducted by the japanese philippine and american governments had not been able to find onoda local police forces had been scavenging the jungle for almost thirty years with no luck thousands of leaflets had met with no responsebut fuck it this deadbeat collegedropout hippie was going to be the one to find him unarmed and untrained for any sort of reconnaissance or tactical warfare suzuki traveled to lubang and began wandering around the jungle all by himself his strategy scream onodas name really loudly and tell him that the emperor was worried about him he found onoda in four days suzuki stayed with onoda in the jungle for some time onoda had been alone by that point for over a year and once found by suzuki he welcomed the companionship and was desperate to learn what had been happening in the outside world from a japanese source he could trust the two men became sortakinda friends suzuki asked onoda why he had stayed and continued to fight onoda said it was simple he had been given the order to never surrender so he stayed for nearly thirty years he had simply been following an order onoda then asked suzuki why a hippie boy like himself came looking for him suzuki said that he would left japan in search of three things lieutenant onoda a panda bear and the abominable snowman in that order the two men had been brought together under the most curious of circumstances two wellintentioned adventurers chasing false visions of glory like a reallife japanese don quixote and sancho panza stuck together in the damp recesses of a philippine jungle both imagining themselves heroes despite both being alone with nothing doing nothing onoda had already by then given up most of his life to a phantom war suzuki would give his up too having already found hiroo onoda and the panda bear he would die a few years later in the himalayas still in search of the abominable snowman humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes on the surface these causes make no sense its hard to imagine how onoda could have been happy on that island for those thirty yearsliving off insects and rodents sleeping in the dirt murdering civilians decade after decade or why suzuki trekked off to his own death with no money no companions and no purpose other than to chase an imaginary yeti yet later in his life onoda said he regretted nothing he claimed that he was proud of his choices and his time on lubang he said that it had been an honor to devote a sizable portion of his life in service to a nonexistent empire suzuki had he survived likely would have said something similar that he was doing exactly what he was meant to do that he regretted nothing these men both chose how they wished to suffer hiroo onoda chose to suffer for loyalty to a dead empire suzuki chose to suffer for adventure no matter how illadvised to both men their suffering meant something it fulfilled some greater because and because it meant something they were able to endure it or perhaps even enjoy it if suffering is inevitable if our problems in life are unavoidable then the question we should be asking is not how do i stop suffering but why am i sufferingfor what purpose hiroo onoda returned to japan in 1974 and became a kind of celebrity in his home country he was shuttled around from talk show to radio station politicians clamored to shake his hand he published a book and was even offered a large sum of money by the government but what he found when he returned to japan horrified him a consumerist capitalist superficial culture that had lost all of the traditions of honor and sacrifice upon which his generation had been raised onoda tried to use his sudden celebrity to espouse the values of old japan but he was tonedeaf to this new society he was seen more as a showpiece than as a serious cultural thinkera japanese man who had emerged from a time capsule for all to marvel at like a relic in a museum and in the irony of ironies onoda became far more depressed than he would ever been in the jungle for all those years at least in the jungle his life had stood for something it had meant something that had made his suffering endurable indeed even a little bit desirable but back in japan in what he considered to be a vacuous nation full of hippies and loose women in western clothing he was confronted with the unavoidable truth that his fighting had meant nothing the japan he had lived and fought for no longer existed and the weight of this realization pierced him in a way that no bullet ever had because his suffering had meant nothing it suddenly became realized and true thirty years wasted and so in 1980 onoda packed up and moved to brazil where he remained until he died the selfawareness onion selfawareness is like an onion there are multiple layers to it and the more you peel them back the more likely you are going to start crying at inappropriate times let us say the first layer of the selfawareness onion is a simple understanding of ones emotions this is when i feel happy this makes me feel sad this gives me hope unfortunately there are many people who suck at even this most basic level of selfawareness i know because i am one of them my wife and i sometimes have a fun backandforth that goes something like this her what is wrong me nothings wrong nothing at all her no something is wrong tell me me i am fine really her are you sure you look upset me with nervous laughter really no i am okay seriously thirty minutes later     me    and that is why i am so fucking pissed off he just acts as if i do not exist half the time we all have emotional blind spots often they have to do with the emotions that we were taught were inappropriate growing up it takes years of practice and effort to get good at identifying blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately but this task is hugely important and worth the effort the second layer of the selfawareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions these why questions are difficult and often take months or even years to answer consistently and accurately most people need to go to some sort of therapist just to hear these questions asked for the first time such questions are important because they illuminate what we consider success or failure why do you feel angry is it because you failed to achieve some goal why do you feel lethargic and uninspired is it because you do not think you are good enough this layer of questioning helps us understand the root because of the emotions that overwhelm us once we understand that root because we can ideally do something to change it but there is another even deeper level of the selfawareness onion and that one is full of fucking tears the third level is our personal values why do i consider this to be successfailure how am i choosing to measure myself by what standard am i judging myself and everyone around me this level which takes constant questioning and effort is incredibly difficult to reach but its the most important because our values determine the nature of our problems and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives values underlie everything we are and do if what we value is unhelpful if what we consider successfailure is poorly chosen then everything based upon those valuesthe thoughts the emotions the daytoday feelingswill all be out of whack everything we think and feel about a situation ultimately comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be most people are horrible at answering these why questions accurately and this prevents them from achieving a deeper knowledge of their own values sure they may say they value honesty and a true friend but then they turn around and lie about you behind your back to make themselves feel better people may perceive that they feel lonely but when they ask themselves why they feel lonely they tend to come up with a way to blame otherseveryone else is mean or no one is cool or smart enough to understand themand thus they further avoid their problem instead of seeking to solve it for many people this passes as selfawareness and yet if they were able to go deeper and look at their underlying values they would see that their original analysis was based on avoiding responsibility for their own problem rather than accurately identifying the problem they would see that their decisions were based on chasing highs not generating true happiness most selfhelp gurus ignore this deeper level of selfawareness as well they take people who are miserable because they want to be rich and then give them all sorts of advice on how to make more money all the while ignoring important valuesbased questions why do they feel such a need to be rich in the first place how are they choosing to measure successfailure for themselves is it not perhaps some particular value that is the root because of their unhappiness and not the fact that they do not drive a bentley yet much of the advice out there operates at a shallow level of simply trying to make people feel good in the short term while the real longterm problems never get solved peoples perceptions and feelings may change but the underlying values and the metrics by which those values are assessed stay the same this is not real progress this is just another way to achieve more highs honest selfquestioning is difficult it requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer in fact in my experience the more uncomfortable the answer the more likely it is to be true take a moment and think of something that is really bugging you now ask yourself why it bugs you chances are the answer will involve a failure of some sort then take that failure and ask why it seems true to you what if that failure was not really a failure what if you have been looking at it the wrong way a recent example from my own life it bugs me that my brother does not return my texts or emails why because it feels like he does not give a shit about me why does this seem true because if he wanted to have a relationship with me he would take ten seconds out of his day to interact with me why does his lack of relationship with you feel like a failure because were brothers were supposed to have a good relationship two things are operating here a value that i hold dear and a metric that i use to assess progress toward that value my value brothers are supposed to have a good relationship with one another my metric being in contact by phone or emailthis is how i measure my success as a brother by holding on to this metric i make myself feel like a failure which occasionally ruins my saturday mornings we could dig even deeper by repeating the process why are brothers supposed to have a good relationship because they are family and family are supposed to be close why does that seem true because your family is supposed to matter to you more than anyone else why does that seem true because being close with your family is normal and healthy and i do not have that in this exchange i am clear about my underlying valuehaving a good relationship with my brotherbut i am still struggling with my metric i have given it another name closeness but the metric has not really changed i am still judging myself as a brother based on frequency of contactand comparing myself using that metric against other people i know everyone else or so it seems has a close relationship with their family members and i do not so obviously there must be something wrong with me but what if i am choosing a poor metric for myself and my life what else could be true that i am not considering well perhaps i do not need to be close to my brother to have that good relationship that i value perhaps there just needs to be some mutual respect which there is or maybe mutual trust is what to look for and its there perhaps these metrics would be better assessments of brotherhood than how many text messages he and i exchange this clearly makes sense it feels true for me but it still fucking hurts that my brother and i are not close and there is no positive way to spin it there is no secret way to glorify myself through this knowledge sometimes brotherseven brothers who love each otherdont have close relationships and that is fine it is hard to accept at first but that is fine what is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation how you choose to measure it and value it problems may be inevitable but the meaning of each problem is not we get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them the standard by which we choose to measure them rock star problems in 1983 a talented young guitarist was kicked out of his band in the worst possible way the band had just been signed to a record deal and they were about to record their first album but a couple days before recording began the band showed the guitarist the doorno warning no discussion no dramatic blowout they literally woke him up one day by handing him a bus ticket home as he sat on the bus back to los angeles from new york the guitarist kept asking himself how did this happen what did i do wrong what will i do now record contracts did not exactly fall out of the sky especially for raucous upstart metal bands had he missed his one and only shot but by the time the bus hit la the guitarist had gotten over his selfpity and had vowed to start a new band he decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision he would become so famous that they would be subjected to decades of seeing him on tv hearing him on the radio seeing posters of him in the streets and pictures of him in magazines they would be flipping burgers somewhere loading vans from their shitty club gigs fat and drunk with their ugly wives and he would be rocking out in front of stadium crowds live on television he would bathe in the tears of his betrayers each tear wiped dry by a crisp clean hundreddollar bill and so the guitarist worked as if possessed by a musical demon he spent months recruiting the best musicians he could findfar better musicians than his previous bandmates he wrote dozens of songs and practiced religiously his seething anger fueled his ambition revenge became his muse within a couple years his new band had signed a record deal of their own and a year after that their first record would go gold the guitarists name was dave mustaine and the new band he formed was the legendary heavymetal band megadeth megadeth would go on to sell over 25 million albums and tour the world many times over today mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavymetal music unfortunately the band he was kicked out of was metallica which has sold over 180 million albums worldwide metallica is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock bands of all time and because of this in a rare intimate interview in 2003 a tearful mustaine admitted that he could not help but still consider himself a failure despite all that he had accomplished in his mind he would always be the guy who got kicked out of metallica were apes we think were all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear but were just a bunch of finely ornamented apes and because we are apes we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status the question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others rather the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves dave mustaine whether he realized it or not chose to measure himself by whether he was more successful and popular than metallica the experience of getting thrown out of his former band was so painful for him that he adopted success relative to metallica as the metric by which to measure himself and his music career despite taking a horrible event in his life and making something positive out of it as mustaine did with megadeth his choice to hold on to metallicas success as his lifedefining metric continued to hurt him decades later despite all the money and the fans and the accolades he still considered himself a failure now you and i may look at dave mustaines situation and laugh here is this guy with millions of dollars hundreds of thousands of adoring fans a career doing the thing he loves best and still hes getting all weepyeyed that his rock star buddies from twenty years ago are way more famous than he is this is because you and i have different values than mustaine does and we measure ourselves by different metrics our metrics are probably more like i do not want to work a job for a boss i hate or id like to earn enough money to send my kid to a good school or id be happy to not wake up in a drainage ditch and by these metrics mustaine is wildly unimaginably successful but by his metric be more popular and successful than metallica hes a failure our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else onodas value of loyalty to the japanese empire is what sustained him on lubang for almost thirty years but this same value is also what made him miserable upon his return to japan mustaines metric of being better than metallica likely helped him launch an incredibly successful music career but that same metric later tortured him in spite of his success if you want to change how you see your problems you have to change what you value andor how you measure failuresuccess as an example let us look at another musician who got kicked out of another band his story eerily echoes that of dave mustaine although it happened two decades earlier it was 1962 and there was a buzz around an upandcoming band from liverpool england this band had funny haircuts and an even funnier name but their music was undeniably good and the record industry was finally taking notice there was john the lead singer and songwriter paul the boyishfaced romantic bass player george the rebellious lead guitar player and then there was the drummer he was considered the bestlooking of the bunchthe girls all went wild for him and it was his face that began to appear in the magazines first he was the most professional member of the group too he did not do drugs he had a steady girlfriend there were even a few people in suits and ties who thought he should be the face of the band not john or paul his name was pete best and in 1962 after landing their first record contract the other three members of the beatles quietly got together and asked their manager brian epstein to fire him epstein agonized over the decision he liked pete so he put it off hoping the other three guys would change their minds months later a mere three days before the recording of the first record began epstein finally called best to his office there the manager unceremoniously told him to piss off and find another band he gave no reason no explanation no condolencesjust told him that the other guys wanted him out of the group so uh best of luck as a replacement the band brought in some oddball named ringo starr ringo was older and had a big funny nose ringo agreed to get the same ugly haircut as john paul and george and insisted on writing songs about octopuses and submarines the other guys said sure fuck it why not within six months of bests firing beatlemania had erupted making john paul george and pete ringo arguably four of the most famous faces on the entire planet meanwhile best understandably fell into a deep depression and spent a lot of time doing what any englishman will do if you give him a reason to drink the rest of the sixties were not kind to pete best by 1965 he had sued two of the beatles for slander and all of his other musical projects had failed horribly in 1968 he attempted suicide only to be talked out of it by his mother his life was a wreck best did not have the same redemptive story dave mustaine did he never became a global superstar or made millions of dollars yet in many ways best ended up better off than mustaine in an interview in 1994 best said i am happier than i would have been with the beatles what the hell best explained that the circumstances of his getting kicked out of the beatles ultimately led him to meet his wife and then his marriage led him to having children his values changed he began to measure his life differently fame and glory would have been nice surebut he decided that what he already had was more important a big and loving family a stable marriage a simple life he even still got to play drums touring europe and recording albums well into the 2000s so what was really lost just a lot of attention and adulation whereas what was gained meant so much more to him these stories suggest that some values and metrics are better than others some lead to good problems that are easily and regularly solved others lead to bad problems that are not easily and regularly solved shitty values there are a handful of common values that create really poor problems for peopleproblems that can hardly be solved so let us go over some of them quickly 1   pleasure pleasure is great but its a horrible value to prioritize your life around ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out ask an adulterer who shattered her family and lost her children whether pleasure ultimately made her happy ask a man who almost ate himself to death how pleasure helped him solve his problems  pleasure is a false god research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious more emotionally unstable and more depressed pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose  and yet pleasure is what is marketed to us twentyfourseven its what we fixate on its what we use to numb and distract ourselves but pleasure while necessary in life in certain doses is not by itself sufficient  pleasure is not the because of happiness rather it is the effect if you get the other stuff right the other values and metrics then pleasure will naturally occur as a byproduct 2   material success many people measure their selfworth based on how much money they make or what kind of car they drive or whether their front lawn is greener and prettier than the nextdoor neighbors  research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs food shelter and so on the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero so if you are starving and living on the street in the middle of india an extra ten thousand dollars a year would affect your happiness a lot but if you are sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country an extra ten thousand dollars per year will not affect anything muchmeaning that you are killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing  the other issue with overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values such as honesty nonviolence and compassion when people measure themselves not by their behavior but by the status symbols they are able to collect then not only are they shallow but they are probably assholes as well 3   always being rightour brains are inefficient machines we consistently make poor assumptions misjudge probabilities misremember facts give in to cognitive biases and make decisions based on our emotional whims as humans were wrong pretty much constantly so if your metric for life success is to be rightwell you are going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself the fact is people who base their selfworth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes they lack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others they close themselves off to new and important information its far more helpful to assume that you are ignorant and do not know a whole lot this keeps you unattached to superstitious or poorly informed beliefs and promotes a constant state of learning and growth 4   staying positive then there are those who measure their lives by the ability to be positive about well pretty much everything lost your job great that is an opportunity to explore your passions husband cheated on you with your sister well at least you are learning what you really mean to the people around you child dying of throat cancer at least you do not have to pay for college anymore while there is something to be said for staying on the sunny side of life the truth is sometimes life sucks and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction constant positivity is a form of avoidance not a valid solution to lifes problemsproblems which by the way if you are choosing the right values and metrics should be invigorating you and motivating you its simple really things go wrong people upset us accidents happen these things make us feel like shit and that is fine negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health to deny that negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solve them the trick with negative emotions is to 1 express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2 express them in a way that aligns with your values simple example a value of mine is nonviolence therefore when i get mad at somebody i express that anger but i also make a point of not punching them in the face radical idea i know but the anger is not the problem anger is natural anger is a part of life anger is arguably quite healthy in many situations remember emotions are just feedback see its the punching people in the face that is the problem not the anger the anger is merely the messenger for my fist in your face do not blame the messenger blame my fist or your face when we force ourselves to stay positive at all times we deny the existence of our lifes problems and when we deny our problems we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life thus to duck our problems is to lead a meaningless even if supposedly pleasant existence in the long run completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer these activities are stressful arduous and often unpleasant they also require withstanding problem after problem yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joyous things well ever do they involve pain struggle even anger and despairyet once they are accomplished we look back and get all mistyeyed telling our grandkids about them as freud once said one day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful this is why these valuespleasure material success always being right staying positiveare poor ideals for a persons life some of the greatest moments of ones life are not pleasant not successful not known and not positive the point is to nail down some good values and metrics and pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result these things are side effects of good values by themselves they are empty highs defining good and bad values good values are 1 realitybased 2 socially constructive and 3 immediate and controllable bad values are 1 superstitious 2 socially destructive and 3 not immediate or controllable honesty is a good value because its something you have complete control over it reflects reality and it benefits others even if its sometimes unpleasant popularity on the other hand is a bad value if that is your value and if your metric is being the most popular guygirl at the dance party much of what happens will be out of your control you do not know who else will be at the event and you probably will not know who half those people are second the valuemetric is not based on reality you may feel popular or unpopular when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you side note as a rule people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them some examples of good healthy values honesty innovation vulnerability standing up for oneself standing up for others selfrespect curiosity charity humility creativity some examples of bad unhealthy values dominance through manipulation or violence indiscriminate fucking feeling good all the time always being the center of attention not being alone being liked by everybody being rich for the sake of being rich sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods you will notice that good healthy values are achieved internally something like creativity or humility can be experienced right now you simply have to orient your mind in a certain way to experience it these values are immediate and controllable and engage you with the world as it is rather than how you wish it were bad values are generally reliant on external eventsflying in a private jet being told you are right all the time owning a house in the bahamas eating a cannoli while getting blown by three strippers bad values while sometimes fun or pleasurable lie outside of your control and often require socially destructive or superstitious means to achieve values are about prioritization everybody would love a good cannoli or a house in the bahamas the question is your priorities what are the values that you prioritize above everything else and that therefore influence your decisionmaking more than anything else hiroo onodas highest value was complete loyalty and service to the japanese empire this value in case you could not tell from reading about him stank worse than a rotten sushi roll it created really shitty problems for hiroonamely he got stuck on a remote island where he lived off bugs and worms for thirty years oh and he felt compelled to murder innocent civilians too so despite the fact that hiroo saw himself as a success and despite the fact he lived up to his metrics i think we can all agree that his life really suckednone of us would trade shoes with him given the opportunity nor would we commend his actions dave mustaine achieved great fame and glory and felt like a failure anyway this is because he would adopted a crappy value based on some arbitrary comparison to the success of others this value gave him awful problems such as i need to sell 150 million more records then everything will be great and my next tour needs to be nothing but stadiumsproblems he thought he needed to solve in order to be happy its no surprise that he was not on the contrary pete best pulled a switcheroo despite being depressed and distraught by getting kicked out of the beatles as he grew older he learned to reprioritize what he cared about and was able to measure his life in a new light because of this best grew into a happy and healthy old man with an easy life and great familythings that ironically the four beatles would spend decades struggling to achieve or maintain when we have poor valuesthat is poor standards we set for ourselves and otherswe are essentially giving fucks about the things that do not matter things that in fact make our life worse but when we choose better values we are able to divert our fucks to something bettertoward things that matter things that improve the state of our wellbeing and that generate happiness pleasure and success as side effects this in a nutshell is what selfimprovement is really about prioritizing better values choosing better things to give a fuck about because when you give better fucks you get better problems and when you get better problems you get a better life the rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that i believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt all follow the backwards law we talked about earlier in that they are negative all require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs these five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable but to me they are lifechanging the first which well look at in the next chapter is a radical form of responsibility taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life regardless of who is at fault the second is uncertainty the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs the next is failure the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon the fourth is rejection the ability to both say and hear no thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life the final value is the contemplation of ones own mortality this one is crucial because paying vigilant attention to ones own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective     chapter 5 you are always choosing imagine that somebody puts a gun to your head and tells you that you have to run 262 miles in under five hours or else hell kill you and your entire family that would suck now imagine that you bought nice shoes and running gear trained religiously for months and completed your first marathon with all of your closest family and friends cheering you on at the finish line that could potentially be one of the proudest moments of your life exact same 262 miles exact same person running them exact same pain coursing through your exact same legs but when you chose it freely and prepared for it it was a glorious and important milestone in your life when it was forced upon you against your will it was one of the most terrifying and painful experiences of your life often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it and that we are responsible for it if you are miserable in your current situation chances are its because you feel like some part of it is outside your controlthat there is a problem you have no ability to solve a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing when we feel that were choosing our problems we feel empowered when we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will we feel victimized and miserable the choice william james had problems really bad problems although born into a wealthy and prominent family from birth james suffered lifethreatening health issues an eye problem that left him temporarily blinded as a child a terrible stomach condition that caused excessive vomiting and forced him to adopt an obscure and highly sensitive diet trouble with his hearing back spasms so bad that for days at a time he often could not sit or stand upright due to his health problems james spent most of his time at home he did not have many friends and he was not particularly good at school instead he passed the days painting that was the only thing he liked and the only thing he felt particularly good at unfortunately nobody else thought he was good at it when he grew to adulthood nobody bought his work and as the years dragged on his father a wealthy businessman began ridiculing him for his laziness and his lack of talent meanwhile his younger brother henry james went on to become a worldrenowned novelist his sister alice james made a good living as a writer as well william was the family oddball the black sheep in a desperate attempt to salvage the young mans future jamess father used his business connections to get him admitted into harvard medical school it was his last chance his father told him if he screwed this up there was no hope for him but james never felt at home or at peace at harvard medicine never appealed to him he spent the whole time feeling like a fake and a fraud after all if he could not overcome his own problems how could he ever hope to have the energy to help others with theirs after touring a psychiatric facility one day james mused in his diary that he felt he had more in common with the patients than with the doctors a few years went by and again to his fathers disapproval james dropped out of medical school but rather than deal with the brunt of his fathers wrath he decided to get away he signed up to join an anthropological expedition to the amazon rain forest this was in the 1860s so transcontinental travel was difficult and dangerous if you ever played the computer game oregon trail when you were a kid it was kind of like that with the dysentery and drowning oxen and everything anyway james made it all the way to the amazon where the real adventure was to begin surprisingly his fragile health held up that whole way but once he finally made it on the first day of the expedition he promptly contracted smallpox and nearly died in the jungle then his back spasms returned painful to the point of making james unable to walk by this time he was emaciated and starved from the smallpox immobilized by his bad back and left alone in the middle of south america the rest of the expedition having gone on without him with no clear way to get homea journey that would take months and likely kill him anyway but somehow he eventually made it back to new england where he was greeted by an even more disappointed father by this point the young man was not so young anymorenearly thirty years old still unemployed a failure at everything he had attempted with a body that routinely betrayed him and was not likely to ever get better despite all the advantages and opportunities he would been given in life everything had fallen apart the only constants in his life seemed to be suffering and disappointment james fell into a deep depression and began making plans to take his own life but one night while reading lectures by the philosopher charles peirce james decided to conduct a little experiment in his diary he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life no matter what during this period he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances no matter the likelihood of failure if nothing improved in that year then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him and then he would take his own life the punch line william james went on to become the father of american psychology his work has been translated into a bazillion languages and hes regarded as one of the most influential intellectualsphilosopherspsychologists of his generation he would go on to teach at harvard and would tour much of the united states and europe giving lectures he would marry and have five children one of whom henry would become a famous biographer and win a pulitzer prize james would later refer to his little experiment as his rebirth and would credit it with everything that he later accomplished in his life there is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges this is the realization that we individually are responsible for everything in our lives no matter the external circumstances we do not always control what happens to us but we always control how we interpret what happens to us as well as how we respond whether we consciously recognize it or not we are always responsible for our experiences its impossible not to be choosing to not consciously interpret events in our lives is still an interpretation of the events of our lives choosing to not respond to the events in our lives is still a response to the events in our lives even if you get run over by a clown car and pissed on by a busload of schoolchildren its still your responsibility to interpret the meaning of the event and choose a response whether we like it or not we are always taking an active role in what is occurring to and within us we are always interpreting the meaning of every moment and every occurrence we are always choosing the values by which we live and the metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us often the same event can be good or bad depending on the metric we choose to use the point is we are always choosing whether we recognize it or not always it comes back to how in reality there is no such thing as not giving a single fuck its impossible we must all give a fuck about something to not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something the real question is what are we choosing to give a fuck about what values are we choosing to base our actions on what metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life and are those good choicesgood values and good metrics the responsibilityfault fallacy years ago when i was much younger and stupider i wrote a blog post and at the end of it i said something like and as a great philosopher once said with great power comes great responsibility it sounded nice and authoritative i could not remember who had said it and my google search had turned up nothing but i stuck it in there anyway it fit the post nicely about ten minutes later the first comment came in i think the great philosopher you are referring to is uncle ben from the movie spiderman as another great philosopher once said doh with great power comes great responsibility the last words of uncle ben before a thief whom peter parker let get away murders him on a sidewalk full of people for absolutely no explicable reason that great philosopher still we have all heard the quote it gets repeated a lotusually ironically and after about seven beers its one of those perfect quotes that sound really intelligent and yet its basically just telling you what you already know even if you have never quite thought about the matter before with great power comes great responsibility it is true but there is a better version of this quote a version that actually is profound and all you have to do is switch the nouns around with great responsibility comes great power the more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives the more power we will exercise over our lives accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them i once knew a man who was convinced that the reason no woman would date him was because he was too short he was educated interesting and goodlookinga good catch in principlebut he was absolutely convinced that women found him too short to date and because he felt that he was too short he did not often go out and try to meet women the few times he did he would home in on the smallest behaviors from any woman he talked with that could possibly indicate he was not attractive enough for her and then convince himself that she did not like him even if she really did as you can imagine his dating life sucked what he did not realize was that he had chosen the value that was hurting him height women he assumed are attracted only to height he was screwed no matter what he did this choice of value was disempowering it gave this man a really crappy problem not being tall enough in a world meant in his view for tall people there are far better values that he could have adopted in his dating life i want to date only women who like me for who i am might have been a nice place to starta metric that assesses the values of honesty and acceptance but he did not choose these values he likely was not even aware that he was choosing his value or could do so even though he did not realize it he was responsible for his own problems despite that responsibility he went on complaining but i do not have a choice he would tell the bartender there is nothing i can do women are superficial and vain and will never like me yes its every single womans fault for not liking a selfpitying shallow guy with shitty values obviously a lot of people hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for your problems is to also be at fault for your problems responsibility and fault often appear together in our culture but they are not the same thing if i hit you with my car i am both at fault and likely legally responsible to compensate you in some way even if hitting you with my car was an accident i am still responsible this is the way fault works in our society if you fuck up you are on the hook for making it right and it should be that way but there are also problems that we are not at fault for yet we are still responsible for them for example if you woke up one day and there was a newborn baby on your doorstep it would not be your fault that the baby had been put there but the baby would now be your responsibility you would have to choose what to do and whatever you ended up choosing keeping it getting rid of it ignoring it feeding it to a pit bull there would be problems associated with your choiceand you would be responsible for those as well judges do not get to choose their cases when a case goes to court the judge assigned to it did not commit the crime was not a witness to the crime and was not affected by the crime but he or she is still responsible for the crime the judge must then choose the consequences he or she must identify the metric against which the crime will be measured and make sure that the chosen metric is carried out we are responsible for experiences that are not our fault all the time this is part of life here is one way to think about the distinction between the two concepts fault is past tense responsibility is present tense fault results from choices that have already been made responsibility results from the choices you are currently making every second of every day you are choosing to read this you are choosing to think about the concepts you are choosing to accept or reject the concepts it may be my fault that you think my ideas are lame but you are responsible for coming to your own conclusions its not your fault that i chose to write this sentence but you are still responsible for choosing to read it or not there is a difference between blaming someone else for your situation and that persons actually being responsible for your situation nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you many people may be to blame for your unhappiness but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you this is because you always get to choose how you see things how you react to things how you value things you always get to choose the metric by which to measure your experiences my first girlfriend dumped me in spectacular fashion she was cheating on me with her teacher it was awesome and by awesome i mean it felt like getting punched in the stomach about 253 times to make things worse when i confronted her about it she promptly left me for him three years together down the toilet just like that i was miserable for months afterward that was to be expected but i also held her responsible for my misery which take it from me did not get me very far it just made the misery worse see i could not control her no matter how many times i called her or screamed at her or begged her to take me back or made surprise visits to her place or did other creepy and irrational exboyfriend things i could never control her emotions or her actions ultimately while she was to blame for how i felt she was never responsible for how i felt i was at some point after enough tears and alcohol my thinking began to shift and i began to understand that although she had done something horrible to me and she could be blamed for that it was now my own responsibility to make myself happy again she was never going to pop up and fix things for me i had to fix them for myself when i took that approach a few things happened first i began to improve myself i started exercising and spending more time with my friends whom i had been neglecting i started deliberately meeting new people i took a big studyabroad trip and did some volunteer work and slowly i started to feel better i still resented my ex for what she had done but at least now i was taking responsibility for my own emotions and by doing so i was choosing better valuesvalues aimed at taking care of myself learning to feel better about myself rather than aimed at getting her to fix what she would broken by the way this whole holding her responsible for my emotions thing is probably part of why she left in the first place more on that in a couple chapters then about a year later something funny began to happen as i looked back on our relationship i started to notice problems i had never noticed before problems that i was to blame for and that i could have done something to solve i realized that it was likely that i had not been a great boyfriend and that people do not just magically cheat on somebody they have been with unless they are unhappy for some reason i am not saying that this excused what my ex didnot at all but recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that i perhaps had not been the innocent victim id believed myself to be that i had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did after all people who date each other tend to have similar values and if i dated someone with shitty values for that long what did that say about me and my values i learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things its likely you are too you just do not realize it in hindsight i was able to look back and see warning signs of my exgirlfriends character signs i had chosen to ignore or brush off when i was with her that was my fault i could look back and see that i had not exactly been the boyfriend of the year to her either in fact i had often been cold and arrogant toward her other times i took her for granted and blew her off and hurt her these things were my fault too did my mistakes justify her mistake no but still i took on the responsibility of never making those same mistakes again and never overlooking the same signs again to help guarantee that i will never suffer the same consequences again i took on the responsibility of striving to make my future relationships with women that much better and i am happy to report that i have no more cheating girlfriends leaving me no more 253 stomach punches i took responsibility for my problems and improved upon them i took responsibility for my role in that unhealthy relationship and improved upon it with later relationships and you know what my ex leaving me while one of the most painful experiences i have ever had was also one of the most important and influential experiences of my life i credit it with inspiring a significant amount of personal growth i learned more from that single problem than dozens of my successes combined we all love to take responsibility for success and happiness hell we often fight over who gets to be responsible for success and happiness but taking responsibility for our problems is far more important because that is where the real learning comes from that is where the reallife improvement comes from to simply blame others is only to hurt yourself responding to tragedy but what about really awful events a lot of people can get on board with taking responsibility for workrelated problems and maybe watching too much tv when they should really be playing with their kids or being productive but when it comes to horrible tragedies they pull the emergency cord on the responsibility train and get off when it stops some things just feel too painful for them to own up to but think about it the intensity of the event does not change the underlying truth if you get robbed say you are obviously not at fault for being robbed no one would ever choose to go through that but as with the baby on your doorstep you are immediately thrust into responsibility for a lifeanddeath situation do you fight back do you panic do you freeze up do you tell the police do you try to forget it and pretend it never happened these are all choices and reactions you are responsible for making or rejecting you did not choose the robbery but its still your responsibility to manage the emotional and psychological and legal fallout of the experience in 2008 the taliban took control of the swat valley a remote part of northeastern pakistan they quickly implemented their muslim extremist agenda no television no films no women outside the house without a male escort no girls attending school by 2009 an elevenyearold pakistani girl named malala yousafzai had begun to speak out against the school ban she continued to attend her local school risking both her and her fathers lives she also attended conferences in nearby cities she wrote online how dare the taliban take away my right for education in 2012 at the age of fourteen she was shot in the face as she rode the bus home from school one day a masked taliban soldier armed with a rifle boarded the bus and asked who is malala tell me or i will shoot everyone here malala identified herself an amazing choice in and of itself and the man shot her in the head in front of all the other passengers malala went into a coma and almost died the taliban stated publicly that if she somehow survived the attempt they would kill both her and her father today malala is still alive she still speaks out against violence and oppression toward women in muslim countries now as a bestselling author in 2014 she received the nobel peace prize for her efforts it would seem that being shot in the face only gave her a larger audience and more courage than before it would have been easy for her to lie down and say i cannot do anything or i have no choice that ironically would still have been her choice but she chose the opposite a few years ago i had written about some of the ideas in this chapter on my blog and a man left a comment he said that i was shallow and superficial adding that i had no real understanding of lifes problems or human responsibility he said that his son had recently died in a car accident he accused me of not knowing what true pain was and said that i was an asshole for suggesting that he himself was responsible for the pain he felt over his sons death this man had obviously suffered pain much greater than most people ever have to confront in their lives he did not choose for his son to die nor was it his fault that his son died the responsibility for coping with that loss was given to him even though it was clearly and understandably unwanted but despite all that he was still responsible for his own emotions beliefs and actions how he reacted to his sons death was his own choice pain of one sort or another is inevitable for all of us but we get to choose what it means to and for us even in claiming that he had no choice in the matter and simply wanted his son back he was making a choiceone of many ways he could have chosen to use that pain of course i did not say any of this to him i was too busy being horrified and thinking that yes perhaps i was way in over my head and had no idea what the fuck i was talking about that is a hazard that comes with my line of work a problem that i chose and a problem that i was responsible for dealing with at first i felt awful but then after a few minutes i began to get angry his objections had little to do with what i was actually saying i told myself and what the hell just because i do not have a kid who died does not mean i have not experienced terrible pain myself but then i actually applied my own advice i chose my problem i could get mad at this man and argue with him try to outpain him with my own pain which would just make us both look stupid and insensitive or i could choose a better problem working on practicing patience understanding my readers better and keeping that man in mind every time i wrote about pain and trauma from then on and that is what i have tried to do i replied simply that i was sorry for his loss and left it at that what else can you say genetics and the hand were dealt in 2013 the bbc rounded up half a dozen teenagers with obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd and followed them as they attended intensive therapies to help them overcome their unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors there was imogen a seventeenyearold girl who had a compulsive need to tap every surface she walked past if she failed to do so she was flooded with horrible thoughts of her family dying there was josh who needed to do everything with both sides of his bodyshake a persons hand with both his right and his left hand eat his food with each hand step through a doorway with both feet and so on if he did not equalize his two sides he suffered from severe panic attacks and then there was jack a classic germophobe who refused to leave his house without wearing gloves boiled all his water before drinking it and refused to eat food not cleaned and prepared himself ocd is a terrible neurological and genetic disorder that cannot be cured at best it can be managed and as well see managing the disorder comes down to managing ones values the first thing the psychiatrists on this project do is tell the kids that they are to accept the imperfections of their compulsive desires what that means as one example is that when imogen becomes flooded with horrible thoughts of her family dying she is to accept that her family may actually die and that there is nothing she can do about it simply put she is told that what happens to her is not her fault josh is forced to accept that over the long term equalizing all of his behaviors to make them symmetrical is actually destroying his life more than occasional panic attacks would and jack is reminded that no matter what he does germs are always present and always infecting him the goal is to get the kids to recognize that their values are not rationalthat in fact their values are not even theirs but rather are the disordersand that by fulfilling these irrational values they are actually harming their ability to function in life the next step is to encourage the kids to choose a value that is more important than their ocd value and to focus on that for josh its the possibility of not having to hide his disorder from his friends and family all the time the prospect of having a normal functioning social life for imogen its the idea of taking control over her own thoughts and feelings and being happy again and for jack its the ability to leave his house for long periods of time without suffering traumatic episodes with these new values held front and center in their minds the teenagers set out on intensive desensitization exercises that force them to live out their new values panic attacks ensue tears are she would jack punches an array of inanimate objects and then immediately washes his hands but by the end of the documentary major progress has been made imogen no longer needs to tap every surface she comes across she says there are still monsters in the back of my mind and there probably always will be but they are getting quieter now josh is able to go periods of twentyfive to thirty minutes without equalizing his behaviors between both sides of his body and jack who makes perhaps the most improvement is actually able to go out to restaurants and drink out of bottles and glasses without washing them first jack sums up well what he learned i did not choose this life i did not choose this horrible horrible condition but i get to choose how to live with it i have to choose how to live with it a lot of people treat being born with a disadvantage whether ocd or small stature or something very different as though they were screwed out of something highly valuable they feel that there is nothing they can do about it so they avoid responsibility for their situation they figure i did not choose my crappy genetics so its not my fault if things go wrong and its true its not their fault but its still their responsibility back in college i had a bit of a delusional fantasy of becoming a professional poker player i won money and everything and it was fun but after almost a year of serious play i quit the lifestyle of staying up all night staring at a computer screen winning thousands of dollars one day and then losing most of it the next was not for me and it was not exactly the most healthy or emotionally stable means of earning a living but my time playing poker had a surprisingly profound influence on the way i see life the beauty of poker is that while luck is always involved luck does not dictate the longterm results of the game a person can get dealt terrible cards and beat someone who was dealt great cards sure the person who gets dealt great cards has a higher likelihood of winning the hand but ultimately the winner is determined byyup you guessed itthe choices each player makes throughout play i see life in the same terms we all get dealt cards some of us get better cards than others and while its easy to get hung up on our cards and feel we got screwed over the real game lies in the choices we make with those cards the risks we decide to take and the consequences we choose to live with people who consistently make the best choices in the situations they are given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker just as in life and its not necessarily the people with the best cards there are those who suffer psychologically and emotionally from neurological andor genetic deficiencies but this changes nothing sure they inherited a bad hand and are not to blame no more than the short guy wanting to get a date is to blame for being short or the person who got robbed is to blame for being robbed but its still their responsibility whether they choose to seek psychiatric treatment undergo therapy or do nothing the choice is ultimately theirs to make there are those who suffer through bad childhoods there are those who are abused and violated and screwed over physically emotionally financially they are not to blame for their problems and their hindrances but they are still responsiblealways responsibleto move on despite their problems and to make the best choices they can given their circumstances and let us be honest here if you were to add up all of the people who have some psychiatric disorder struggle with depression or suicidal thoughts have been subjected to neglect or abuse have dealt with tragedy or the death of a loved one and have survived serious health issues accidents or traumaif you were to round up all of those people and put them in the room well you would probably have to round up everyone because nobody makes it through life without collecting a few scars on the way out sure some people get saddled with worse problems than others and some people are legitimately victimized in horrible ways but as much as this may upset us or disturb us it ultimately changes nothing about the responsibility equation of our individual situation victimhood chic the responsibilityfault fallacy allows people to pass off the responsibility for solving their problems to others this ability to alleviate responsibility through blame gives people a temporary high and a feeling of moral righteousness unfortunately one side effect of the internet and social media is that its become easier than ever to push responsibilityfor even the tiniest of infractionsonto some other group or person in fact this kind of public blameshame game has become popular in certain crowds its even seen as cool the public sharing of injustices garners far more attention and emotional outpouring than most other events on social media rewarding people who are able to perpetually feel victimized with evergrowing amounts of attention and sympathy victimhood chic is in style on both the right and the left today among both the rich and the poor in fact this may be the first time in human history that every single demographic group has felt unfairly victimized simultaneously and they are all riding the highs of the moral indignation that comes along with it right now anyone who is offended about anythingwhether its the fact that a book about racism was assigned in a university class or that christmas trees were banned at the local mall or the fact that taxes were raised half a percent on investment fundsfeels as though they are being oppressed in some way and therefore deserve to be outraged and to have a certain amount of attention the current media environment both encourages and perpetuates these reactions because after all its good for business the writer and media commentator ryan holiday refers to this as outrage porn rather than report on real stories and real issues the media find it much easier and more profitable to find something mildly offensive broadcast it to a wide audience generate outrage and then broadcast that outrage back across the population in a way that outrages yet another part of the population this triggers a kind of echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two imaginary sides meanwhile distracting everyone from real societal problems its no wonder were more politically polarized than ever before the biggest problem with victimhood chic is that it sucks attention away from actual victims its like the boy who cried wolf the more people there are who proclaim themselves victims over tiny infractions the harder it becomes to see who the real victims actually are people get addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high being selfrighteous and morally superior feels good as political cartoonist tim kreider put it in a new york times oped outrage is like a lot of other things that feel good but over time devour us from the inside out and its even more insidious than most vices because we do not even consciously acknowledge that its a pleasure but part of living in a democracy and a free society is that we all have to deal with views and people we do not necessarily like that is simply the price we payyou could even say its the whole point of the system and it seems more and more people are forgetting that we should pick our battles carefully while simultaneously attempting to empathize a bit with the socalled enemy we should approach the news and media with a healthy dose of skepticism and avoid painting those who disagree with us with a broad brush we should prioritize values of being honest fostering transparency and welcoming doubt over the values of being right feeling good and getting revenge these democratic values are harder to maintain amidst the constant noise of a networked world but we must accept the responsibility and nurture them regardless the future stability of our political systems may depend on it there is no how a lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like okay but how i get that my values suck and that i avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that i am an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience i experiencebut how do i change and to this i say in my best yoda impersonation do or do not there is no how  you are already choosing in every moment of every day what to give a fuck about so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else it really is that simple its just not easy its not easy because you are going to feel like a loser a fraud a dumbass at first you are going to be nervous you are going to freak out you may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process these are all side effects of changing your values of changing the fucks you are giving but they are inevitable its simple but really really hard let us look at some of these side effects you are going to feel uncertain i guarantee it should i really give this up is this the right thing to do giving up a value you have depended on for years is going to feel disorienting as if you do not really know right from wrong anymore this is hard but its normal next you will feel like a failure you have spent half your life measuring yourself by that old value so when you change your priorities change your metrics and stop behaving in the same way you will fail to meet that old trusted metric and thus immediately feel like some sort of fraud or nobody this is also normal and also uncomfortable and certainly you will weather rejections many of the relationships in your life were built around the values you have been keeping so the moment you change those valuesthe moment you decide that studying is more important than partying that getting married and having a family is more important than rampant sex that working a job you believe in is more important than moneyyour turnaround will reverberate out through your relationships and many of them will blow up in your face this too is normal and this too will be uncomfortable these are necessary though painful side effects of choosing to place your fucks elsewhere in a place far more important and more worthy of your energies as you reassess your values you will be met with internal and external resistance along the way more than anything you will feel uncertain you will wonder if what you are doing is wrong but as well see this is a good thing     chapter 6 you are wrong about everything but so am i five hundred years ago cartographers believed that california was an island doctors believed that slicing a persons arm open or causing bleeding anywhere could cure disease scientists believed that fire was made out of something called phlogiston women believed that rubbing dog urine on their face had antiaging benefits astronomers believed that the sun revolved around the earth when i was a little boy i used to think mediocre was a kind of vegetable that i did not want to eat i thought my brother had found a secret passageway in my grandmothers house because he could get outside without having to leave the bathroom spoiler alert there was a window i also thought that when my friend and his family visited washington because they had somehow traveled back in time to when the dinosaurs lived because after all because was a long time ago as a teenager i told everybody that i did not care about anything when the truth was i cared about way too much other people ruled my world without my even knowing i thought happiness was a destiny and not a choice i thought love was something that just happened not something that you worked for i thought being cool had to be practiced and learned from others rather than invented for oneself when i was with my first girlfriend i thought we would be together forever and then when that relationship ended i thought id never feel the same way about a woman again and then when i felt the same way about a woman again i thought that love sometimes just was not enough and then i realized that each individual gets to decide what is enough and that love can be whatever we let it be every step of the way i was wrong about everything throughout my life i have been flatout wrong about myself others society culture the world the universeeverything and i hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life just as present mark can look back on past marks every flaw and mistake one day future mark will look back on present marks assumptions including the contents of this book and notice similar flaws and that will be a good thing because that will mean i have grown there is a famous michael jordan quote about him failing over and over and over again and that is why he succeeded well i am always wrong about everything over and over and over again and that is why my life improves growth is an endlessly iterative process when we learn something new we do not go from wrong to right rather we go from wrong to slightly less wrong and when we learn something additional we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that and then to even less wrong than that and so on we are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection we should not seek to find the ultimate right answer for ourselves but rather we should seek to chip away at the ways that were wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow when viewed from this perspective personal growth can actually be quite scientific our values are our hypotheses this behavior is good and important that other behavior is not our actions are the experiments the resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data there is no correct dogma or perfect ideology there is only what your experience has shown you to be right for youand even then that experience is probably somewhat wrong too and because you and i and everybody else all have differing needs and personal histories and life circumstances we will all inevitably come to differing correct answers about what our lives mean and how they should be lived my correct answer involves traveling alone for years on end living in obscure places and laughing at my own farts or at least that was the correct answer up until recently that answer will change and evolve because i change and evolve and as i grow older and more experienced i chip away at how wrong i am becoming less and less wrong every day many people become so obsessed with being right about their life that they never end up actually living it a certain woman is single and lonely and wants a partner but she never gets out of the house and does anything about it a certain man works his ass off and believes he deserves a promotion but he never explicitly says that to his boss they are told that they are afraid of failure of rejection of someone saying no but that is not it sure rejection hurts failure sucks but there are particular certainties that we hold on tocertainties that were afraid to question or let go of values that have given our lives meaning over the years that woman does not get out there and date because she would be forced to confront her beliefs about her own desirability that man does not ask for the promotion because he would have to confront his beliefs about what his skills are actually worth its easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive that nobody appreciates your talents than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure beliefs of this sortthat i am not attractive enough so why bother or that my boss is an asshole so why botherare designed to give us moderate comfort now by mortgaging greater happiness and success later on they are terrible longterm strategies yet we cling to them because we assume were right because we assume we already know what is supposed to happen in other words we assume we know how the story ends certainty is the enemy of growth nothing is for certain until it has already happenedand even then its still debatable that is why accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place instead of striving for certainty we should be in constant search of doubt doubt about our own beliefs doubt about our own feelings doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves instead of looking to be right all the time we should be looking for how were wrong all the time because we are being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change being wrong brings the opportunity for growth it means not cutting your arm open to cure a cold or splashing dog piss on your face to look young again it means not thinking mediocre is a vegetable and not being afraid to care about things because here is something that is weird but true we do not actually know what a positive or negative experience is some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating do not trust your conception of positivenegative experiences all that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what does not and that is not worth much just as we look back in horror at the lives of people five hundred years ago i imagine people five hundred years from now will laugh at us and our certainties today they will laugh at how we let our money and our jobs define our lives they will laugh at how we were afraid to show appreciation for those who matter to us most yet heaped praise on public figures who did not deserve anything they will laugh at our rituals and superstitions our worries and our wars they will gawk at our cruelty they will study our art and argue over our history they will understand truths about us of which none of us are yet aware and they too will be wrong just less wrong than we were architects of our own beliefs try this take a random person and put them in a room with some buttons to push then tell them that if they do something specificsome undefined something that they have to figure outa light will flash on indicating that they have won a point then tell them to see how many points they can earn within a thirtyminute period when psychologists have done this what happens is what you might expect people sit down and start mashing buttons at random until eventually the light comes on to tell them they got a point logically they then try repeating whatever they were doing to get more points except now the lights not coming on so they start experimenting with more complicated sequencespress this button three times then this button once then wait five seconds andding another point but eventually that stops working perhaps it does not have to do with buttons at all they think perhaps it has to do with how i am sitting or what i am touching maybe it has to do with my feet ding another point yeah maybe its my feet and then i press another button ding generally within ten to fifteen minutes each person has figured out the specific sequence of behaviors required to net more points its usually something weird like standing on one foot or memorizing a long sequence of buttons pressed in a specific amount of time while facing a certain direction but here is the funny part the points really are random there is no sequence there is no pattern just a light that keeps coming on with a ding and people doing cartwheels thinking that what they are doing is giving them points sadism aside the point of the experiment is to show how quickly the human mind is capable of coming up with and believing in a bunch of bullshit that is not real and it turns out were all really good at it every person leaves that room convinced that he or she nailed the experiment and won the game they all believe that they discovered the perfect sequence of buttons that earned them their points but the methods they come up with are as unique as the individuals themselves one man came up with a long sequence of buttonpushing that made no sense to anyone but himself one girl came to believe that she had to tap the ceiling a certain number of times to get points when she left the room she was exhausted from jumping up and down our brains are meaning machines what we understand as meaning is generated by the associations our brain makes between two or more experiences we press a button then we see a light go on we assume the button caused the light to go on this at its core is the basis of meaning button light light button we see a chair we note that its gray our brain then draws the association between the color gray and the object chair and forms meaning the chair is gray our minds are constantly whirring generating more and more associations to help us understand and control the environment around us everything about our experiences both external and internal generates new associations and connections within our minds everything from the words on this page to the grammatical concepts you use to decipher them to the dirty thoughts your mind wanders into when my writing becomes boring or repetitiveeach of these thoughts impulses and perceptions is composed of thousands upon thousands of neural connections firing in conjunction alighting your mind in a blaze of knowledge and understanding but there are two problems first the brain is imperfect we mistake things we see and hear we forget things or misinterpret events quite easily second once we create meaning for ourselves our brains are designed to hold on to that meaning we are biased toward the meaning our mind has made and we do not want to let go of it even if we see evidence that contradicts the meaning we created we often ignore it and keep on believing anyway the comedian emo philips once said i used to think the human brain was the most wonderful organ in my body then i realized who was telling me this the unfortunate fact is most of what we come to know and believe is the product of the innate inaccuracies and biases present in our brains many or even most of our values are products of events that are not representative of the world at large or are the result of a totally misconceived past the result of all this most of our beliefs are wrong or to be more exact all beliefs are wrongsome are just less wrong than others the human mind is a jumble of inaccuracy and while this may make you uncomfortable its an incredibly important concept to accept as well see be careful what you believe in 1988 while in therapy the journalist and feminist author meredith maran came to a startling realization her father had sexually abused her as a child it was a shock to her a repressed memory she had spent most of her adult life oblivious to but at the age of thirtyseven she confronted her father and also told her family what had happened merediths news horrified her entire family her father immediately denied having done anything some family members sided with meredith others sided with her father the family tree was split in two and the pain that had defined merediths relationship with her father since long before her accusation now spread like a mold across its branches it tore everyone apart then in 1996 meredith came to another startling realization her father actually had not sexually abused her i know oops she with the help of a wellintentioned therapist had actually invented the memory consumed by guilt she spent the rest of her fathers life attempting to reconcile with him and other family members through constant apologizing and explaining but it was too late her father passed away and her family would never be the same it turned out meredith was not alone as she describes in her autobiography my lie a true story of false memory throughout the 1980s many women accused male family members of sexual abuse only to turn around and recant years later similarly there was a whole swath of people who claimed during that same decade that there were satanic cults abusing children yet despite police investigations in dozens of cities police never found any evidence of the crazy practices described why were people suddenly inventing memories of horrible abuse in families and cults and why was it all happening then in the 1980s ever play the telephone game as a kid you know you say something in one persons ear and it gets passed through like ten people and what the last person hears is completely unrelated to what you started with that is basically how our memories work we experience something then we remember it slightly differently a few days later as if it had been whispered and misheard then we tell somebody about it and have to fill in a couple of the plot holes with our own embellishments to make sure everything makes sense and were not crazy and then we come to believe those little filledin mental gaps and so we tell those the next time too except they are not real so we get them a little bit wrong and were drunk one night a year later when we tell the story so we embellish it a little bit moreokay let us be honest we completely make up about onethird of it but when were sober the next week we do not want to admit that were a big fat liar so we go along with the revised and newly expanded drunkard version of our story and five years later our absolutely sweartogod swearonmymothersgrave truerthantrue story is at most 50 percent true we all do this you do i do no matter how honest and wellintentioned we are were in a perpetual state of misleading ourselves and others for no other reason than that our brain is designed to be efficient not accurate not only does our memory sucksuck to the point that eyewitness testimony is not necessarily taken seriously in court casesbut our brain functions in a horribly biased way how so well our brain is always trying to make sense of our current situation based on what we already believe and have already experienced every new piece of information is measured against the values and conclusions we already have as a result our brain is always biased toward what we feel to be true in that moment so when we have a great relationship with our sister well interpret most of our memories about her in a positive light but when the relationship sours well often come to see those exact same memories differently reinventing them in such a way as to explain our presentday anger toward her that sweet gift she gave us last christmas is now remembered as patronizing and condescending that time she forgot to invite us to her lake house is now seen not as an innocent mistake but as horrible negligence merediths fake abuse story makes far more sense when we understand the values in which her beliefs arose first of all meredith had had a strained and difficult relationship with her father throughout most of her life second meredith had had a series of failed intimate relationships with men including a failed marriage so already in terms of her values close relationships with men were not doing so hot then in the early 1980s meredith became a radical feminist and began doing research into child abuse she was confronted with horrific story after horrific story of abuse and she dealt with incest survivorsusually little girlsfor years on end she also reported extensively on a number of inaccurate studies that came out around that timestudies that it later turned out grossly overestimated the prevalence of child molestation the most famous study reported that a third of adult women had been sexually molested as children a number that has since been shown to be false and on top of all of this meredith fell in love and began a relationship with another woman an incest survivor meredith developed a codependent and toxic relationship with her partner one in which meredith continually tried to save the other woman from her traumatic past her partner also used her traumatic past as a weapon of guilt to earn merediths affection more on this and boundaries in chapter 8 meanwhile merediths relationship with her father deteriorated even further he was not exactly thrilled that she was now in a lesbian relationship and she was attending therapy at an almost compulsive rate her therapists who had their own values and beliefs driving their behavior regularly insisted that it could not simply be merediths highly stressful reporting job or her poor relationships that were making her so unhappy it must be something else something deeper around this time a new form of treatment called repressed memory therapy was becoming hugely popular this therapy involved a therapist putting a client into a trancelike state where she was encouraged to root out and reexperience forgotten childhood memories these memories were often benign but the idea was that at least a few of them would be traumatic as well so there you have poor meredith miserable and researching incest and child molestation every day angry at her father having endured an entire lifetime of failed relationships with men and the only person who seems to understand her or love her is another woman who is a survivor of incest oh and she is lying on a couch crying every other day with a therapist demanding over and over that she remember something she cannot remember and voila you have a perfect recipe for an invented memory of sexual abuse that never happened our minds biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they will cohere with all of our previous experiences feelings and beliefs but often we run into life situations where past and present do not cohere on such occasions what were experiencing in the moment flies in the face of everything we have accepted as true and reasonable about our past in an effort to achieve coherence our mind will sometimes in cases like that invent false memories by linking our present experiences with that imagined past our mind allows us to maintain whatever meaning we already established as noted earlier merediths story is not unique in fact in the 1980s and early 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances many of them went to prison for it for people who were dissatisfied with their lives these suggestive explanations combined with the sensationalizing mediathere were veritable epidemics of sexual abuse and satanic violence going on and you could be a victim toogave peoples unconscious minds the incentive to fudge their memories a bit and explain their current suffering in a way that allowed them to be victims and avoid responsibility repressed memory therapy then acted as a means to pull these unconscious desires out and put them into a seemingly tangible form of a memory this process and the state of mind it resulted in became so common that a name was introduced for it false memory syndrome it changed the way courtrooms operate thousands of therapists were sued and lost their licenses repressed memory therapy fell out of practice and was replaced by more practical methods recent research has only reinforced the painful lesson of that era our beliefs are malleable and our memories are horribly unreliable there is a lot of conventional wisdom out there telling you to trust yourself to go with your gut and all sorts of other pleasantsounding cliches but perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less after all if our hearts and minds are so unreliable maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more if were all wrong all the time then is not selfskepticism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress this may sound scary and selfdestructive but its actually quite the opposite its not only the safer option but its liberating as well the dangers of pure certainty erin sits across from me at the sushi restaurant and tries to explain why she does not believe in death its been almost three hours and she is eaten exactly four cucumber rolls and drunk an entire bottle of sake by herself in fact she is about halfway through bottle number two now its four of the clock on a tuesday afternoon i did not invite her here she found out where i was via the internet and flew out to come find me again she is done this before you see erin is convinced that she can cure death but she is also convinced that she needs my help to do it but not my help in like a business sense if she just needed some pr advice or something that would be one thing no its more than that she needs me to be her boyfriend why after three hours of questioning and a bottle and a half of sake it still is not clear my fiancee was with us in the restaurant by the way erin thought it important that she be included in the discussion erin wanted her to know that she was willing to share me and that my girlfriend now wife should not feel threatened by her i met erin at a selfhelp seminar in 2008 she seemed like a nice enough person a little bit on the woowoo new agey side of things but she was a lawyer and had gone to an ivy league school and was clearly smart and she laughed at my jokes and thought i was cuteso of course knowing me i slept with her a month later she invited me to uproot across the country and move in with her this struck me as somewhat of a red flag and so i tried to break things off with her she responded by saying that she would kill herself if i refused to be with her okay so make that two red flags i promptly blocked her from my email and all my devices this would slow her down but not stop her years before i met her erin had gotten into a car accident and nearly died actually she had medically died for a few momentsall brain activity had stoppedbut she had somehow miraculously been revived when she came back she claimed everything had changed she became a very spiritual person she became interested in and started believing in energy healing and angels and universal consciousness and tarot cards she also believed that she had become a healer and an empath and that she could see the future and for whatever reason upon meeting me she decided that she and i were destined to save the world together to cure death as she put it after id blocked her she began to create new email addresses sometimes sending me as many as a dozen angry emails in a single day she created fake facebook and twitter accounts that she used to harass me as well as people close to me she created a website identical to mine and wrote dozens of articles claiming that i was her exboyfriend and that i had lied to her and cheated her that i had promised to marry her and that she and i belonged together when i contacted her to take the site down she said that she would take it down only if i flew to california to be with her this was her idea of a compromise and through all of this her justification was the same i was destined to be with her that god had preordained it that she literally woke up in the middle of the night to the voices of angels commanding that our special relationship was to be the harbinger of a new age of permanent peace on earth yes she really told me this by the time we were sitting in that sushi restaurant together there had been thousands of emails whether i responded or did not respond replied respectfully or replied angrily nothing ever changed her mind never changed her beliefs never budged this had gone on for over seven years by then and counting and so it was in that small sushi restaurant with erin guzzling sake and babbling for hours about how she would cured her cats kidney stones with energy tapping that something occurred to me erin is a selfimprovement junkie she spends tens of thousands of dollars on books and seminars and courses and the craziest part of all this is that erin embodies all the lessons she is learned to a t she has her dream she stays persistent with it she visualizes and takes action and weathers the rejections and failures and gets up and tries again she is relentlessly positive she thinks pretty damn highly of herself i mean she claims to heal cats the same way jesus healed lazaruscome the fuck on and yet her values are so fucked that none of this matters the fact that she does everything right does not make her right there is a certainty in her that refuses to relinquish itself she has even told me this in so many words that she knows her fixation is completely irrational and unhealthy and is making both her and me unhappy but for some reason it feels so right to her that she cannot ignore it and she cannot stop in the mid1990s psychologist roy baumeister began researching the concept of evil basically he looked at people who do bad things and at why they do them at the time it was assumed that people did bad things because they felt horrible about themselvesthat is they had low selfesteem one of baumeisters first surprising findings was that this was often not true in fact it was usually the opposite some of the worst criminals felt pretty damn good about themselves and it was this feeling good about themselves in spite of the reality around them that gave them the sense of justification for hurting and disrespecting others for individuals to feel justified in doing horrible things to other people they must feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness in their own beliefs and deservedness racists do racist things because they are certain about their genetic superiority religious fanatics blow themselves up and murder dozens of people because they are certain of their place in heaven as martyrs men rape and abuse women out of their certainty that they are entitled to womens bodies evil people never believe that they are evil rather they believe that everyone else is evil in controversial experiments now simply known as the milgram experiments named for the psychologist stanley milgram researchers told normal people that they were to punish other volunteers for breaking various rules and punish them they did sometimes escalating the punishment to the point of physical abuse almost none of the punishers objected or asked for explanation on the contrary many of them seemed to relish the certainty of the moral righteousness bestowed upon them by the experiments the problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more and worse insecurity many people have an unshakable certainty in their ability at their job or in the amount of salary they should be making but that certainty makes them feel worse not better they see others getting promoted over them and they feel slighted they feel unappreciated and underacknowledged even a behavior as simple as sneaking a peek at your boyfriends text messages or asking a friend what people are saying about you is driven by insecurity and that aching desire to be certain you can check your boyfriends text messages and find nothing but that is rarely the end of it then you may start wondering if he has a second phone you can feel slighted and stepped over at work to explain why you missed out on a promotion but then that causes you to distrust your coworkers and secondguess everything they say to you and how you think they feel about you which in turn makes you even less likely to get promoted you can keep pursuing that special someone you are supposed to be with but with each rebuffed advance and each lonely night you only begin to question more and more what you are doing wrong and its in these moments of insecurity of deep despair that we become susceptible to an insidious entitlement believing that we deserve to cheat a little to get our way that other people deserve to be punished that we deserve to take what we want and sometimes violently its the backwards law again the more you try to be certain about something the more uncertain and insecure you will feel but the converse is true as well the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you do not know uncertainty removes our judgments of others it preempts the unnecessary stereotyping and biases that we otherwise feel when we see somebody on tv in the office or on the street uncertainty also relieves us of our judgment of ourselves we do not know if were lovable or not we do not know how attractive we are we do not know how successful we could potentially become the only way to achieve these things is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth as the old adage goes the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing we cannot learn anything without first not knowing something the more we admit we do not know the more opportunities we gain to learn our values are imperfect and incomplete and to assume that they are perfect and complete is to put us in a dangerously dogmatic mindset that breeds entitlement and avoids responsibility the only way to solve our problems is to first admit that our actions and beliefs up to this point have been wrong and are not working this openness to being wrong must exist for any real change or growth to take place before we can look at our values and prioritizations and change them into better healthier ones we must first become uncertain of our current values we must intellectually strip them away see their faults and biases see how they do not fit in with much of the rest of the world to stare our own ignorance in the face and concede because our own ignorance is greater than us all mansons law of avoidance chances are you have heard some form of parkinsons law work expands so as to fill up the time available for its completion you have also undoubtedly heard of murphys law whatever can go wrong will go wrong well next time you are at a swanky cocktail party and you want to impress somebody try dropping mansons law of avoidance on them the more something threatens your identity the more you will avoid it that means the more something threatens to change how you view yourself how successfulunsuccessful you believe yourself to be how well you see yourself living up to your values the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it there is a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world anything that shakes up that comforteven if it could potentially make your life betteris inherently scary mansons law applies to both good and bad things in life making a million dollars could threaten your identity just as much as losing all your money becoming a famous rock star could threaten your identity just as much as losing your job this is why people are often so afraid of successfor the exact same reason they are afraid of failure it threatens who they believe themselves to be you avoid writing that screenplay you have always dreamed of because doing so would call into question your identity as a practical insurance adjuster you avoid talking to your husband about being more adventurous in the bedroom because that conversation would challenge your identity as a good moral woman you avoid telling your friend that you do not want to see him anymore because ending the friendship would conflict with your identity as a nice forgiving person these are good important opportunities that we consistently pass up because they threaten to change how we view and feel about ourselves they threaten the values that we have chosen and have learned to live up to i had a friend who for the longest time talked about putting his artwork online and trying to make a go of it as a professional or at least semiprofessional artist he talked about it for years he saved up money he even built a few different websites and uploaded his portfolio but he never launched there was always some reason the resolution on his work was not good enough or he had just painted something better or he was not in a position to dedicate enough time to it yet years passed and he never did give up his real job why because despite dreaming about making a living through his art the real potential of becoming an artist nobody likes was far far scarier than remaining an artist nobodys heard of at least he was comfortable with and used to being an artist nobodys heard of i had another friend who was a party guy always going out drinking and chasing girls after years of living the high life he found himself terribly lonely depressed and unhealthy he wanted to give up his party lifestyle he spoke with a fierce jealousy of those of us who were in relationships and more settled down than he was yet he never changed for years he went on empty night after empty night bottle after bottle always some excuse always some reason he could not slow down giving up that lifestyle threatened his identity too much the party guy was all he knew how to be to give that up would be like committing psychological harakiri we all have values for ourselves we protect these values we try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them even if we do not mean to that is how our brain is wired as noted before were unfairly biased toward what we already know what we believe to be certain if i believe i am a nice guy ill avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief if i believe i am an awesome cook ill seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again the belief always takes precedence until we change how we view ourselves what we believe we are and are not we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety we cannot change in this way knowing yourself or finding yourself can be dangerous it can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations it can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities i say do not find yourself i say never know who you are because that is what keeps you striving and discovering and it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others kill yourself buddhism argues that your idea of who you are is an arbitrary mental construction and that you should let go of the idea that you exist at all that the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you and thus you are better off letting go of everything in a sense you could say that buddhism encourages you to not give a fuck it sounds wonky but there are some psychological benefits to this approach to life when we let go of the stories we tell about ourselves to ourselves we free ourselves up to actually act and fail and grow when someone admits to herself you know maybe i am not good at relationships then she is suddenly free to act and end her bad marriage she has no identity to protect by staying in a miserable crappy marriage just to prove something to herself when the student admits to himself you know maybe i am not a rebel maybe i am just scared then hes free to be ambitious again he has no reason to feel threatened by pursuing his academic dreams and maybe failing when the insurance adjuster admits to himself you know maybe there is nothing unique or special about my dreams or my job then hes free to give that screenplay an honest go and see what happens i have both some good news and some bad news for you there is little that is unique or special about your problems that is why letting go is so liberating there is a kind of selfabsorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty when you assume that your plane is the one that is going to crash or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at or that you are the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore you are implicitly telling yourself i am the exception i am unlike everybody else i am different and special this is narcissism pure and simple you feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently that your problems have some unique math to them that does not obey the laws of the physical universe my recommendation do not be special do not be unique redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure instead measure yourself by more mundane identities a student a partner a friend a creator the narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself the more everything will seem to threaten you for that reason define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible this often means giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself that you are uniquely intelligent or spectacularly talented or intimidatingly attractive or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine this means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you are somehow owed something by this world this means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you have been sustaining yourself on for years like a junkie giving up the needle you are going to go through withdrawal when you start giving these things up but you will come out the other side so much better how to be a little less certain of yourself questioning ourselves and doubting our own thoughts and beliefs is one of the hardest skills to develop but it can be done here are some questions that will help you breed a little more uncertainty in your life question 1 what if i am wrong a friend of mine recently got engaged to be married the guy who proposed to her is pretty solid he does not drink he does not hit her or mistreat her hes friendly and has a good job but since the engagement my friends brother has been admonishing her nonstop about her immature life choices warning her that she is going to hurt herself with this guy that she is making a mistake that she is being irresponsible and whenever my friend asks her brother what is your problem why does this bother you so much he acts as though there is no problem that nothing about the engagement bothers him that hes just trying to be helpful and look out for his little sister but its clear that something does bother him perhaps its his own insecurities about getting married perhaps its a sibling rivalry thing perhaps its jealousy perhaps hes just so caught up in his own victimhood that he does not know how to show happiness for others without trying to make them feel miserable first as a general rule were all the worlds worst observers of ourselves when were angry or jealous or upset were oftentimes the last ones to figure it out and the only way to figure it out is to put cracks in our armor of certainty by consistently questioning how wrong we might be about ourselves am i jealousand if i am then why am i angry is she right and i am just protecting my ego questions like these need to become a mental habit in many cases the simple act of asking ourselves such questions generates the humility and compassion needed to resolve a lot of our issues but its important to note that just because you ask yourself if you have the wrong idea does not necessarily mean that you do if your husband beats the crap out of you for burning the pot roast and you ask yourself if you are wrong to believe hes mistreating youwell sometimes you are right the goal is merely to ask the question and entertain the thought at the moment not to hate yourself its worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life you must be wrong about something if you are sitting there miserable day after day then that means you are already wrong about something major in your life and until you are able to question yourself to find it nothing will change question 2 what would it mean if i were wrong many people are able to ask themselves if they are wrong but few are able to go the extra step and admit what it would mean if they were wrong that is because the potential meaning behind our wrongness is often painful not only does it call into question our values but it forces us to consider what a different contradictory value could potentially look and feel like aristotle wrote it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it being able to look at and evaluate different values without necessarily adopting them is perhaps the central skill required in changing ones own life in a meaningful way as for my friends brother his question to himself should be what would it mean if i were wrong about my sisters wedding often the answer to such a question is pretty straightforward and some form of i am being a selfishinsecurenarcissistic asshole if he is wrong and his sisters engagement is fine and healthy and happy there is really no way to explain his own behavior other than through his own insecurities and fuckedup values he assumes that he knows what is best for his sister and that she cannot make major life decisions for herself he assumes that he has the right and responsibility to make decisions for her he is certain that hes right and everyone else must be wrong even once uncovered whether in my friends brother or in ourselves that sort of entitlement is hard to admit it hurts that is why few people ask the difficult questions but probing questions are necessary in order to get at the core problems that are motivating his and our dickish behavior question 3 would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem for both myself and others this is the litmus test for determining whether we have got some pretty solid values going on or were totally neurotic fuckwads taking our fucks out on everyone including ourselves the goal here is to look at which problem is better because after all as disappointment panda said lifes problems are endless my friends brother what are his options a   continue causing drama and friction within the family complicating what should otherwise be a happy moment and damage the trust and respect he has with his sister all because he has a hunch some might call it an intuition that this guy is bad for her b   mistrust his own ability to determine what is right or wrong for his sisters life and remain humble trust her ability to make her own decisions and even if he does not live with the results out of his love and respect for her most people choose option a that is because option a is the easier path it requires little thought no secondguessing and zero tolerance of decisions other people make that you do not like it also creates the most misery for everyone involved its option b that sustains healthy and happy relationships built on trust and respect its option b that forces people to remain humble and admit ignorance its option b that allows people to grow beyond their insecurities and recognize situations where they are being impulsive or unfair or selfish but option b is hard and painful so most people do not choose it my friends brother in protesting her engagement entered into an imaginary battle with himself sure he believed he was trying to protect his sister but as we have seen beliefs are arbitrary worse yet they are often made up after the fact to justify whatever values and metrics we have chosen for ourselves the truth is he would rather fuck up his relationship with his sister than consider that he might be wrongeven though the latter could help him to grow out of the insecurities that made him wrong in the first place i try to live with few rules but one that i have adopted over the years is this if its down to me being screwed up or everybody else being screwed up it is far far far more likely that i am the one who is screwed up i have learned this from experience i have been the asshole acting out based on my own insecurities and flawed certainties more times than i can count its not pretty that is not to say there are not certain ways in which most people are screwed up and that is not to say that there are not times when you will be more right than most other people that is simply reality if it feels like its you versus the world chances are its really just you versus yourself     chapter 7 failure is the way forward i really mean it when i say it i was fortunate i graduated college in 2007 just in time for the financial collapse and great recession and attempted to enter the worst job market in more than eighty years around the same time i found out that the person who was subletting one of the rooms in my apartment had not paid any rent for three months when confronted about this she cried and then disappeared leaving my other roommate and me to cover everything goodbye savings i spent the next six months living on a friends couch stringing together odd jobs and trying to stay in as little debt as possible while looking for a real job i say i was fortunate because i entered the adult world already a failure i started out at rock bottom that is basically everybodys biggest fear later on in life when confronted with starting a new business or changing careers or quitting an awful job and i got to experience it right out of the gates things could only get better so yeah lucky when you are sleeping on a smelly futon and have to count coins to figure out whether you can afford mcdonalds this week and you have sent out twenty resumes without hearing a single word back then starting a blog and a stupid internet business does not sound like such a scary idea if every project i started failed if every post i wrote went unread id only be back exactly where i started so why not try failure itself is a relative concept if my metric had been to become an anarchocommunist revolutionary then my complete failure to make any money between 2007 and 2008 would have been a raving success but if like most people my metric had been to simply find a first serious job that could pay some bills right out of school i was a dismal failure i grew up in a wealthy family money was never a problem on the contrary i grew up in a wealthy family where money was more often used to avoid problems than solve them i was again fortunate because this taught me at an early age that making money by itself was a lousy metric for myself you could make plenty of money and be miserable just as you could be broke and be pretty happy therefore why use money as a means to measure my selfworth instead my value was something else it was freedom autonomy the idea of being an entrepreneur had always appealed to me because i hated being told what to do and preferred to do things my way the idea of working on the internet appealed to me because i could do it from anywhere and work whenever i wanted i asked myself a simple question would i rather make decent money and work a job i hated or play at internet entrepreneur and be broke for a while the answer was immediate and clear for me the latter i then asked myself if i try this thing and fail in a few years and have to go get a job anyway will i have really lost anything the answer was no instead of a broke and unemployed twentytwoyearold with no experience id be a broke and unemployed twentyfiveyearold with no experience who cares with this value to not pursue my own projects became the failurenot a lack of money not sleeping on friends and familys couches which i continued to do for most of the next two years and not an empty resume the failuresuccess paradox when pablo picasso was an old man he was sitting in a cafe in spain doodling on a used napkin he was nonchalant about the whole thing drawing whatever amused him in that momentkind of the same way teenage boys draw penises on bathroom stallsexcept this was picasso so his bathroomstall penises were more like cubistimpressionist awesomeness laced on top of faint coffee stains anyway some woman sitting near him was looking on in awe after a few moments picasso finished his coffee and crumpled up the napkin to throw away as he left the woman stopped him wait she said can i have that napkin you were just drawing on ill pay you for it sure picasso replied twenty thousand dollars the womans head jolted back as if he had just flung a brick at her what it took you like two minutes to draw that no madam picasso said it took me over sixty years to draw this he stuffed the napkin in his pocket and walked out of the cafe improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you have failed at something if someone is better than you at something then its likely because she has failed at it more than you have if someone is worse than you its likely because he has not been through all of the painful learning experiences you have if you think about a young child trying to learn to walk that child will fall down and hurt itself hundreds of times but at no point does that child ever stop and think oh i guess walking just is not for me i am not good at it avoiding failure is something we learn at some later point in life i am sure a lot of it comes from our education system which judges rigorously based on performance and punishes those who do not do well another large share of it comes from overbearing or critical parents who do not let their kids screw up on their own often enough and instead punish them for trying anything new or not preordained and then we have all the mass media that constantly expose us to stellar success after success while not showing us the thousands of hours of dull practice and tedium that were required to achieve that success at some point most of us reach a place where were afraid to fail where we instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what were already good at this confines us and stifles us we can be truly successful only at something were willing to fail at if were unwilling to fail then were unwilling to succeed a lot of this fear of failure comes from having chosen shitty values for instance if i measure myself by the standard make everyone i meet like me i will be anxious because failure is 100 percent defined by the actions of others not by my own actions i am not in control thus my selfworth is at the mercy of judgments by others whereas if i instead adopt the metric improve my social life i can live up to my value of good relations with others regardless of how other people respond to me my selfworth is based on my own behaviors and happiness shitty values as we saw in chapter 4 involve tangible external goals outside of our control the pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety and even if we manage to achieve them they leave us feeling empty and lifeless because once they are achieved there are no more problems to solve better values as we saw are processoriented something like express myself honestly to others a metric for the value honesty is never completely finished its a problem that must continuously be reengaged every new conversation every new relationship brings new challenges and opportunities for honest expression the value is an ongoing lifelong process that defies completion if your metric for the value success by worldly standards is buy a house and a nice car and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it once its achieved the metric has nothing left to give you then say hello to your midlife crisis because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you there are no other opportunities to keep growing and improving and yet its growth that generates happiness not a long list of arbitrary achievements in this sense goals as they are conventionally definedgraduate from college buy a lake house lose fifteen poundsare limited in the amount of happiness they can produce in our lives they may be helpful when pursuing quick shortterm benefits but as guides for the overall trajectory of our life they suck picasso remained prolific his entire life he lived into his nineties and continued to produce art up until his final years had his metric been become famous or make a buttload of money in the art world or paint one thousand pictures he would have stagnated at some point along the way he would have been overcome by anxiety or selfdoubt he likely would not have improved and innovated his craft in the ways he did decade after decade the reason for picassos success is exactly the same reason why as an old man he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a cafe his underlying value was simple and humble and it was endless it was the value honest expression and this is what made that napkin so valuable pain is part of the process in the 1950s a polish psychologist named kazimierz dabrowski studied world war ii survivors and how they would coped with traumatic experiences in the war this was poland so things had been pretty gruesome these people had experienced or witnessed mass starvation bombings that turned cities to rubble the holocaust the torture of prisoners of war and the rape andor murder of family members if not by the nazis then a few years later by the soviets as dabrowski studied the survivors he noticed something both surprising and amazing a sizable percentage of them believed that the wartime experiences they would suffered although painful and indeed traumatic had actually caused them to become better more responsible and yes even happier people many described their lives before the war as if they would been different people then ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones lazy and consumed by petty problems entitled to all they would been given after the war they felt more confident more sure of themselves more grateful and unfazed by lifes trivialities and petty annoyances obviously their experiences had been horrific and these survivors were not happy about having had to experience them many of them still suffered from the emotional scars the lashings of war had left on them but some of them had managed to leverage those scars to transform themselves in positive and powerful ways and they are not alone in that reversal for many of us our proudest achievements come in the face of the greatest adversity our pain often makes us stronger more resilient more grounded many cancer survivors for example report feeling stronger and more grateful after winning their battle to survive many military personnel report a mental resilience gained from withstanding the dangerous environments of being in a war zone dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind rather they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth and to deny that pain is to deny our own potential just as one must suffer physical pain to build stronger bone and muscle one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience a stronger sense of self increased compassion and a generally happier life our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments its only when we feel intense pain that were willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us we need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we have been deriving meaning in our life and then consider changing course you could call it hitting bottom or having an existential crisis i prefer to call it weathering the shitstorm choose what suits you and perhaps you are in that kind of place right now perhaps you are coming out of the most significant challenge of your life and are bewildered because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite that is goodthats the beginning i cannot stress this enough but pain is part of the process its important to feel it because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities then you will never generate the requisite motivation to actually change when i was young any time my family got a new vcr or stereo i would press every button plug and unplug every cord and cable just to see what everything did with time i learned how the whole system worked and because i knew how it all worked i was often the only person in the house who used the stuff as is the case for many millennial children my parents looked on as if i were some sort of prodigy to them the fact that i could program the vcr without looking at the instruction manual made me the second coming of tesla its easy to look back at my parents generation and chuckle at their technophobia but the further i get into adulthood the more i realize that we all have areas of our lives where were like my parents with the new vcr we sit and stare and shake our heads and say but how when really its as simple as just doing it i get emails from people asking questions like this all the time and for many years i never knew what to say to them there is the girl whose parents are immigrants and saved for their whole lives to put her through med school but now she is in med school and she hates it she does not want to spend her life as a doctor so she wants to drop out more than anything yet she feels stuck so stuck in fact that she ends up emailing a stranger on the internet me and asking him a silly and obvious question like how do i drop out of med school or the college guy who has a crush on his tutor so he agonizes over every sign every laugh every smile every diversion into small talk and emails me a twentyeightpage novella that concludes with the question how do i ask her out or the single mother whose nowadult kids have finished school and are loafing around on her couch eating her food spending her money not respecting her space or her desire for privacy she wants them to move on with their lives she wants to move on with her life yet she is scared to death of pushing her children away scared to the point of asking how do i ask them to move out these are vcr questions from the outside the answer is simple just shut up and do it but from the inside from the perspective of each of these people these questions feel impossibly complex and opaqueexistential riddles wrapped in enigmas packed in a kfc bucket full of rubiks cubes vcr questions are funny because the answer appears difficult to anyone who has them and appears easy to anyone who does not the problem here is pain filling out the appropriate paperwork to drop out of med school is a straightforward and obvious action breaking your parents hearts is not asking a tutor out on a date is as simple as saying the words risking intense embarrassment and rejection feels far more complicated asking someone to move out of your house is a clear decision feeling as if you are abandoning your own children is not i struggled with social anxiety throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life i spent most of my days distracting myself with video games and most of my nights either drinking or smoking away my uneasiness for many years the thought of speaking to a strangerespecially if that stranger happened to be particularly attractiveinterestingpopularsmartfelt impossible to me i walked around in a daze for years asking myself dumb vcr questions how how do you just walk up and talk to a person how can somebody do that i had all sorts of screwedup beliefs about this like that you were not allowed to speak to someone unless you had some practical reason to or that women would think i was a creepy rapist if i so much as said hello the problem was that my emotions defined my reality because it felt like people did not want to talk to me i came to believe that people did not want to talk to me and thus my vcr question how do you just walk up and talk to a person because i failed to separate what i felt from what was i was incapable of stepping outside myself and seeing the world for what it was a simple place where two people can walk up to each other at any time and speak many people when they feel some form of pain or anger or sadness drop everything and attend to numbing out whatever they are feeling their goal is to get back to feeling good again as quickly as possible even if that means substances or deluding themselves or returning to their shitty values learn to sustain the pain you have chosen when you choose a new value you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life relish it savor it welcome it with open arms then act despite it i will not lie this is going to feel impossibly hard at first but you can start simple you are going to feel as though you do not know what to do but we have discussed this you do not know anything even when you think you do you really do not know what the fuck you are doing so really what is there to lose life is about not knowing and then doing something anyway all of life is like this it never changes even when you are happy even when you are farting fairy dust even when you win the lottery and buy a small fleet of jet skis you still will not know what the hell you are doing do not ever forget that and do not ever be afraid of that the do something principle in 2008 after holding down a day job for all of six weeks i gave up on the whole job thing to pursue an online business at the time i had absolutely no clue what i was doing but i figured if i was going to be broke and miserable i might as well be while working on my own terms and at that time all i seemed to really care about was chasing girls so fuck it i decided to start a blog about my crazy dating life that first morning that i woke up selfemployed terror quickly consumed me i found myself sitting with my laptop and realized for the first time that i was entirely responsible for all of my own decisions as well as the consequences of those decisions i was responsible for teaching myself web design internet marketing search engine optimization and other esoteric topics it was all on my shoulders now and so i did what any twentyfouryearold who would just quit his job and had no idea what he was doing would do i downloaded some computer games and avoided work like it was the ebola virus as the weeks went on and my bank account turned from black to red it was clear that i needed to come up with some sort of strategy to get myself to put in the twelve or fourteenhour days that were necessary to get a new business off the ground and that plan came from an unexpected place when i was in high school my math teacher mr packwood used to say if you are stuck on a problem do not sit there and think about it just start working on it even if you do not know what you are doing the simple act of working on it will eventually because the right ideas to show up in your head during that early selfemployment period when i struggled every day completely clueless about what to do and terrified of the results or lack thereof mr packwoods advice started beckoning me from the recesses of my mind i heard it like a mantra do not just sit there do something the answers will follow in the course of applying mr packwoods advice i learned a powerful lesson about motivation it took about eight years for this lesson to sink in but what i discovered over those long grueling months of bombed product launches laughable advice columns uncomfortable nights on friends couches overdrawn bank accounts and hundreds of thousands of words written most of them unread was perhaps the most important thing i have ever learned in my life action is not just the effect of motivation its also the because of it most of us commit to action only if we feel a certain level of motivation and we feel motivation only when we feel enough emotional inspiration we assume that these steps occur in a sort of chain reaction like this emotional inspiration  motivation  desirable action if you want to accomplish something but do not feel motivated or inspired then you assume you are just screwed there is nothing you can do about it its not until a major emotional life event occurs that you can generate enough motivation to actually get off the couch and do something the thing about motivation is that its not only a threepart chain but an endless loop inspiration  motivation  action  inspiration  motivation  action  etc your actions create further emotional reactions and inspirations and move on to motivate your future actions taking advantage of this knowledge we can actually reorient our mindset in the following way action  inspiration  motivation if you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life do somethinganything reallyand then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself i call this the do something principle after using it myself to build my business i began teaching it to readers who came to me perplexed by their own vcr questions how do i apply for a job or how do i tell this guy i want to be his girlfriend and the like during the first couple years i worked for myself entire weeks would go by without my accomplishing much for no other reason than that i was anxious and stressed about what i had to do and it was too easy to put everything off i quickly learned though that forcing myself to do something even the most menial of tasks quickly made the larger tasks seem much easier if i had to redesign an entire website id force myself to sit down and would say okay ill just design the header right now but after the header was done id find myself moving on to other parts of the site and before i knew it id be energized and engaged in the project the author tim ferriss relates a story he once heard about a novelist who had written over seventy novels someone asked the novelist how he was able to write so consistently and remain inspired and motivated he replied two hundred crappy words per day that is it the idea was that if he forced himself to write two hundred crappy words more often than not the act of writing would inspire him and before he knew it he would have thousands of words down on the page if we follow the do something principle failure feels unimportant when the standard of success becomes merely actingwhen any result is regarded as progress and important when inspiration is seen as a reward rather than a prerequisitewe propel ourselves ahead we feel free to fail and that failure moves us forward the do something principle not only helps us overcome procrastination but its also the process by which we adopt new values if you are in the midst of an existential shitstorm and everything feels meaninglessif all the ways you used to measure yourself have come up short and you have no idea what is next if you know that you have been hurting yourself chasing false dreams or if you know that there is some better metric you should be measuring yourself with but you do not know howthe answer is the same do something that something can be the smallest viable action toward something else it can be anything recognize that you have been an entitled prick in all of your relationships and want to start developing more compassion for others do something start simple make it a goal to listen to someone is problem and give some of your time to helping that person just do it once or promise yourself that you will assume that you are the root of your problems next time you get upset just try on the idea and see how it feels that is often all that is necessary to get the snowball rolling the action needed to inspire the motivation to keep going you can become your own source of inspiration you can become your own source of motivation action is always within reach and with simply doing something as your only metric for successwell then even failure pushes you forward     chapter 8 the importance of saying no in 2009 i gathered up all my possessions sold them or put them into storage left my apartment and set off for latin america by this time my little dating advice blog was getting some traffic and i was actually making a modest amount of money selling pdfs and courses online i planned on spending much of the next few years living abroad experiencing new cultures and taking advantage of the lower cost of living in a number of developing countries in asia and latin america to build my business further it was the digital nomad dream and as a twentyfiveyearold adventureseeker it was exactly what i wanted out of life but as sexy and heroic as my plan sounded not all of the values driving me to this nomadic lifestyle were healthy ones sure i had some admirable values going ona thirst to see the world a curiosity for people and culture some oldfashioned adventureseeking but there also existed a faint outline of shame underlying everything else at the time i was hardly aware of it but if i was completely honest with myself i knew there was a screwedup value lurking there somewhere beneath the surface i could not see it but in quiet moments when i was completely honest with myself i could feel it along with the entitlement of my early twenties the real traumatic shit of my teenage years had left me with a nice bundle of commitment issues i had spent the past few years overcompensating for the inadequacy and social anxiety of my teenager years and as a result i felt like i could meet anybody i wanted be friends with anybody i wanted love anybody i wanted have sex with anybody i wantedso why would i ever commit to a single person or even a single social group a single city or country or culture if i could experience everything equally then i should experience them all equally right armed with this grandiose sense of connectivity to the world i bounced back and forth across countries and oceans in a game of global hopscotch that lasted over five years i visited fiftyfive countries made dozens of friends and found myself in the arms of a number of loversall of whom were quickly replaced and some of whom were already forgotten by the next flight to the next country it was a strange life replete with fantastic horizonbreaching experiences as well as superficial highs designed to numb my underlying pain it seemed both so profound yet so meaningless at the same time and still does some of my greatest life lessons and characterdefining moments came on the road during this period but some of the biggest wastes of my time and energy came during this period as well now i live in new york i have a house and furniture and an electric bill and a wife none of it is particularly glamorous or exciting and i like it that way because after all the years of excitement the biggest lesson i took from my adventuring was this absolute freedom by itself means nothing freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it ultimately the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in ones life is through a rejection of alternatives a narrowing of freedom a choice of commitment to one place one belief or gulp one person this realization came to me slowly over the course of my years traveling as with most excesses in life you have to drown yourself in them to realize that they do not make you happy such was traveling with me as i drowned in my fiftythird fiftyfourth fiftyfifth country i began to understand that while all of my experiences were exciting and great few of them would have any lasting significance whereas my friends back home were settling down into marriages buying houses and giving their time to interesting companies or political causes i was floundering from one high to the next in 2011 i traveled to saint petersburg russia the food sucked the weather sucked snow in may are you fucking kidding me my apartment sucked nothing worked everything was overpriced the people were rude and smelled funny nobody smiled and everyone drank too much yet i loved it it was one of my favorite trips there is a bluntness to russian culture that generally rubs westerners the wrong way gone are the fake niceties and verbal webs of politeness you do not smile at strangers or pretend to like anything you do not in russia if something is stupid you say its stupid if someone is being an asshole you tell him hes being an asshole if you really like someone and are having a great time you tell her that you like her and are having a great time it does not matter if this person is your friend a stranger or someone you met five minutes ago on the street the first week i found all of this really uncomfortable i went on a coffee date with a russian girl and within three minutes of sitting down she looked at me funny and told me that what id just said was stupid i nearly choked on my drink there was nothing combative about the way she said it it was spoken as if it were some mundane factlike the quality of the weather that day or her shoe sizebut i was still shocked after all in the west such outspokenness is seen as highly offensive especially from someone you just met but it went on like this with everyone everyone came across as rude all the time and as a result my westerncoddled mind felt attacked on all sides nagging insecurities began to surface in situations where they had not existed in years but as the weeks wore on i got used to the russian frankness much as i did the midnight sunsets and the vodka that went down like ice water and then i started appreciating it for what it really was unadulterated expression honesty in the truest sense of the word communication with no conditions no strings attached no ulterior motive no sales job no desperate attempt to be liked somehow after years of travel it was in perhaps the most unamerican of places where i first experienced a particular flavor of freedom the ability to say whatever i thought or felt without fear of repercussion it was a strange form of liberation through accepting rejection and as someone who had been starved of this kind of blunt expression most of his lifefirst by an emotionally repressed family life then later by a meticulously constructed false display of confidencei got drunk on it like well like it was the finest damn vodka id ever had the month i spent in saint petersburg went by in a blur and by the end i did not want to leave travel is a fantastic selfdevelopment tool because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves this exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps its not necessarily the best way to live in this case russia had me reexamining the bullshitty fakenice communication that is so common in anglo culture and asking myself if this was not somehow making us more insecure around each other and worse at intimacy i remember discussing this dynamic with my russian teacher one day and he had an interesting theory having lived under communism for so many generations with little to no economic opportunity and caged by a culture of fear russian society found the most valuable currency to be trust and to build trust you have to be honest that means when things suck you say so openly and without apology peoples displays of unpleasant honesty were rewarded for the simple fact that they were necessary for survivalyou had to know whom you could rely on and whom you could not and you needed to know quickly but in the free west my russian teacher continued there existed an abundance of economic opportunityso much economic opportunity that it became far more valuable to present yourself in a certain way even if it was false than to actually be that way trust lost its value appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expression knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely this is why it became the norm in western cultures to smile and say polite things even when you do not feel like it to tell little white lies and agree with someone whom you do not actually agree with this is why people learn to pretend to be friends with people they do not actually like to buy things they do not actually want the economic system promotes such deception the downside of this is that you never know in the west if you can completely trust the person you are talking to sometimes this is the case even among good friends or family members there is such pressure in the west to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they are dealing with rejection makes your life better as an extension of our positivityconsumer culture many of us have been indoctrinated with the belief that we should try to be as inherently accepting and affirmative as possible this is a cornerstone of many of the socalled positive thinking books open yourself up to opportunities be accepting say yes to everything and everyone and so on but we need to reject something otherwise we stand for nothing if nothing is better or more desirable than anything else then we are empty and our life is meaningless we are without values and therefore live our life without any purpose the avoidance of rejection both giving and receiving it is often sold to us as a way to make ourselves feel better but avoiding rejection gives us shortterm pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term to truly appreciate something you must confine yourself to it there is a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you have spent decades investing in a single relationship a single craft a single career and you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting the alternatives the act of choosing a value for yourself requires rejecting alternative values if i choose to make my marriage the most important part of my life that means i am probably choosing not to make cocainefueled hooker orgies an important part of my life if i am choosing to judge myself based on my ability to have open and accepting friendships that means i am rejecting trashing my friends behind their backs these are all healthy decisions yet they require rejection at every turn the point is this we all must give a fuck about something in order to value something and to value something we must reject what is not that something to value x we must reject nonx that rejection is an inherent and necessary part of maintaining our values and therefore our identity we are defined by what we choose to reject and if we reject nothing perhaps in fear of being rejected by something ourselves we essentially have no identity at all the desire to avoid rejection at all costs to avoid confrontation and conflict the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize is a deep and subtle form of entitlement entitled people because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad and because they refuse to reject anything they live a valueless pleasuredriven and selfabsorbed life all they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer to avoid the inevitable failures of their life to pretend the suffering away rejection is an important and crucial life skill nobody wants to be stuck in a relationship that is not making them happy nobody wants to be stuck in a business doing work they hate and do not believe in nobody wants to feel that they cannot say what they really mean yet people choose these things all the time honesty is a natural human craving but part of having honesty in our lives is becoming comfortable with saying and hearing the word no in this way rejection actually makes our relationships better and our emotional lives healthier boundaries once upon a time there were two youngsters a boy and a girl their families hated each other but the boy snuck into a party hosted by the girls family because he was kind of a dick the girl sees the boy and angels sing so sweetly to her ladyparts that she instantly falls in love with him just like that and so he sneaks into her garden and they decide to get married the next freaking day because you know that is totally practical especially when your parents want to murder each other jump ahead a few days their families find out about the marriage and throw a shitfit mercutio dies the girl is so upset that she drinks a potion that will put her to sleep for two days but unfortunately the young couple has not learned the ins and outs of good marital communication yet and the young girl totally forgets to mention something about it to her new husband the young man therefore mistakes his new wifes selfinduced coma for suicide he then totally loses his marbles and he commits suicide thinking hes going to be with her in the afterlife or some shit but then she wakes up from her twoday coma only to learn that her new husband has committed suicide so she has the exact same idea and kills herself too the end romeo and juliet is synonymous with romance in our culture today it is seen as the love story in englishspeaking culture an emotional ideal to live up to yet when you really get down to what happens in the story these kids are absolutely out of their fucking minds and they just killed themselves to prove it its suspected by many scholars that shakespeare wrote romeo and juliet not to celebrate romance but rather to satirize it to show how absolutely nutty it was he did not mean for the play to be a glorification of love in fact he meant it to be the opposite a big flashing neon sign blinking keep out with police tape around it saying do not cross for most of human history romantic love was not celebrated as it is now in fact up until the midnineteenth century or so love was seen as an unnecessary and potentially dangerous psychological impediment to the more important things in lifeyou know like farming well andor marrying a guy with a lot of sheep young people were often forcibly steered clear of their romantic passions in favor of practical economic marriages that would yield stability for both them and their families but today we all get brain boners for this kind of batshit crazy love it dominates our culture and the more dramatic the better whether its ben affleck working to destroy an asteroid to save the earth for the girl he loves or mel gibson murdering hundreds of englishmen and fantasizing about his raped and murdered wife while being tortured to death or that elven chick giving up her immortality to be with aragorn in lord of the rings or stupid romantic comedies where jimmy fallon forgoes his red sox playoff tickets because drew barrymore has like needs or something if this sort of romantic love were cocaine then as a culture wed all be like tony montana in scarface burying our faces in a fucking mountain of it screaming say hello to my leetle friend the problem is that were finding out that romantic love is kind of like cocaine like frighteningly similar to cocaine like stimulates the exact same parts of your brain as cocaine like gets you high and makes you feel good for a while but also creates as many problems as it solves as does cocaine most elements of romantic love that we pursuethe dramatic and dizzyingly emotional displays of affection the topsyturvy ups and downsarent healthy genuine displays of love in fact they are often just another form of entitlement playing out through peoples relationships i know that makes me sound like such a downer seriously what kind of guy shits on romantic love but hear me out the truth is there are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each otherin other words they are using each other as an escape healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each others support the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things 1 how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility and 2 the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner anywhere there is an unhealthy or toxic relationship there will be a poor and porous sense of responsibility on both sides and there will be an inability to give andor receive rejection wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary by boundaries i mean the delineation between two peoples responsibilities for their own problems people in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partners values and problems people in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems andor take responsibility for their partners problems what do poor boundaries look like here are some examples you cannot go out with your friends without me you know how jealous i get you have to stay home with me my coworkers are idiots they always make me late to meetings because i have to tell them how to do their jobs i cannot believe you made me feel so stupid in front of my own sister never disagree with me in front of her again id love to take that job in milwaukee but my mother would never forgive me for moving so far away i can date you but can you not tell my friend cindy she gets really insecure when i have a boyfriend and she does not in each scenario the person is either taking responsibility for problemsemotions that are not theirs or demanding that someone else take responsibility for their problemsemotions in general entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships either they expect other people to take responsibility for their problems i wanted a nice relaxing weekend at home you should have known that and canceled your plans or they take on too much responsibility for other peoples problems she just lost her job again but its probably my fault because i was not as supportive of her as i could have been i am going to help her rewrite her resume tomorrow entitled people adopt these strategies in their relationships as with everything to help avoid accepting responsibility for their own problems as a result their relationships are fragile and fake products of avoiding inner pain rather than embracing a genuine appreciation and adoration of their partner this goes not just for romantic relationships by the way but also for family relationships and friendships an overbearing mother may take responsibility for every problem in her childrens lives her own entitlement then encourages an entitlement in her children as they grow up to believe other people should always be responsible for their problems this is why the problems in your romantic relationships always eerily resemble the problems in your parents relationship when you have murky areas of responsibility for your emotions and actionsareas where its unclear who is responsible for what whose fault is what why you are doing what you are doingyou never develop strong values for yourself your only value becomes making your partner happy or your only value becomes your partner making you happy this is selfdefeating of course and relationships characterized by such murkiness usually go down like the hindenburg with all the drama and fireworks people cannot solve your problems for you and they should not try because that will not make you happy you cannot solve other peoples problems for them either because that likewise will not make them happy the mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each others problems in order to feel good about themselves rather a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other the setting of proper boundaries does not mean you cannot help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself you both should support each other but only because you choose to support and be supported not because you feel obligated or entitled entitled people who blame others for their own emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they constantly paint themselves as victims eventually someone will come along and save them and they will receive the love they have always wanted entitled people who take the blame for other peoples emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they fix their partner and save him or her they will receive the love and appreciation they have always wanted these are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship the victim and the saver the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important these two types of people are drawn strongly to one another and they usually end up together their pathologies match one another perfectly often they have grown up with parents who each exhibit one of these traits as well so their model for a happy relationship is one based on entitlement and poor boundaries sadly they both fail in meeting the others actual needs in fact their pattern of overblaming and overaccepting blame perpetuates the entitlement and shitty selfworth that have been keeping them from getting their emotional needs met in the first place the victim creates more and more problems to solvenot because additional real problems exist but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves the saver solves and solvesnot because she actually cares about the problems but because she believes she must fix others problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself in both cases the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore selfsabotaging and genuine love is rarely experienced the victim if he really loved the saver would say look this is my problem you do not have to fix it for me just support me while i fix it myself that would actually be a demonstration of love taking responsibility for your own problems and not holding your partner responsible for them if the saver really wanted to save the victim the saver would say look you are blaming others for your own problems deal with this yourself and in a sick way that would actually be a demonstration of love helping someone solve their own problems instead victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs its like an addiction they fulfill in one another ironically when presented with emotionally healthy people to date they usually feel bored or lack chemistry with them they pass on emotionally healthy secure individuals because the secure partners solid boundaries do not feel exciting enough to stimulate the constant highs necessary in the entitled person for victims the hardest thing to do in the world is to hold themselves accountable for their problems they have spent their whole life believing that others are responsible for their fate that first step of taking responsibility for themselves is often terrifying for savers the hardest thing to do in the world is to stop taking responsibility for other peoples problems they have spent their whole life feeling valued and loved only when they are saving somebody elseso letting go of this need is terrifying to them as well if you make a sacrifice for someone you care about it needs to be because you want to not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so if your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to not because you have manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt acts of love are valid only if they are performed without conditions or expectations it can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily so here is a litmus test ask yourself if i refused how would the relationship change similarly ask if my partner refused something i wanted how would the relationship change if the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates then that is a bad sign for your relationship it suggests that your relationship is conditionalbased on superficial benefits received from one another rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other along with each others problems people with strong boundaries are not afraid of a temper tantrum an argument or getting hurt people with weak boundaries are terrified of those things and will constantly mold their own behavior to fit the highs and lows of their relational emotional roller coaster people with strong boundaries understand that its unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has people with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone is feelings sometimes but ultimately they cannot determine how other people feel people with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one anothers emotions but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems its not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about its about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives that is unconditional love baby how to build trust my wife is one of those women who spend a lot of time in front of the mirror she loves to look amazing and i love for her to look amazing too obviously nights before we go out she comes out of the bathroom after an hourlong makeuphairclotheswhateverwomendointhere session and asks me how she looks she is usually gorgeous every once in a while though she looks bad maybe she tried to do something new with her hair or decided to wear a pair of boots that some flamboyant fashion designer from milan thought were avantgarde whatever the reasonit just does not work when i tell her this she usually gets pissed off as she marches back into the closet or the bathroom to redo everything and make us thirty minutes late she spouts a bunch of fourletter words and sometimes even slings a few of them in my direction men stereotypically lie in this situation to make their girlfriendswives happy but i do not why because honesty in my relationship is more important to me than feeling good all the time the last person i should ever have to censor myself with is the woman i love fortunately i am married to a woman who agrees and is willing to hear my uncensored thoughts she calls me out on my bullshit too of course which is one of the most important traits she offers me as a partner sure my ego gets bruised sometimes and i bitch and complain and try to argue but a few hours later i come sulking back and admit that she was right and holy crap she makes me a better person even though i hate hearing it at the time when our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good or to always make our partner feel good then nobody ends up feeling good and our relationship falls apart without our even knowing it without conflict there can be no trust conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits no one trusts a yesman if disappointment panda were here he would tell you that the pain in our relationship is necessary to cement our trust in each other and produce greater intimacy for a relationship to be healthy both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no without that negation without that occasional rejection boundaries break down and one persons problems and values come to dominate the others conflict is not only normal then its absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship if two people who are close are not able to hash out their differences openly and vocally then the relationship is based on manipulation and misrepresentation and it will slowly become toxic trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship for the simple reason that without trust the relationship does not actually mean anything a person could tell you that she loves you wants to be with you would give up everything for you but if you do not trust her you get no benefit from those statements you do not feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed toward you comes without any special conditions or baggage attached to it this is what is so destructive about cheating its not about the sex its about the trust that has been destroyed as a result of the sex without trust the relationship can no longer function so its either rebuild the trust or say your goodbyes i often get emails from people who have been cheated on by their significant other but want to stay with that partner and are wondering how they can trust him or her again without trust they tell me the relationship has begun to feel like a burden like a threat that must be monitored and questioned rather than enjoyed the problem here is that most people who get caught cheating apologize and give the it will never happen again spiel and that is that as if penises fell into various orifices completely by accident many cheatees accept this response at face value and do not question the values and fucks given by their partner pun totally intended they do not ask themselves whether those values and fucks make their partner a good person to stay with they are so concerned with holding on to their relationship that they fail to recognize that its become a black hole consuming their selfrespect if people cheat its because something other than the relationship is more important to them it may be power over others it may be validation through sex it may be giving in to their own impulses whatever it is its clear that the cheaters values are not aligned in a way to support a healthy relationship and if the cheater does not admit this or come to terms with it if he just gives the old i do not know what i was thinking i was stressed out and drunk and she was there response then he lacks the serious selfawareness necessary to solve any relationship problems what needs to happen is that cheaters have to start peeling away at their selfawareness onion and figure out what fuckedup values caused them to break the trust of the relationship and whether they actually still value the relationship they need to be able to say you know what i am selfish i care about myself more than the relationship to be honest i do not really respect the relationship much at all if cheaters cannot express their shitty values and show that those values have been overridden then there is no reason to believe that they can be trusted and if they cannot be trusted then the relationship is not going to get better or change the other factor in regaining trust after its been broken is a practical one a track record if someone breaks your trust words are nice but you then need to see a consistent track record of improved behavior only then can you begin trusting that the cheaters values are now aligned properly and the person really will change unfortunately building a track record for trust takes timecertainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust and during that trustbuilding period things are likely to be pretty shitty so both people in the relationship must be conscious of the struggle they are choosing to undertake i use the example of cheating in a romantic relationship but this process applies to a breach in any relationship when trust is destroyed it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen 1 the trustbreaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them and 2 the trustbreaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time without the first step there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place trust is like a china plate if you break it once with some care and attention you can put it back together again but if you break it again it splits into even more pieces and it takes far longer to piece together again if you break it more and more times eventually it shatters to the point where its impossible to restore there are too many broken pieces and too much dust freedom through commitment consumer culture is very good at making us want more more more underneath all the hype and marketing is the implication that more is always better i bought into this idea for years make more money visit more countries have more experiences be with more women but more is not always better in fact the opposite is true we are actually often happier with less when were overloaded with opportunities and options we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice basically the more options were given the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose because were aware of all the other options were potentially forfeiting so if you have a choice between two places to live and pick one you will likely feel confident and comfortable that you made the right choice you will be satisfied with your decision but if you have a choice among twentyeight places to live and pick one the paradox of choice says that you will likely spend years agonizing doubting and secondguessing yourself wondering if you really made the right choice and if you are truly maximizing your own happiness and this anxiety this desire for certainty and perfection and success will make you unhappy so what do we do well if you are like i used to be you avoid choosing anything at all you aim to keep your options open as long as possible you avoid commitment but while investing deeply in one person one place one job one activity might deny us the breadth of experience wed like pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience there are some experiences that you can have only when you have lived in the same place for five years when you have been with the same person for over a decade when you have been working on the same skill or craft for half your lifetime now that i am in my thirties i can finally recognize that commitment in its own way offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never be available to me no matter where i went or what i did when you are pursuing a wide breadth of experience there are diminishing returns to each new adventure each new person or thing when you have never left your home country the first country you visit inspires a massive perspective shift because you have such a narrow experience base to draw on but when you have been to twenty countries the twentyfirst adds little and when you have been to fifty the fiftyfirst adds even less the same goes for material possessions money hobbies jobs friends and romanticsexual partnersall the lame superficial values people choose for themselves the older you get the more experienced you get the less significantly each new experience affects you the first time i drank at a party was exciting the hundredth time was fun the five hundredth time felt like a normal weekend and the thousandth time felt boring and unimportant the big story for me personally over the past few years has been my ability to open myself up to commitment i have chosen to reject all but the very best people and experiences and values in my life i shut down all my business projects and decided to focus on writing fulltime since then my website has become more popular than id ever imagined possible i have committed to one woman for the long haul and to my surprise have found this more rewarding than any of the flings trysts and onenight stands i had in the past i have committed to a single geographic location and doubled down on the handful of my significant genuine healthy friendships and what i have discovered is something entirely counterintuitive that there is a freedom and liberation in commitment i have found increased opportunity and upside in rejecting alternatives and distractions in favor of what i have chosen to let truly matter to me commitment gives you freedom because you are no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy commitment makes decisionmaking easier and removes any fear of missing out knowing that what you already have is good enough why would you ever stress about chasing more more more again commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would in this way the rejection of alternatives liberates usrejection of what does not align with our most important values with our chosen metrics rejection of the constant pursuit of breadth without depth yes breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you are youngafter all you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in but depth is where the gold is buried and you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up that is true in relationships in a career in building a great lifestylein everything    chapter 9    and then you die seek the truth for yourself and i will meet you there that was the last thing josh ever said to me he said it ironically attempting to sound deep while simultaneously making fun of people who attempt to sound deep he was drunk and high and he was a good friend the most transformational moment of my life occurred when i was nineteen years old my friend josh had taken me to a party on a lake just north of dallas texas there were condos on a hill and below the hill was a pool and below the pool was a cliff overlooking the lake it was a small cliff maybe thirty feet highcertainly high enough to give you a second thought about jumping but low enough that with the right combination of alcohol and peer pressure that second thought could easily vanish shortly after arriving at the party josh and i sat in the pool together drinking beers and talking as young angsty males do we talked about drinking and bands and girls and all of the cool stuff josh had done that summer since dropping out of music school we talked about playing in a band together and moving to new york cityan impossible dream at the time we were just kids is it okay to jump off that i asked after a while nodding toward the cliff over the lake yeah josh said people do it all the time here are you going to do it he shrugged maybe well see later in the evening josh and i got separated i had become distracted by a pretty asian girl who liked video games which to me as a teenage nerd was akin to winning the lottery she had no interest in me but she was friendly and happy to let me talk so i talked after a few beers i gathered enough courage to ask her to go up to the house with me to get some food she said sure as we walked up the hill we bumped into josh coming down i asked him if he wanted food but he declined i asked him where i could find him later on he smiled and said seek the truth for yourself and i will meet you there i nodded and made a serious face okay ill see you there i replied as if everyone knew exactly where the truth was and how to get to it josh laughed and walked down the hill toward the cliff i laughed and continued up the hill toward the house i do not remember how long i was inside i just remember that when the girl and i came out again everyone was gone and there were sirens the pool was empty people were running down the hill toward the shoreline below the cliff there were others already down by the water i could make out a couple guys swimming around it was dark and hard to see the music droned on but nobody listened still not putting twoandtwo together i hurried down to the shoreline gnawing on my sandwich curious as to what everyone was looking at halfway down the pretty asian girl said to me i think something terrible has happened when i got to the bottom of the hill i asked someone where josh was no one looked at me or acknowledged me everyone stared at the water i asked again and a girl started crying uncontrollably that is when i put twoandtwo together it took scuba divers three hours to find joshs body at the bottom of the lake the autopsy would later say that his legs had cramped up due to dehydration from the alcohol as well as to the impact of the jump from the cliff it was dark out when he went in the water layered on the night black on black no one could see where his screams for help were coming from just the splashes just the sounds his parents later told me that he was a terrible swimmer id had no idea it took me twelve hours to let myself cry i was in my car driving back home to austin the next morning i called my dad and told him that i was still near dallas and that i was going to miss work id been working for him that summer he asked why what happened is everything all right and that is when it all came out the waterworks the wails and the screams and the snot i pulled the car over to the side of the road and clutched the phone and cried the way a little boy cries to his father i went into a deep depression that summer i thought id been depressed before but this was a whole new level of meaninglessnesssadness so deep that it physically hurt people would come by and try to cheer me up and i would sit there and hear them say all the right things and do all the right things and i would tell them thank you and how nice it was of them to come over and i would fake a smile and lie and say that it was getting better but underneath i just felt nothing i dreamed about josh for a few months after that dreams where he and i would have fullblown conversations about life and death as well as about random pointless things up until that point in my life i had been a pretty typical middleclass stoner kid lazy irresponsible socially anxious and deeply insecure josh in many ways had been a person i looked up to he was older more confident more experienced and more accepting of and open to the world around him in one of my last dreams of josh i was sitting in a jacuzzi with him yeah i know weird and i said something like i am really sorry you died he laughed i do not remember exactly what his words were but he said something like why do you care that i am dead when you are still so afraid to live i woke up crying it was sitting on my moms couch that summer staring into the socalled abyss seeing the endless and incomprehensible nothingness where joshs friendship used to be when i came to the startling realization that if there really is no reason to do anything then there is also no reason to not do anything that in the face of the inevitability of death there is no reason to ever give in to ones fear or embarrassment or shame since its all just a bunch of nothing anyway and that by spending the majority of my short life avoiding what was painful and uncomfortable i had essentially been avoiding being alive at all that summer i gave up the weed and the cigarettes and the video games i gave up my silly rock star fantasies and dropped out of music school and signed up for college courses i started going to the gym and lost a bunch of weight i made new friends i got my first girlfriend for the first time in my life i actually studied for classes gaining me the startling realization that i could make good grades if only i gave a shit the next summer i challenged myself to read fifty nonfiction books in fifty days and then did it the following year i transferred to an excellent university on the other side of the country where i excelled for the first time both academically and socially joshs death marks the clearest beforeafter point i can identify in my life pretragedy i was inhibited unambitious forever obsessed and confined by what i imagined the world might be thinking of me posttragedy i morphed into a new person responsible curioushardworking i still had my insecurities and my baggageas we always dobut now i gave a fuck about something more important than my insecurities and my baggage and that made all the difference oddly it was someone elses death that gave me permission to finally live and perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational death scares us and because it scares us we avoid thinking about it talking about it sometimes even acknowledging it even when its happening to someone close to us yet in a bizarre backwards way death is the light by which the shadow of all of lifes meaning is measured without death everything would feel inconsequential all experience arbitrary all metrics and values suddenly zero something beyond our selves ernest becker was an academic outcast in 1960 he got his phd in anthropology his doctoral research compared the unlikely and unconventional practices of zen buddhism and psychoanalysis at the time zen was seen as something for hippies and drug addicts and freudian psychoanalysis was considered a quack form of psychology left over from the stone age in his first job as an assistant professor becker quickly fell into a crowd that denounced the practice of psychiatry as a form of fascism they saw the practice as an unscientific form of oppression against the weak and helpless the problem was that beckers boss was a psychiatrist so it was kind of like walking into your first job and proudly comparing your boss to hitler as you can imagine he was fired so becker took his radical ideas somewhere that they might be accepted berkeley california but this too did not last long because it was not just his antiestablishment tendencies that got becker into trouble it was his odd teaching methods as well he would use shakespeare to teach psychology psychology textbooks to teach anthropology and anthropological data to teach sociology he would dress up as king lear and do mock sword fights in class and go on long political rants that had little to do with the lesson plan his students adored him the other faculty loathed him less than a year later he was fired again becker then landed at san francisco state university where he actually kept his job for more than a year but when student protests erupted over the vietnam war the university called in the national guard and things got violent when becker sided with the students and publicly condemned the actions of the dean again his boss being hitleresque and everything he was once again promptly fired becker changed jobs four times in six years and before he could get fired from the fifth he got colon cancer the prognosis was grim he spent the next few years bedridden and had little hope of surviving so becker decided to write a book this book would be about death becker died in 1974 his book the denial of death would win the pulitzer prize and become one of the most influential intellectual works of the twentieth century shaking up the fields of psychology and anthropology while making profound philosophical claims that are still influential today the denial of death essentially makes two points 1    humans are unique in that were the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly dogs do not sit around and worry about their career cats do not think about their past mistakes or wonder what would have happened if they would done something differently monkeys do not argue over future possibilities just as fish do not sit around wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins as humans were blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations to contemplate both the past and the future to imagine other realities or situations where things might be different and its because of this unique mental ability becker says that we all at some point become aware of the inevitability of our own death because were able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it this realization causes what becker calls death terror a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do 2   beckers second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two selves the first self is the physical selfthe one that eats sleeps snores and poops the second self is our conceptual selfour identity or how we see ourselves beckers argument is this we are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die that this death is inevitable and that its inevitabilityon some unconscious levelscares the shit out of us therefore in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever this is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings on statues on spines of books its why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others especially to children in the hopes that our influenceour conceptual selfwill last way beyond our physical self that we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist becker called such efforts our immortality projects projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death all of human civilization he says is basically a result of immortality projects the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us they are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die names like jesus muhammad napoleon and shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived if not more so and that is the whole point whether it be through mastering an art form conquering a new land gaining great riches or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die religion politics sports art and technological innovation are the result of peoples immortality projects becker argues that wars and revolutions and mass murder occur when one group of peoples immortality projects rub up against another groups centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of millions have been justified as the defense of one groups immortality project against anothers but when our immortality projects fail when the meaning is lost when the prospect of our conceptual self outliving our physical self no longer seems possible or likely death terrorthat horrible depressing anxietycreeps back into our mind trauma can cause this as can shame and social ridicule as can as becker points out mental illness if you have not figured it out yet our immortality projects are our values they are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life and when our values fail so do we psychologically speaking what becker is saying in essence is that were all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death and to truly not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasispiritual state of embracing the impermanence of ones own existence in that state one is far less likely to get caught up in various forms of entitlement becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed that peoples immortality projects were actually the problem not the solution that rather than attempting to implement often through lethal force their conceptual self across the world people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death becker called this the bitter antidote and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down his own demise while death is bad it is inevitable therefore we should not avoid this realization but rather come to terms with it as best we can because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own deaththe root terror the underlying anxiety motivating all of lifes frivolous ambitionswe can then choose our values more freely unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality and freed from dangerous dogmatic views the sunny side of death i step from rock to rock climbing steadily leg muscles stretching and aching in that trancelike state that comes from slow repetitive physical exertion i am nearing the top the sky gets wide and deep i am alone now my friends are far below me taking pictures of the ocean finally i climb over a small boulder and the view opens up i can see from here to the infinite horizon it feels as though i am staring at the edge of the earth where water meets the sky blue on blue the wind screams across my skin i look up its bright its beautiful i am at south africas cape of good hope once thought to be the southern tip of africa and the southernmost point in the world its a tumultuous place a place full of storms and treacherous waters a place that is seen centuries of trade and commerce and human endeavor a place ironically of lost hopes there is a saying in portuguese ele dobra o cabo da boa esperanca it means hes rounding the cape of good hope ironically it means that the persons life is in its final phase that hes incapable of accomplishing anything more i step across the rocks toward the blue allowing its vastness to engulf my field of vision i am sweating yet cold excited yet nervous is this it the wind is slapping my ears i hear nothing but i see the edge where the rock meets oblivion i stop and stand for a moment several yards away i can see the ocean below lapping and frothing against cliffs stretching out for miles to either side the tides are furious against the impenetrable walls straight ahead its a sheer drop of at least fifty yards to the water below to my right tourists are dotted across the landscape below snapping photos and aggregating themselves into antlike formations to my left is asia in front of me is the sky and behind is me is everything i have ever hoped for and brought with me what if this is it what if this is all there is i look around i am alone i take my first step toward the edge of the cliff the human body seems to come equipped with a natural radar for deathinducing situations for example the moment you get within about ten feet of a cliff edge minus guardrail a certain tension digs into your body your back stiffens your skin ripples your eyes become hyperfocused on every detail of your environment your feet feel as though they are made of rock its as if there were a big invisible magnet gently pulling your body back to safety but i fight the magnet i drag the feet made of rock closer to the edge at five feet away your mind joins the party you can now see not only the edge of the cliff but down the cliff face itself which induces all sorts of unwanted visualizations of tripping and falling and tumbling to a splashy death its really fucking far your mind reminds you like really fucking far dude what are you doing stop moving stop it i tell my mind to shut up and keep inching forward at three feet your body goes into fullscale red alert you are now within an errant shoelacetrip of your life ending it feels as though a hefty gust of wind could send you sailing off into that bluebisected eternity your legs shake as do your hands as does your voice in case you need to remind yourself you are not about to plummet to your death the threefoot distance is most peoples absolute limit its just close enough to lean forward and catch a glimpse of the bottom but still far enough to feel as though you are not at any real risk of killing yourself standing that close to the edge of a cliff even one as beautiful and mesmerizing as the cape of good hope induces a heady sense of vertigo and threatens to regurgitate any recent meal is this it is this all there is do i already know everything i will ever know i take another microstep then another two feet now my forward leg vibrates as i put the weight of my body on it i shuffle on against the magnet against my mind against all my better instincts for survival one foot now i am now looking straight down the cliff face i feel a sudden urge to cry my body instinctively crouches protecting itself against something imagined and inexplicable the wind comes in hailstorms the thoughts come in right hooks at one foot you feel like you are floating anything but looking straight down feels as though you are part of the sky itself you actually kind of expect to fall at this point i crouch there for a moment catching my breath collecting my thoughts i force myself to stare down at the water hitting the rocks below me then i look again to my right at the little ants milling about the signage below me snapping photos chasing tour buses on the off chance that somebody somehow sees me this desire for attention is wholly irrational but so is all of this its impossible to make me out up here of course and even if it were not there is nothing that those distant people could say or do all i hear is the wind is this it my body shudders the fear becoming euphoric and blinding i focus my mind and clear my thoughts in a kind of meditation nothing makes you present and mindful like being mere inches away from your own death i straighten up and look out again and find myself smiling i remind myself that its all right to die this willing and even exuberant interfacing with ones own mortality has ancient roots the stoics of ancient greece and rome implored people to keep death in mind at all times in order to appreciate life more and remain humble in the face of its adversities in various forms of buddhism the practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for death while still remaining alive dissolving ones ego into an expansive nothingnessachieving the enlightened state of nirvanais seen as a trial run of letting oneself cross to the other side even mark twain that hairy goofball who came in and left on halleys comet said the fear of death follows from the fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time back on the cliff i bend down slightly leaning back i put my hands on the ground behind me and gently lower myself onto my butt i then gradually slide one leg over the edge of the cliff there is a small rock jutting out of the cliff side i rest my foot on it then i slide my other foot off the edge and put it on the same small rock i sit there a moment leaning back on my palms wind ruffling my hair the anxiety is bearable now as long as i stay focused on the horizon then i sit up straight and look down the cliff again fear shoots back up through my spine electrifying my limbs and laserfocusing my mind on the exact coordinates of every inch of my body the fear is stifling at times but each time it stifles me i empty my thoughts focus my attention on the bottom of the cliff below me force myself to gaze at my potential doom and then to simply acknowledge its existence i was now sitting on the edge of the world at the southernmost tip of hope the gateway to the east the feeling was exhilarating i can feel the adrenaline pumping through my body being so still so conscious never felt so thrilling i listen to the wind and watch the ocean and look out upon the ends of the earthand then i laugh with the light all that it touches being good confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy fragile superficial values in life while most people whittle their days chasing another buck or a little bit more fame and attention or a little bit more assurance that they are right or loved death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question what is your legacy how will the world be different and better when you are gone what mark will you have made what influence will you have caused they say that a butterfly flapping its wings in africa can cause a hurricane in florida well what hurricanes will you leave in your wake as becker pointed out this is arguably the only truly important question in our life yet we avoid thinking about it one because its hard two because its scary three because we have no fucking clue what were doing and when we avoid this question we let trivial and hateful values hijack our brains and take control of our desires and ambitions without acknowledging the everpresent gaze of death the superficial will appear important and the important will appear superficial death is the only thing we can know with any certainty and as such it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions it is the correct answer to all of the questions we should ask but never do the only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you this is the basic root of all happiness whether you are listening to aristotle or the psychologists at harvard or jesus christ or the goddamn beatles they all say that happiness comes from the same thing caring about something greater than yourself believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production this feeling is what people go to church for its what they fight in wars for its what they raise families and save pensions and build bridges and invent cell phones for this fleeting sense of being part of something greater and more unknowable than themselves and entitlement strips this away from us the gravity of entitlement sucks all attention inward toward ourselves causing us to feel as though we are at the center of all of the problems in the universe that we are the one suffering all of the injustices that we are the one who deserves greatness over all others as alluring as it is entitlement isolates us our curiosity and excitement for the world turns in upon itself and reflects our own biases and projections onto every person we meet and every event we experience this feels sexy and enticing and may feel good for a while and sells a lot of tickets but its spiritual poison its these dynamics that plague us now we are so materially well off yet so psychologically tormented in so many lowlevel and shallow ways people relinquish all responsibility demanding that society cater to their feelings and sensibilities people hold on to arbitrary certainties and try to enforce them on others often violently in the name of some madeup righteous because people high on a sense of false superiority fall into inaction and lethargy for fear of trying something worthwhile and failing at it the pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it people declare themselves experts entrepreneurs inventors innovators mavericks and coaches without any reallife experience and they do this not because they actually think they are greater than everybody else they do it because they feel that they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary our culture today confuses great attention and great success assuming them to be the same thing but they are not you are great already whether you realize it or not whether anybody else realizes it or not and its not because you launched an iphone app or finished school a year early or bought yourself a sweetass boat these things do not define greatness you are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to this mere fact this simple optioning for your own values in life already makes you beautiful already makes you successful and already makes you loved even if you do not realize it even if you are sleeping in a gutter and starving you too are going to die and that is because you too were fortunate enough to have lived you may not feel this but go stand on a cliff sometime and maybe you will bukowski once wrote were all going to die all of us what a circus that alone should make us love each other but it does not we are terrorized and flattened by lifes trivialities we are eaten up by nothing looking back on that night out by that lake when i watched my friend joshs body getting fished out of the lake by paramedics i remember staring into the black texas night and watching my ego slowly dissolve into it joshs death taught me much more than i initially realized yes it helped me to seize the day to take responsibility for my choices and to pursue my dreams with less shame and inhibition but these were side effects of a deeper more primary lesson and the primary lesson was this there is nothing to be afraid of ever and reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the yearswhether it be through meditation through reading philosophy or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in south africais the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind this acceptance of my death this understanding of my own fragility has made everything easieruntangling my addictions identifying and confronting my own entitlement accepting responsibility for my own problemssuffering through my fears and uncertainties accepting my failures and embracing rejectionsit has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death the more i peer into the darkness the brighter life gets the quieter the world becomes and the less unconscious resistance i feel to well anything i sit there on the cape for a few minutes taking in everything when i finally decide to get up i put my hands behind me and scoot back then slowly i stand i check the ground around memaking sure there is no errant rock ready to sabotage me having recognized that i am safe i begin to walk back to realityfive feet ten feetmy body restoring itself with each step my feet become lighter i let lifes magnet draw me in as i step back over some rocks back to the main path i look up to see a man staring at me i stop and make eye contact with him um i saw you sitting on the edge over there he says his accent is australian the word there rolls out of his mouth awkwardly he points toward antarctica yeah the view is gorgeous is not it i am smiling he is not he has a serious look on his face i brush my hands off on my shorts my body still buzzing from my surrender there is an awkward silence the aussie stands for a moment perplexed still looking at me clearly thinking of what to say next after a moment he carefully pieces the words together is everything okay how are you feeling i pause for a moment still smiling alive very alive his skepticism breaks and reveals a smile in its place he gives a slight nod and heads down the trail i stand above taking in the view waiting for my friends to arrive on the peak    acknowledgments this book began as a big messy thing and required more than just my own hands to chisel something comprehensible out of it first and foremost thank you to my brilliant and beautiful wife fernanda who never hesitates to say no to me when i need to hear it most not only do you make me a better person but your unconditional love and constant feedback during the writing process were indispensable to my parents for putting up with my shit all these years and continuing to love me anyway in many ways i do not feel as though i fully became an adult until i understood many of the concepts in this book in that sense its been a joy to get to know you as an adult these past few years and to my brother as well i never doubt the existence of mutual love and respect between us even if i sometimes get butthurt that you do not text me back to philip kemper and drew birnietwo big brains that conspire to make my brain appear much larger than it actually is your hard work and brilliance continue to floor me to michael covell for being my intellectual stress test especially when it comes to understanding psychological research and for always challenging me on my assumptions to my editor luke dempsey for mercilessly tightening the screws on my writing and for possibly having an even fouler mouth than i do to my agent mollie glick for helping me define the vision for the book and pushing it much farther into the world than i ever expected to see it go to taylor pearson dan andrews and jodi ettenburg for their support during this process you three kept me both accountable and sane which are the only two things every writer needs and finally to the millions of people who for whatever reason decided to read a pottymouthed asshole from boston writing about life on his blog the flood of emails i have received from those of you willing to open up the most intimate corners of your life to me a complete stranger both humbles me and inspires me at this point in my life i have spent thousands of hours reading and studying these subjects but you all continue to be my true education thank you
